<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice and fully coherent internal logic; traits feel concept-driven rather than organically developed through concrete actions or motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Static structure with minimal progression; reliance on abstract contemplation over causal momentum or meaningful change within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in deep-sea setting enhances mood; claustrophobic details like "creak of stressed metal" and "recycled air" perfectly complement thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (psychic eddies, data streams as thoughts) create intellectual resonance, but emotional engagement remains distant due to inward focus and lack of external stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique spiritual mapping angle, but chopstick-cookbook integration feels contrived; prose stylish without descending into distracting ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on assigned elements disrupts cohesion; thematic underpinnings (spiritual cartography, brokenness-as-path) suggest but don't deliver profound impact.</comment>
