<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks deeper internal conflict or emotional complexity beyond survival logic; motivation is clear but superficially explored. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression with cohesive arc but minimal cause-effect tension beyond countdown; resolution feels functional rather than resonant. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (scents, sounds) create immersive decay and mystery; some elements like "whispering gallery" underutilized. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("map he could read") and existential subtext, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly dense prose in places. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original scent-based navigation and skeletal key avoid clich√©s; "final countdown" and smuggler trope feel somewhat predictable. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere, but tone/character depth could align more tightly; brevity works but limits thematic payoff. </comment>
