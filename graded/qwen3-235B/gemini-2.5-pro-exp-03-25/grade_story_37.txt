<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation feels under-explored, redemptive arc lacks nuanced internal conflict; voice remains generic despite first-person framing</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear arc but uneven pacing; framing device (waiting room) disconnects from flashback structure, disrupting momentum in tight word count</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss and canopy village effectively described, but sterile waiting room lacks sensory integration; contrasts remain superficial</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pretty metaphors (moss as "forest's memory") elevate themes, but emotional beats often told instead of shown; ending feels overly neat</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uncommon premise (yodeling as biological trigger) subverts tropes, but redemption arc follows predictable patterns; some purple prose undermines authenticity</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive structure but relies on convenient transitions; brevity exposes underdeveloped elements rather than maximizing concision's potential</comment>
