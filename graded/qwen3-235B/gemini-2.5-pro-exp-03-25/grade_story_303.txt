<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on contrived encounter, pacing uneven. Concept shapes conclusion but beginning lacks setup for emotional arc. Completion feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers. The spice rack's connection to Cygnus X-7 deepens atmosphere. "Dignified chaos" manifests consistently through energetic descriptions.</comment>
