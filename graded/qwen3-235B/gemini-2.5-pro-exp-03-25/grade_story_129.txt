<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to break generational curses is clear, but personality remains narrowly defined through atmospheric context rather than dynamic behavior; reactions to inherited trauma align with somber portrayal, though distinct 'voice' lacks depth given limited interiority in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses coherently through ritualistic actions with tablecloths and song, culminating in cathartic release; pacing balances exposition and action within word constraints, though the abrupt resolution feels slightly underdeveloped despite logical cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of abandoned rocket site (failed futurism) with textile-based past-trauma confrontation creates evocative atmosphere; sensory details (tarnished ring's coldness, dust-choked air) enhance mood, though broader timeframe of global transformation remains underexplored beyond superficial references.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (stanzas-as-tangled-emotions, psychic torpedo-as-forgiveness) create visceral impact; theme of inherited grief as shatterable cycle resonates subtextually, with ending offering tentative hope while avoiding sentimentalism; emotional arc is shown through symbolic gestures rather than overt declarations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s through unique metaphors (e.g., "bruised with twilight," "sonic wave as healing") but occasionally veers into ornateness; character psychology emphasizes subtle physicality (twitching fingers, tear-tracked dust) over analytical processing, though atmospheric consistency slightly weakens during high-stakes "torpedo" release moment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through thematically linked elements, with brief length serving as deliberate containment rather than limitation; emotional resonance lingers, but thematic ambition occasionally outpaces character depth; creative integration of embroidery/music as exorcism method demonstrates ingenuity.</comment>
