<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's guardedness and ambivalence are deeply entwined with her isolation, but her voice lacks distinctiveness in a first-person context; motivations are clear but could be more layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ritual meal as narrative throughline is precise and purposeful; cause-effect ties to her fear are logical; word limit constraints are expertly managed to create a complete arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Hyper-specific sensory details (crystalline fruits chiming, "sterile air") build a haunting, fully-realized environment; setting is inseparable from emotional tenor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Some phrases flirt with ornate abstraction ("monolithic silence") but generally avoid clich√©; emotional nuance in Elara's "dour amusement" feels authentically human and original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize without contrivance; brevity feels intentional; lingering emotional impact stems from paradoxical interplay of silence and speech as theme.</comment>
