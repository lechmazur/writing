<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's mysterious nature is consistent, and motivation to coax life from barren ground is clear, but limited emotional depth or complexity beyond symbolic representation. Persistence reveals determination but lacks internal conflict or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear beginning-middle-end structure within the constraint, with the comet's alignment driving the action. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally feels static, relying on description over momentum. Resolution is implied but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with rich sensory details (e.g., spectral orchard, baleful comet glare). The eerie, desolate tone complements the concept of defiance against decay. Atmosphere deeply enriches the story’s thematic and aesthetic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "resonance" as instruction) and symbolic imagery creates emotional resonance. Ending feels purposeful but slightly anticlimactic. Writing style elevates impact, though subtext remains somewhat abstract, reducing immediate emotional accessibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive elements (cosmic alignment as agricultural code), but some phrases ("burned twilight") risk purple prose. Sensory details are specific yet occasionally overwhelming. Character reasoning is consistent, with tension between resignation and rebellion feeling organic despite stylized tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Elements are cohesively integrated, though some (like the weathervane) strain plausibility. The concise format serves atmospheric and thematic focus, but the ending lacks a deeper thematic payoff. Lingering questions about the hermit’s ultimate success suggest deliberate ambiguity.</comment>
