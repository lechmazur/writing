<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation for perfection is clear but lacks inner depth beyond surface obsessions; actions align with drive but remain psychologically opaque.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear focus on process creates momentum, but lacks narrative arc or resolution within constraints; repetitive action dominates sparse structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere of isolation and obsession is vividly rendered through sensory details like salt air, fragile kelp, crashing waves, and sterile glass walls.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (goose as metronome, bellows as life-drain) and haunting theme (perfection as self-erasure) elevate the prose into resonant allegory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors avoids clich√©s, but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("indifferent blue"); human nuance in obsession feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively for thematic cohesion, though length struggles to balance introspection with external stakes; lingering unease about obsession lingers.</comment>
