<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's grace manifests in precise movements and scavenging habits, but motivation lacks emotional depth despite actions aligning with it. Distinct voice inconsistently maintained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, compact arc with cause-effect logic in activating device and unintended consequences. Pacing and coherence work within tight constraints, though resolution feels abrupt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work in concert with no superfluous components. Achieves thematic resonance and lingering unease within compressed form.</comment>
