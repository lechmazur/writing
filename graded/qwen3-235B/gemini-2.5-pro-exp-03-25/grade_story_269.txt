<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks depth in showing character nuance; motivations are stated but not fully embodied through action or credible choices. The nostalgic tailor is conceptually anchored but inconsistently textured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure is coherent but compressed; the ritual confession ties the beginning and end, but payoff feels diluted by underdeveloped cause-effect chains in the ascent narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details and atmospheric storm amplify tension; however, some setting elements (e.g., Great Steam Incident) lack contextual anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (mirror, stitching) and thematic resonance, but emotional beats lean on exposition rather than subtext or fully embodied moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; steampunk and parallel lives freshened through tailor lens. Some descriptors verge on mechanical ("borrowed ache") but mostly avoid formulaic prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under word constraints. The ending lingers, but underdeveloped plot threads (e.g., code-breaking mechanics) weaken impact.</comment>
