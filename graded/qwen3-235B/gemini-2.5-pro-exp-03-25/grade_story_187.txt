<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's stoicism feels selectively applied; motivations align with actions but lack deeper psychological nuance. Dialogue reveals determination but not full emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Linear progression fits word limit. Nightmare-trail logic connects to plot, but the teacher's swift concession lacks tension. Pacing controlled, resolution abrupt yet functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts (bland facade vs. magical residue) create immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (chalk dust, sterile earth) and symbolic objects (obsidian eyes, charged wood) deepen mood and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subtext of cultural preservation vs. caution resonates. Dialogue sparse but loaded with thematic weight; ending implies ongoing struggle. Metaphors (floorboard as memory) enrich narrative. Conflict understated but present.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in conceptual overlaps (floorboard history/ritual loss) but risks genre familiarity. Language avoids excessive ornamentation; emotional nuance via subtext over explicit statements. Some tropes (stoic wanderer) subverted through layered motives.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements interwoven cohesively. Word limit strains resolution but suits contemplative tone. Style prioritizes precision over flourish, leaving lingering thematic resonance despite rushed-seeming conclusion.</comment>
