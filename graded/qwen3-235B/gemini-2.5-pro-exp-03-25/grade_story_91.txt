<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arthur's lab origins shape his purpose but lack nuance; motivation to "reawaken beauty" is clear but underexplored; his fedora and physical quirks hint at backstory but don't deeply influence actions or decisions; voice remains atmospheric rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quiet tuning drives the plot but feels conceptually sparse; action/reaction between Arthur and the station systems lacks mechanical specificity; narrative arc is present but minimalist; pacing balanced but thin; cause/effect logical but surface-level.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weather station's sterile machinery contrasts well with Arthur's organic intent; humming ambiance and ghost stories create eerie atmosphere; sensory details (fedora's worn felt, shadow's "resonant frequency") immerse but could be more varied; tone consistently hushed and contemplative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uses evocative metaphors (cloud as "fleeting artwork"); ending delivers thematic resolution with shadow completing its path; shows subtle environmental impact (stirring seeds) rather than stating emotions; central tension between control and organic growth resonates; lacks deeper emotional engagement with Arthur's personal struggles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inventive premise avoids clich√©s but contains occasionally ornate phrasing ("sterile concrete pads," "spectral tales"); metaphors like "cascade of subtle commands" lean generic; maintains consistent tone but edges toward atmospheric vagueness; character psychology feels partially fleshed out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere without strain but remain surface-connected; short length amplifies thematic focus while limiting emotional depth; integrates concepts tightly but could push boundaries further; leaves lingering impression of melancholy beauty rather than provocative resonance.</comment>
