<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond aloofness; motivations hinted at but not deeply explored through action. Ritualistic movement reveals inner conflict but lacks complexity in emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear beginning/end with fading revelry framework. Pacing uneven despite tight word count; emotional climax feels abrupt but not unpersuasive. Logical flow maintained despite minimalist structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory immersion in psychedelic setting amplifies mood. Timeframe/setting symbiosis strong, though limited tactile details prevent full atmospheric transcendence. Visual dominance compensates for weaker olfactory/gustatory elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose creates potent subtext. Ending's fragile peace delivers satisfying thematic closure. Shows rather than states emotional states, though occasional poetic abstraction risks distancing readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally veers toward ornate description ("boil of silence"). Emotional nuance present but sometimes undermined by overdetermined symbolism. Unique concept execution counterbalances sporadic purple prose tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements purposefully interconnected despite high concept density. Brief form feels intentional, with each image serving multiple symbolic functions. Lingering existential questions elevate beyond surface aesthetics.</comment>
