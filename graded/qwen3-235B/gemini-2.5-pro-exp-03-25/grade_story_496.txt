<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Internal conflict is visceral but lacks depth past surface existential angst; motivation for "cosmic verse" feels unanchored from concrete backstory despite poetic yearning</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Fragmentary structure undermines momentum—ambush lacks visceral escalation, emotional resolution feels truncated by tight word count, symbolic throughlines underdeveloped</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sprawling adjectives (e.g., "green-choked avenues," "tenacious wildflowers") often overshadow emotional nuance; metaphor clusters feel consciously curated rather than organically disturbing</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements assembled with artful pretension but never fully cohere; lingering impression of cleverness over emotional sincerity</comment>
