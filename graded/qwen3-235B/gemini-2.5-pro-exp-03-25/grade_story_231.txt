<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and evocative, but motivation lacks sufficient psychological depth; spontaneous actions feel imposed rather than organically tied to established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric momentum builds to a symbolic climax, but lacks narrative arc cohesion; the abrupt transition from palace to balcony weakens spatial logic and cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory specificity in setting (alabaster sills, mournful ship's horn) creates immersive atmosphere that thematically reinforces political oppression and personal defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose delivers emotional resonance through symbolic action ("sown wind/hurricane"), but thematic exploration remains surface-level; subtext about systemic oppression could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some overwritten metaphors ("chaotic humility") border on pretension; while avoids most clich√©s, emotional states often lean on abstract diction rather than visceral embodiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric unity despite tight constraints, though thematic ambition exceeds narrative execution; elements feel intentionally selected but occasionally prioritized over organic character psychology.</comment>
