<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character depth remains surface-level; motivation is stated but not deeply explored through lived experiences or internal conflict. Actions align with traits but lack unexpected human nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure loops effectively but lacks dynamic progression; coherence is maintained but tension and resolution feel static due to the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers; the setting's contrast between urban decay and natural struggle enhances thematic weight and character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layer (maps, pruning) elevates subtext, but emotional resonance is muted by a lack of narrative payoff or escalating tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original use of clandestine manual and coded disclaimers; avoids genre tropes. Occasional overwrought descriptions detract slightly from clarity but not ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but unevenly; some (e.g., disclaimers) feel concept-driven rather than organically motivated. Lingering theme of quiet defiance adds depth.</comment>
