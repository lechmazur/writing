<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong lyrical prose with fresh metaphors undercut slightly by familiar tropes (gunman seeking redemption) and occasional overwrought phrasing ("corroded rapture").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work in harmony with theme, though the story's brevity occasionally prioritizes poetics over nuanced character evolution.</comment>
