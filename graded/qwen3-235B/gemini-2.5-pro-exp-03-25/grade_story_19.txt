<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits (feral, unfiltered perception) inform actions, but motivation's internal logic feels occasionally abstract. Emotional reactions (quiver) are vivid but lack layered nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression via scale discovery is logical but underdevelops the code-word method's stakes. Ending achieves thematic closure but sacrifices narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with hyper-specific sensory details (dandelion textures, metallic tarnish). Setting becomes active participant in thematic resonance (seeds as metaphor).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolic interplay between scale, seeds, and cries creates layered meaning. Writing style elevates through precise metaphors and restrained subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but contains moments of ornate abstraction. Emotional resonance is nuanced, though "unfiltered perception" occasionally feels like authorial imposition vs organic character trait.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under density. Story's brevity accentuates poetic impact while sacrificing conventional narrative momentum.</comment>
