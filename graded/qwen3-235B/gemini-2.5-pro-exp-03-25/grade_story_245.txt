<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's irate nature is well-defined through physical actions and internal monologue, with his motivation (seeking waterfalls to honor Elara) anchoring both consistency and emotional depth. The chopstick as a tangible link to his past feels organic, though subtext around his smuggling life remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear trajectory from fury to ritual to renewed resolve, but the tight word count leaves the resolution feeling abrupt. The cyclical structure (jogging-frustration-ritual-jogging) works thematically, though cause-and-effect around the failed spice run isn't fully integrated into the emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is evocatively described with gritty, tactile details (cracked ferrocrete, stench of decay) that contrast viscerally with Elara's idealized waterfalls. The juxtaposition of industrial decay and mythic beauty enhances both setting and theme, though some elements (e.g., "star-drifter") lack contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (waterfalls as hope, chopstick as memory-anchor) are effective, and the story's central tension between filth and beauty resonates emotionally. The ending's poeticism ("phantom cascade across ruins") lingers, but the narrative's introspective voice occasionally veers toward melodrama without sufficient subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Few overt clich√©s, though "regs/credits" tropes and the "mythic waterfall" quest border on science-fiction familiarity. The tea-leaf ritual adds originality, grounded in specific character history. Emotional nuance prevails over exposition, though the chopstick's symbolic weight occasionally strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative logically, with the spaceport and memorialization ritual tightly fused with theme. The brevity feels intentional but rushed in pacing key moments (thermos smashing, decision to continue). The closing image is haunting but lacks a final emotional punch to elevate it.</comment>
