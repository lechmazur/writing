<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters intriguing but sketchy; Elias's cynicism is well-worn but lacks layered nuance; antagonist's menace is vivid but archetypal; motivations implied through subtext rather than demonstrated through complex action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pottery class encounter drives the plot efficiently; cause/effect between dialogue and invitation clear; pacing brisk yet cohesive within tight structure; lacks resolution but ends purposefully on unsettling tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard and colonial rooftops evoke rich, specific atmosphere; sensory details like humid air, clay scent, and predatory bird gloves immerse readers; setting mirrors thematic tensions between tradition and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (lock-picking as political scheming, pottery as manipulation) deepen subtext; dialogue layered with menace; ending lingers as ambiguity between danger and rebirth of fascination; show-don't-tell upheld.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (rooftop orchard original), though antagonist verges on gothic femme fatale; prose occasionally ornate but mostly precise; emotional resonance implied through atmosphere rather than explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like gloves and throne deepen plot; some (thrive as setting) feel ornamental; tone/style consistent; brevity serves tension; thematic coherence between hunting preservation and political power is sharp.</comment>
