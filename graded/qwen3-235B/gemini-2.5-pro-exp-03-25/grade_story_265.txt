<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Deputy's impassive nature serves as vague shorthand rather than deep characterization; motivation for seeking "grace" remains abstract without convincing emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stylized ritual replaces plot; tension dissipates through static observation rather than narrative progression; circular structure (arrival-departure) feels perfunctory rather than meaningful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in cathedral decay and orchard surrealism; however, the oil-stained deputy's presence feels conceptually disjointed from the sacred setting's ethereal qualities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (falling blossoms as snow, bees as sonic weavers) create lingering resonance, but thematic coherence wavers between spiritual quest and ecological allegory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking original premise undercut by occasional ornate abstraction ("sonic tapestries"); bee communication methodology strains credulity despite atmospheric execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unsettling beauty and symbolic density compensate for fragmented cohesion; the "moment of grace" conclusion feels predetermined rather than organically earned.</comment>
