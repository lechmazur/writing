<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knight's hopeful naivety drives both his actions and the resolution, but his emotional depth remains surface-level despite pivotal internal struggles hinted through sensory engagement with the jigsaw piece.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act progression within constraints balances mystery, confrontation, and catharsis. Pacing tightens tension effectively until the Machine's silence, though the labyrinth escape feels abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Phantom blossoms, weeping brass, and flickering symbology create a hauntingly cohesive dreamscape where decay and hope coexist materially, making abstract sorrow tangible through decaying/flickering sensory motifs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (fruit as trapped memory) and symbolic resonance (fragments recontextualized) elevate the text. The bittersweet catharsis subverts triumph-over-evil tropes by emphasizing shared human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Richly specific imagery avoids fantasy clich√©s, though "agonizing bliss" risks abstraction. The Machine's unique mechanism (syncing frequencies rather than fighting) shows ingenuity without feeling algorithmically generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements serve purposeful symbolic/emotional roles rather than checklist inclusion. The ending lingers with dual ambiguity about what "freedom" means for released memories.</comment>
