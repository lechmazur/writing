<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivation lacks full emotional grounding; the connection between insomnia and obsession with non-violence through plants remains underexplored despite aligned actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on atmospheric tension rather than tight structure; the throughline of whispered warnings driving action is effective, but the abbreviated resolution feels underdeveloped despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere flawlessly integrates sensory details and symbolic decay; attic’s "meticulously messy" state and subway liminality enhance psychological and supernatural stakes without redundancy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "lancing a wound") and thematic exploration of non-violence through confronting inner/outer hauntings resonate; ending’s ambiguity sustains tension without sacrificing thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in tying botanical harm to spectral accountability avoids cliché; introspective tone and idiosyncratic methods (drunken confessions) feel human-voiced, avoiding formulaic descriptors or predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole despite density; brevity amplifies haunting introspection rather than constraining it; thematic linger (e.g., "ancient echo") justifies concise form.</comment>
