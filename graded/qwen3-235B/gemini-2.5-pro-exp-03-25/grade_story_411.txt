<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character traits are purely conceptual; Spark's abstract nature prevents conventional development. Motivation exists as thematic idea but lacks human nuance or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Static loop of gathering fragments creates thematic coherence but fails to form traditional plot structure. No arc or transformation evident despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Richly textured with cosmic imagery. Sensory details (pulsing fruits, star-river) create immersive atmosphere. Each element intricately woven to evoke existential scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</comment><comment>Striking metaphors (shards as confessions, infinity-ocean time) but emotional impact diluted by abstraction. Subtext about silent humanity resonates, though distanced by poetic detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original metaphysical framework avoids clich√© while indulging in ornate phrasing. Balances fresh imagery (nebulae river) with occasional overwrought descriptors ("incandescent secret love").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Exquisite setting sacrificed to poetic concept. Elements serve atmosphere over narrative momentum. Leaves lingering philosophical questions but lacks story urgency.</comment>
