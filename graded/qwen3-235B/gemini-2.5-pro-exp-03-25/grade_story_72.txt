<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is focused but underdevelops its arc; cause-and-effect is logical but resolution feels abrupt, leaving thematic threads unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details, though some atmospheric elements lack narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext elevates the story, with a memorable tone and emotionally resonant themes of ambition and futility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant prose avoids clich√©s and purple prose, but the narrative structure leans on familiar existential tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story prioritizes mood over narrative impact; the brief length serves atmosphere but constrains character/plot resolution.</comment>
