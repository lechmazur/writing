<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (decoding symbols) drives action but lacks deeper psychological exploration; "scapegoat" role is utilitarian rather than emotionally resonant. Reactions to the washer suggest buried trauma but remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows tight procedural logic but lacks emotional/structural resolution. Cause/effect for symbol discovery is thin, narrative flow disrupted by abrupt ending. Pacing prioritizes mystery over character closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes cyberpunk-meets-archaeology intrigue, but setting details (ozone, silverite) remain decorative rather than thematically embedded. Timeframe's significance to "obsessive calm" is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (washer as paradox, narrative-as-refashioning) elevates plot, but emotional impact diluted by clinical prose. Subtext about erasure/recovery is clear but lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on genre tropes (mysterious calls, hidden truths) without sufficient subversion. Some phrases ("secret pulse beneath the facade") verge on formulaic noir cadence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack organic integration—scapegoat role feels imposed rather than intrinsic. Tone remains consistent, but brevity exposes underdeveloped themes. Premise intrigues but requires expansion for true resonance.</comment>
