<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but underexplored; her transformation feels abrupt. The empty purse as a symbolic object lacks psychological depth despite its thematic relevance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The labyrinth method drives the plot effectively with logical cause/effect. Pacing is controlled but slightly rushed during the climax despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant sensory details (dust, shimmering images) create immersive atmosphere. The fractured golden age tone harmonizes perfectly with both setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth-as-confession metaphor adds subtext. Ending has thematic purpose but lacks emotional gut-punch. Central theme of hidden costs of progress is clear but not fully nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with labyrinth revelation twist. No purple prose but occasionally over-relies on abstract descriptors ("fractured beauty") rather than concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole. Brief form feels intentional with meaningful compression. Lingering philosophical questions elevate beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
