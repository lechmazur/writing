<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's rebellious motivation is clear but slightly under-explored in emotional depth; interactions with objects reveal purpose but lack layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is imaginative but compressed; pivotal moments (e.g., mask transformation) feel slightly rushed, disrupting narrative rhythm.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere and sensory details (dust motes, resonant hums) immerse readers; the giant's bookshelf setting is evocatively tied to thematic concepts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (library-as-labyrinth, obituaries-as-blueprints) and a resonant theme of creation vs. observation elevate the story; emotional impact is potent but not fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise avoids clichés; prose balances lyricism and clarity, though a few phrases verge on overwrought. Integration of rebellion and magic feels inventive, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively weaves elements into a thematic whole, though a few components (e.g., revolution context) feel less integral. Leaves a lingering impression of art’s transformative power.</comment>
