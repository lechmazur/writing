<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is driven by clear motivation but lacks psychological depth; "brash" and "wild" traits are superficially shown through action without deeper exploration of inner conflict or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc within constraints, but the resolution feels rushed; the nautilus mechanism's logic is clever but underexplained, slightly weakening causal clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly textured (fluorescent decay, dust motes as "frantic ghosts") but underutilizes the discount store's potential for thematic dissonance between consumer detritus and preservationist endeavor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (dust as memory, spiral as salvation) are effective but occasionally heavy-handed; emotional impact is undercut by overly explicit "warmth of reciprocity" exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing esoteric elements (nautilus math, forgotten games) without clich√©, though the "dust particle chamber" description borders on unnecessary ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly into a thematic whole but lack expansiveness; the brevity works structurally but leaves the central metaphor ("detonation as preservation") underexplored.</comment>
