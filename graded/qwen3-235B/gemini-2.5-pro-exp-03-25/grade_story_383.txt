<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>General Thorne's burnout is vividly internalized but his transformation feels abrupt; motivation to dethrone fear is clear but lacks deeper layers of personal history to ground his resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tightly paced plot with a clear emotional arc from exhaustion to renewal; the use of photographs as a catalyst is logical within the setting's surreal logic, though the shift could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Dark Matter Diner's twilight atmosphere and sensory details (e.g., "fossilized dread," "collective sigh") masterfully evoke existential unease, enriching both character and concept through immersive, cohesive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "trajectories around obstacles") and the juxtaposition of fear/resilience create profound thematic resonance; the ending subtly redefines courage as persistence, avoiding didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids artificiality; the blend of cosmic metaphors ("singularity") and intimate human struggles feels purposeful. Dialogue avoids clich√©, but some phrases ("tyranny of fear's logic") lean on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize to explore resilience as nonlinear struggle; the brevity enhances focus on thematic urgency, leaving a lingering meditation on fear's coexistence with purpose.</comment>
