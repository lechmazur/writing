<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is defined by tortured protector trait but lacks psychological depth; motivations are implied but not fully explored; reliance on internal monologue weakens voice distinctness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression toward confrontation works within word limit but relies on expositional backstory; cause/effect clarity wavers during cosmic alignment explanation; ending feels abrupt yet thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting details create immersive decay; sensory elements (dust, ozone, light) enhance mood; atmosphere aligns with cosmic horror undertones but circus symbolism remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (crack as galaxy, lullaby/abyss contrast) elevate; emotional impact diluted by occasional over-explanation; open-ended cosmic reveal sparks reflection but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity but leans on cosmic horror tropes; dollâ€™s "suspicious sweetness" subverts expectations moderately; prose occasionally veers into self-conscious lyricism; psychological nuance feels algorithmically approximated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion but uneven integration of assigned elements; some components (planetarium backstory, circus specifics) feel external; premise carries potential but execution lacks singular visionary force.</comment>
