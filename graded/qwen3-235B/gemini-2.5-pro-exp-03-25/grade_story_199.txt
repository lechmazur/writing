<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's obsession drives the narrative, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Actions align with motivation but lack nuanced inner conflict. Voice is distinct in its single-mindedness but limited beyond that.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc to the Nexus discovery, but pacing feels slightly compressed. Cause-effect logic holds, though the word limit leaves some narrative threads underdeveloped (e.g., the goddess's nature).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in the urban orchard setting. The contrast of bioluminescent life against decaying concrete enhances the theme. The "familiarly unknown" tone permeates every detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ending delivers a quiet revelation that rewards close reading. Subtext about connection to place and transcending obsession resonates. Moments of poetic imagery elevate craft, though emotional payoff stays understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre formulae with its post-human ecological mysticism. Some phrases lean toward ornate description, but metaphors like "air tasting of ozone and plums" maintain freshness. Concept coherence saves from pure lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements synergize to explore a singular theme despite contrivances. Length feels purposeful, building mystery without overexplaining. Lingering questions about the goddess's nature suggest deliberate thematic ambiguity.</comment>
