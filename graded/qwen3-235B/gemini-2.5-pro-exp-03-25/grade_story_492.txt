<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but lack depth; motivation is clear but underexplored emotionally. Actions align with traits but feel surface-level, failing to reveal true complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has coherent progression but lacks strong arc or resolution. Setup and method are clear, but the ending feels abrupt, leaving narrative tension unresolved within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (neon, sparks, static), but some elements like interconnected trails are underdeveloped, slightly diluting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and imagery (e.g., "hammer shattered light") but underdeveloped themes limit emotional resonance. Conflict is present but lacks layered subtext or lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise with anachronistic tools, but occasionally leans on familiar "digital ghosts" tropes and slightly inconsistent tone shifts. Avoids overt clichés but lacks full subversion of genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements fit cohesively but feel constrained by brevity. The story’s arc is serviceable yet leaves concepts underexplored. Promising premise but lacks the refined depth needed for flagship publication.</comment>
