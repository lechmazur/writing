<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is present but lacks sufficient grounding in concrete actions or clear psychological development. The juxtaposition of diplomacy and philosophical curiosity feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative structure shows thematic progression through epiphany, but plot progression relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than concrete cause-and-effect relationships within the word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere. The eerie salt mine setting and twilight bus journeys combine with melancholic tone masterfully, though connection to the computer key remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors about bird murmuration and village dynamics create meaningful resonance. Quiet emotional undercurrents and philosophical musings engage intellectually, though payoff feels slightly diffuse rather than sharply impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in combining evolutionary philosophy with political negotiation avoids overt clich√©s. Some purple prose tendencies (excessive musicality in descriptions) and underdeveloped symbolic elements (computer key) prevent maximum originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story successfully weaves multiple elements into thematically cohesive whole. The brevity works for contemplative tone, but certain narrative threads (key's significance, villagers' specific history) feel under-realized in this compressed format.</comment>
