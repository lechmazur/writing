<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s skepticism and archival motivation are well-defined but underexplored; her internal conflict between rationality and symbolic acts feels hinted at but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure relies on procedural repetition rather than narrative progression; lacks a clear arc or resolution, but the cyclical act of categorization provides minimal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere through juxtaposition of sterile star charts and tactile thimbles; sensory details (holographic glow, metallic hums) deepen the melancholic, post-human setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes existential reflection via metaphor and subtext; writing is lyrical but occasionally overwrought. Tension lies in futility vs. preservation, though emotional resonance remains restrained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh concept with minimal clichés; avoids heavy tropes. Some phrasing (e.g., “loud silence”) risks abstraction, but the blend of technology and organic loss feels inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive integration across elements; brevity serves the contemplative tone. Leaves an impression of quiet defiance against erasure, though stakes remain abstract.</comment>
