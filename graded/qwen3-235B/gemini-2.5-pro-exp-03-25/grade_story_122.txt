<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's cyber-templar identity and internal conflict are present but lack depth; motivations are hinted at but underdeveloped, relying on abstract concepts rather than embodied experience. Actions align with desire for control, but personality remains elusive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has logical progression from ritual preparation to catastrophic climax, but the 500-word limit strains the arc's emotional weight; cause-effect clarity exists but feels rushed in pivotal moments like the lightning strike's execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral, haunting atmosphere created through tactile details (whipping flags, texture of bridle) and sensory contrasts (storm vs. crumbling relics); setting feels mythic yet grounded, amplifying thematic tension between technology and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolism (prism as hubris, bridle as primal tether) elevate the narrative; the ending's visceral impact and layered subtext about control vs. surrender resonate, though dialogue/voice aren't tested.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by blending techno-spiritual motifs; sensory details and metaphors feel specific, not generic. Avoids purple prose by grounding abstractions (euphoric agitation) in physicality. Emotional nuance emerges through objects, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense cohesion achieved despite multiple elements; most details serve theme or character. Style balances lyricism and precision. Emotional resonance is thin compared to intellectual impact, leaving less lingering aftertaste.</comment>
