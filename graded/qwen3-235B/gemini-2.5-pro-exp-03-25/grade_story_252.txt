<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks nuanced inner conflict development; penitent thief voice is present but underexplored through limited introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has atmospheric momentum but lacks structural resolution; drifting petals as data points create motion without escalating tension or clear arc progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional textural immersion with contradictory cold/retained warmth; crystallized breath vs. spectral sweetness creates visceral cognitive dissonance that mirrors thematic fractures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (swing set slowing, resonating crystals) elegantly echo existential entropy; emotional impact diluted by excessive lyricism obscuring human stakes beneath cosmic repair.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unusual combinations (e.g., toy blocks + dimension rifts), but occasionally lapses into ornate abstractions ("sensory details trapped in amber") that distance reader from visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Element integration demonstrates thematic synergy rather than checklist-driven inclusion, though the brevity sacrifices narrative complexity needed for full emotional payoff.</comment>
