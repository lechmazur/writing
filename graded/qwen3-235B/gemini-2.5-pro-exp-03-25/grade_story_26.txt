<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation drives action clearly, but backstory remains underdeveloped, weakening consistency. Emotional release feels earned but insufficiently layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through experimental action, but the compressed arc lacks nuanced progression between obsession and vindication. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid sensory contrasts (bioluminescence vs. grime) and integrated cyberpunk motifs. The setting’s energy actively shapes the protagonist’s desperation and the experiment’s stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotive imagery ("coded language of biology") and layered symbolism create strong impact. The final tear risks sentimentality but is balanced by restrained subtext about shame’s dissolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambition for originality shines in DNA-as-nexus concept, but certain tropes (lone genius, tortured inventor) undermine uniqueness. Language occasionally veers toward poetic excess without sufficient narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>ELEMENTS (7A-J) feel organically intertwined with the narrative arc. The constrained format amplifies tension rather than limits it, though some emotional depth is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
