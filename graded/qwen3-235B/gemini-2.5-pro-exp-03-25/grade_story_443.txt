<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prominent voice and clear motivation anchor Azrael’s arc, but interiority occasionally flattens beneath poetic abstraction. The novel draft’s role in illuminating his emotional evolution is effective, though some reactions (e.g., sudden "fearful joy") could benefit from more textured nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Modest yet resonant arc from sorrow to tentative hope; seeds and springs as recurring motifs anchor the plot. Pacing within word constraints feels deliberate but occasionally rushed when resolving tonal shifts. Cause/effect between discovery and transformation remains cohesive but understated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and purposeful—the cavern’s echo, the seed-glow, and decaying scrolls evoke melancholy and reverence. Sensory details (e.g., “brittle paper and dust”) deepen the forgotten library’s melancholic wonder, harmonizing with Azrael’s internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of growth amid grief resonate through layered metaphors (springs, seeds, revisions). Subtext is strong, but some phrasing risks over-literalness (e.g., labeling the library as a “repository of transitions”). Ending balances hope and lingering shadow effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, though bird seeds as guides border on whimsy. Emotional resonance often shows rather than tells, but isolated phrases (“quiet roar of becoming”) risk purple prose. Style is distinctive but occasionally strains under ornate phrasing, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around Azrael’s pilgrimage, though seeds and springs could feel more symbiotic. The concise form amplifies introspective focus, leaving a lingering impression of quiet metamorphosis. Some joints between concepts (e.g., bird migration’s thematic weight) feel underdeveloped.</comment>
