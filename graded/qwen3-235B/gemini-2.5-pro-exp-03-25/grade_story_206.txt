<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Main motivation shift lacks emotional depth and feels rushed, undermining character transformation. Initial vendetta and subsequent revelations lack nuanced psychological progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraint, but transitions between key revelations (mother's identity, map deception) rely on narrative convenience rather than organic causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes decay through sparse details (rain-slicked cobblestones, hollow clock tower), but fails to fully integrate setting with emotional or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (sugar as brittle spite, dissolving maps) shows promise, but emotional impact diluted by compressed pacing that undercuts thematic exploration of memory and betrayal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in candy-sculptor profession and photographic trail, but contains overly ornate phrasing ("pulsed with ardent scorn") and insufficiently subverts revenge-to-redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements structurally coherent but emotionally underdeveloped; brief length exposes forced transitions rather than leveraging constraint for narrative intensity.</comment>
