<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's priesthood and confusion are stated but underdeveloped; deeper psychological exploration of his spiritual collapse would strengthen motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacks conventional structure but creates momentum through lyrical abstraction; the jogging action loops rather than builds, leaving an impression rather than arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details merge surreal setting with emotional state; the beanstalks-as-gods metaphor and snow patterns as existential guides create cohesive, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (abacus/sins, snow-as-path, silence-as-damnation) elevates beyond prose; ending deliberately ambiguous but thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific metaphors and psychological nuance, but some phrases ("weary pearl," "quiet damnation") border on overly-poetic abstraction rather than revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>All elements interwoven thematically rather than mechanically; the brevity enhances existential tension; concept risks overshadowing emotional immediacy but achieves lyrical coherence.</comment>
