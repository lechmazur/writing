<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Restlessness is shown through actions, but the tailor aspect remains secondary to plot rather than defining his identity or methodology. Motivation is clear but lacks deep psychological nuance. The lantern interaction reveals resolve but not inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Well-structured three-act arc compressed for word limit, but the climax feels abrupt rather than earned. The method of spreading dissent is clever yet under-explained. Pacing is efficient but occasionally thin on cause-effect connections between key events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bio-dome claustrophobia and Martian exterior contrast effectively. Sensory details (kerosene scent, plasti-steel texture) immerse readers, but the "bookshop mysteries" subplot remains underutilized in building atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern's symbolism and ledgers-as-rebels make clever literary use of objects. Ending provides emotional resonance but sacrifices narrative complexity. Central theme of manufactured scarcity vs. hope emerges clearly but without philosophical depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt sci-fi clich√©s through unique protagonist and methods, but "rebel vs. dystopian council" framework feels familiar. Language balances clarity and poeticism; some descriptors ("whispered secrets", "forgotten lantern") verge on convention but serve atmosphere effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story integrates most elements cohesively, though bookshop mysteries feel optional rather than essential. Stylistic concision suits short form but leaves emotional subtext mostly implied. Ending lingers but lacks surprising thematic reverberations.</comment>
