<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Tension between Elias' insecurity and his reckless pursuit of validation is compelling, yet motivation feels thinly sketched—more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on atmospheric tension and symbolic discovery, but lacks a clear arc; the ending feels abrupt, undercutting potential thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Futuristic decay, sensory details (ozone, flickering light), and contrast between sterile HQ and decaying Sector Gamma create a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</comment>Symbolism (echoes, duplication) and unresolved questions provoke thought, but emotional resonance is undercut by detachment; the ending trades closure for thematic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptions ("fractured idyll," "simmering future") border on self-parody; concept leans on sci-fi clichés without subversion; tone feels consciously "literary" rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but the story’s brevity sacrifices meaningful synthesis; atmosphere outshines narrative depth, leaving ideas underexplored.</comment>
