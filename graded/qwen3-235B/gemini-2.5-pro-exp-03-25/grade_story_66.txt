<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but some internal shifts feel abrupt; the transition from preservation to destruction lacks nuanced psychological scaffolding despite strong thematic alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and symbolically cohesive, though the inciting catalyst for the final action relies slightly on underexplored temporal shifts within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details like porcelain fractures and bio-electric hums; setting functions as active participant rather than backdrop, creating visceral immersion through layered sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (masks as cyclical trauma, plant bio-signatures as emotional landscapes) elevates beyond surface narrative; ending achieves thematic and symbolic closure without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptual fusion of plant sentience and archaeological reconstruction; occasional phrasing ("whispering flora") risks artifice but is redeemed by sustained allegorical precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements interrelate with intentional precision; brevity enhances existential resonance; final image of ash and green hum lingers as existential epiphany rather than narrative limitation.</comment>
