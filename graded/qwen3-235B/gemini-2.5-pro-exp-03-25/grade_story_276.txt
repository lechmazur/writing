<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's unease and intellectual curiosity are consistent motivators. His fascination with patterns and reactive growth through mundane objects feel plausible, but deeper emotional layers remain underdeveloped despite effective gestures toward existential transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tightly paced with clear progression from alienation to epiphany. The coathanger incident efficiently catalyzes thematic resolution. Time constraints occasionally flatten tension, but structural unity between debris tracking and personal revelation holds firm.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orbital station's sterile artificiality contrasts poignantly with humanizing artifacts (synthetic grass, nostalgic postcards). Sensory details (grease-on-metal gestures, clattering hanger) ground abstraction in physical reality. Atmosphere masterfully reinforces cosmic isolation and fragile hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (space debris as life trajectories, mangled hanger as redemption vessel) avoid pat sentimentality. Dialogue serves thematic counterpoint rather than exposition. Ending balances closure with lingering philosophical resonance about impermanence and reinvention.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through paradoxical setting (high-tech station with makeshift traditions). Some phrasing ("nascent hope") risks preciousness, but overall maintains tonal consistency. Emotional beats are subtly shown rather than stated, resisting algorithmic predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively: picnics humanize orbital isolation, the bent hanger literalizes thematic throughlines. Brief length leverages concentration of meaning rather than limiting scope. Leaves contemplative resonance about finding order in chaos.</comment>
