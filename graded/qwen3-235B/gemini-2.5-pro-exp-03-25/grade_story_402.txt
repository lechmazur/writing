<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character defined by ritualistic archiving motivation, but lacks psychological depth beyond symbolic role as solitary observer; gestures hint at inner conflict but remain cryptic rather than fully developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Raft-journey structure allows cyclical momentum within constraints, though pivotal sign-language moment disrupts pacing slightly; clear cohesion between departure and existential questions at conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gothic catacomb atmosphere masterfully rendered—sensory details (petrified fruit, spectral light) create immersive decay; setting functions as active character reflecting protagonist's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (empty bottle as existential question) and haunting imagery elevate thematic resonance; ending's 'luminous doubt' provokes reflection but risks abstract detachment from emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through unique baron-survivalist twist, but stylistic flourishes occasionally verge on mannered; atmospheric details vivid yet occasionally overwhelming narrative drive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into existential tapestry, though brevity limits thematic payoff; tone of melancholic inquiry lingers despite minimal plot resolution.</comment>
