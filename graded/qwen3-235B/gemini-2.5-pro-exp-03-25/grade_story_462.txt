<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Minimal yet effective inner turmoil shown; lacks proactive character decisions or distinct voice but uses environmental interaction to imply psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Piecemeal structure focuses on internal shift via external stimuli; lacks traditional plot progression but achieves emotional arc within constraints through subtle transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive sensory immersion; decaying carnival setting and metallic sound create oppressive yet hopeful atmosphere that mirrors character's psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance (tapping as "seed," mirrors as potential) elevates; prose richly layered but occasionally risks overwrought introspection without narrative anchor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative details avoid clich√© but border on ornate; emotional subtext emerges through metaphor rather than formulaic expression, though some phrasing feels consciously literary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but slight bloat in descriptive density strains word limit; lingers emotionally but structural concision falters under weight of metaphor.</comment>
