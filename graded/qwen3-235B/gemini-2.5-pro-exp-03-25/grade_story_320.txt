<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's shyness remains superficially sketched; her "passionate disinterest" lacks nuance. Motivation through cosmic duty feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded, despite clear assignment adherence. Reactions to photographs hint at depth but remain cerebral rather than viscerally personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression (discovery → investigation → resolution), but compressed scale weakens emotional stakes. The precipitate action is conceptually sound yet rushed; critical juncture lacks visceral tension. Parallel timelines enrich plot but create coherence issues within strict word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Underwater setting rendered with vivid, tactile details (recycled air, brine) that enhance melancholy tone. Synthesis of drowned urban decay with digital ghosts is imaginative. Timeframe's integration feels uneven – parallel timelines are referenced more than felt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cosmic metaphors ("quantum foam," "scar tissue of sorrow") are striking but occasionally hollow. Subtext about regret's ripple effects is compelling yet underdeveloped. Ending feels conceptually tidy rather than emotionally resonant. Conflict remains intellectualized rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes; combines speculative elements in novel ways (social media as temporal map). Some phrases ("agonizing clarity") border on cliché abstraction. Character reasoning maintains internal logic but lacks erratic human complexity. Descriptors generally vivid but occasionally overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story hangs together conceptually, though length compresses emotional development. Elements serve theme but occasionally prioritize concept over character. Prose style is purposeful but inconsistent in tonal control. Ambitious attempt to condense metaphysical ideas into tight form yields intriguing questions but limited catharsis.</comment>
