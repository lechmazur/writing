<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters' motivations and voices are present but underdeveloped. Elara's rebellious sincerity is clear, but her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration. Kael functions as a plot device rather than a fully realized character. Dialogue is purposeful but sparse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc within constraints, with logical progression from resolve to discovery. Theorizing through shared secrets drives action effectively. Pacing is tense but occasionally compressed, with minor consistency slips (e.g., sudden passage disorientation needing more setup).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion: cold air, whispering drafts, resonant chime. The decaying Guildhall and haunted passage synergize with thematic decay and preservation. Atmosphere directly shapes character actions and tension, making the setting a narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evokes melancholy, suspense, and cautious hope through atmospheric details rather than explicit statements. Symbolic use of resonant stonework as "architectural memory." Ending balances resolution with lingering thematic implications about heritage vs. progress, avoiding sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original subversion of "haunted space" trope through architectural acoustics. Avoids overwrought metaphors but occasionally leans on familiar phrasing ("woven into stones"). Emotional nuance present but sometimes overshadowed by dense descriptive language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements reflects deliberate design. The brief form serves thematic urgency rather than feeling imposed. Ending lingers through suggestive implications about preservation in the face of inevitable change, elevated by strong atmospheric closure.</comment>
