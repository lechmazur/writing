<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character is consistently framed as a risk-taker with luck-as-identity, but motivations beyond "defying hopelessness" lack psychological depth. The shift from gambler to confronting psychic corruption feels plausible but underexplored. The "typically never gave a fig" trait connects to his later fascination with the diary, but this contrast isn't meaningfully interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Spin-the-bottle confessions" drive plot but strain credibility in causing psychic corruption. The schoolhouse's lingering game has clear visual logic but under-explained mechanics. The tight arc from diary discovery to confrontation is effective, though the transition to the gymnasium's tapping moment feels abrupt without deeper build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghost town decay permeates every image ("irradiated dust," "spectral children"), creating palpable atmosphere. The "unremembered future" timeframe enhances the haunting through temporal ambiguity. The botanical diary's tactile details contrast beautifully with apocalyptic decay, though the psychic energy's physical manifestation remains sketchily described.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor of "duplicate" as corrupt imitation of hope works conceptually but lacks visceral embodiment through action. The tone of cheerful despair is powerfully encapsulated in phrases like "perfect cocktail of cheerful despair" but rarely viscerally dramatized. The ending's thematic resonance about gambling with hope is strong but could benefit from more subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids generic haunted schoolhouse tropes through psychic mechanics and subversive metaphors ("irradiated ghosts of hope"). The "unremembered future" timeframe and gamified corruption of intimacy feel authentically strange. Some overwritten phrases ("tiny cheerful ghosts") border on cliché, but the central concept of confession-as-energy source has fresh, disturbing originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by brevity—element integration succeeds best in worldbuilding but feels rushed in conceptual execution (psychic contagion mechanics remain vague). The self-contained dilemma creates momentum, though the speculative framework's full implications remain underexplored. The unresolved ending lingers effectively but risks feeling unsatisfyingly provisional.</comment>
