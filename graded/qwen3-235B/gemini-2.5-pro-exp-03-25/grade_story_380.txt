<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; her status as a dream thief is intriguing but underexplored in terms of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is thematically coherent but feels compressed; the climactic surge of psychic energy lacks sufficient buildup for emotional impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting evokes haunting desolation through details like petrified branches and silence, though sensory immersion remains uneven beyond visual metaphors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("quiet mania clung like static") elevate the prose; the unresolved ending resonates thematically but risks ambiguity over intentionality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong conceptual foundation; execution falters slightly in balancing lyrical abstraction with concrete character/plot development within constraints.</comment>
