<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (documenting dialects) is clear, but inner conflicts remain superficial. Loyalty to "voices" drives actions but lacks psychological depth. Brewer profession ties poorly to core mission. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has coherent arc (poster discovery → revelation), but compressed pacing rushes resolution. Cause-effect (poster → map → journey) functions logically, though final transition feels abrupt. Word limit strains complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting: frozen machinery, olfactory contrast of malt/oil, tactile descriptions of brittle poster. Mechanical caravans' anachronism enhances eerie atmosphere. Tone of "faith" contrasts industrial harshness effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (pressure marks as maps) and metaphorical craftsmanship (preservation as rebellion against erasure) stand out. Theme of cultural preservation resonates, but emotional impact diluted by underdeveloped stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Straw method shows ingenuity; avoids overused "ancient map" tropes. Sensory details specific rather than boilerplate. Minimal purple prose, though some descriptions verge on excessive (e.g., "pressure marks scattered across aged paper").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interconnected elements function cohesively, though timeframe ("after wheel") feels arbitrarily imposed. Mechanical caravans add memorable texture rather than structural necessity. Ending suggests potential rather than realized depth.</comment>
