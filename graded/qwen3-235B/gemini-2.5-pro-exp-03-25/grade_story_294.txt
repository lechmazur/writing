<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterâ€™s motivation (preserving past self) is clear but underexplored; emotional weight implied but not deeply felt. "Dry tongue" metaphor ties to creative block but lacks visceral consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has unity and progression, but climax is underdeveloped; tension dissolves without resolution. Timeframe compression feels both effective (dreamlike focus) and limiting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi create hauntingly immersive atmosphere; sensory details (parchment tongue, pearlescent gills) amplify thematic resonance. Timeframe and setting fuse seamlessly with mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic lyricism (light-as-sound metaphor) elevates theme of fractured identity. Ending risks vagueness but gains potency through evocative imagery rather than explicit closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes; prism/voicemail concept is original but occasionally strained. Emotional nuance emerges through tactile details (trembling finger, mossy table) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion emerges through atmospheric precision, but some elements (awkwardness, voicemail method) feel contrived. Lingers thematically but risks ambiguity over impact.</comment>
