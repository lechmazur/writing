<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation (preserving dances) is clear but underdeveloped; his profession as a "nimble locksmith" isn't meaningfully integrated into actions or decisions, feeling more like a label than a defining trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has a visible arc (dancing to prevent leaf's fall) but pacing falters: critical backstory feels crammed into descriptions rather than unfolding naturally within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with rich sensory details; the driftwood orchard's physical/metaphysical duality creates haunting atmosphere that deeply supports the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolic resonance (dance as reality-shaping act) elevate the story; ending lacks emotional payoff, weakening the overall narrative impact despite lush prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept but lapses into ornate descriptions; some phrases ("liquid potential") feel contrived, and motivation exposition risks veering into "telling" rather than "showing."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story cohesively combines elements but strains under word constraints; the indigenous dances concept feels tacked on thematically rather than organically woven into the plot.</comment>
