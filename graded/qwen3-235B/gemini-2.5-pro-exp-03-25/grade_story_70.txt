<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elmsworth's rigid personality and meticulous motivation are clearly shown, but his transformation feels abrupt. His third-person narration lacks a distinctive voice, and the "arms of steel" empathy motivation is underdeveloped despite shaping his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The adhesive analysis method drives the plot logically toward the revelation, but the rapid shift from scientific discovery to philosophical epiphany strains cohesion within the tight word limit. The beginning-to-end causality is clear but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The witch's greenhouse fused with gravestones creates visceral atmosphere, with sensory details like "cobwebs draped over wilting nightshade" reinforcing the death-and-life theme. The setting meaningfully frames both the object’s mystery and Elmsworth’s transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Imagery like "crudely complex filament" and "threads of science and superstition" enhances thematic depth, while the bellowing climax effectively "shows" emotional rupture. The ending’s wistful optimism resonates, though subtext about fluid truth remains underexplored.</grade>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of Tesla’s science with occult elements subverts genre tropes, avoiding cliché. Metaphors (e.g., "arms of steel") feel purposeful, not ornamental. Emotional nuance emerges through Elmsworth’s tactile interaction with objects rather than exposition, avoiding formulaic AI writing patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Despite tight constraints, the story balances multiple assigned elements cohesively. The brief length serves as a focused vignette, but some thematic threads (like "cradling empathy") feel underdone. The Tesla bulb’s implications linger thoughtfully.</comment>
