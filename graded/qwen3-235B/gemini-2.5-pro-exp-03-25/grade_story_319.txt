<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's frailty contrasts with decisive escape plan, effectively revealing inner conflict. Motivation clarified through phial's role, but lacks complex psychological layers beyond immediate dilemma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight cause-effect chain from carved messages to escape attempt. Pacing manages to create closure within word limit, though sorting ritual's mechanics remain underexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tidal island's physical constraints mirror emotional entrapment. Vivid salt spray, mist, and pre-dawn light create oppressive beauty. Atmosphere flawlessly supports thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "painted allegiances" and "temporary slumber" deepen themes. Ending's ambiguity invites reflection on freedom's cost. Subtext about societal performance elevates narrative.</comment>
