<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations (Syndicate acceptance to fill Elara's void) are clear but could use more nuance. His rationally emotional aspect is shown but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear sequence but feels rushed in execution. Dramatized entrance works but connections between setup and aftermath lack depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted atmosphere achieved through sensory details (smell of decay, creaking structures), but tonal shifts between jubilant despair feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphor use (clover symbolism) and layered emotional subtext work well, though ending lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most purple prose but occasionally uses expected tropes (haunted amusement parks) without subverting them. Emotional complexity prevents full formulaic condemnation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Despite solid core elements, coherence suffers from uneven character exploration and underdeveloped thematic resolution within the confined word limit.</comment>
