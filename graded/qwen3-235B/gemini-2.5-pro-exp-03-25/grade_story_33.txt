<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Static character embodiment of abstract concepts lacks human depth or internal conflict; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through believable choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Circular structure lacks narrative progression; atmospheric shifts replace plot but fail to create emotional stakes or clear resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details create an oppressive yet fragile environment, but the sterile office's symbolic function overshadows its practical existence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich in metaphorical resonance (entropy vs order) but uneven emotional engagement; some passages feel like philosophical lecture rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Premise is original but execution leans on abstract paradoxes and ornate descriptors; feels consciously "literary" rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptually bold but emotionally distant; elements cohere intellectually but lack visceral urgency that would make avant-garde abstraction compelling.</comment>
