<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; the sudden shift from aimlessness to purpose feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally earned. Internal conflict remains superficial despite the imaginative concept.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story’s tight arc is well-structured, but the leap from observing hopscotch to decoding a cipher strains plausibility. Pacing is mostly controlled, though key emotional beats could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with sensory details (dust motes, melted snowflake) masterfully anchoring the reader in a melancholic, timeless space that mirrors the narrative’s themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism elevates the story—floral cipher, melting snowflake as ephemeral discovery. Subtext about cultural erasure and reconstruction is poignant. Ending resonates but lacks a minor narrative punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on formal phrasing ("profound hush") and overwrought descriptors ("mournful elation"). The seed/vigilance metaphor is fresh, though its connection to the recipes feels under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates elements but occasionally feels constrained by its ambition. Themes linger in the mind, yet some plot mechanics (cipher logic) demand more grounding to fully satisfy.</comment>
