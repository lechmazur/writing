<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Background as blacksmith remains superficial, meekness inconsistently balanced against active pursuit of bargain; motivation is clear but psychological complexity underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed but functional; ignition climax connects to opening, but verification process lacks detailed mechanics; pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over plot clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Underwater setting masterfully rendered through specific sensory details (bubbles, silt, waterlogged documents) that amplify emotional decay; timeframe's existential entropy permeates atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (grief as fuel, dictionaries as crucibles) resonate; ending achieves transformational catharsis through poetic compression; subtext about collective human pain emerges organically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic structures; "heartbreak verification system" and drowned bureaucracy show ingenuity; occasionally overwritten descriptions (e.g., "luminous regret") border on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around elegiac theme; concision serves melancholic tone; ending lingers through metaphor rather than explicit resolution; feels deliberately distilled rather than truncated.</comment>
