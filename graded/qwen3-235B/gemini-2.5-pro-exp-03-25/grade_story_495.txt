<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is clear but lacks deeper psychological nuance; motivation is consistent but underdeveloped beyond surface-level yearning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels compressed in key transitions; escapes-to-illustrations-to-revelation progression lacks emotional weight anchoring the transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vividly imagined setting with strong gear/cage metaphors, but underutilizes sensory details beyond visual elements to fully immerse readers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in postcards and paddle, but emotional impact is diluted by overly abstract "joyful sorrow" without concrete grounding in character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise with rich potential, but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing that distracts from narrative urgency; avoidance of clich√©s is mostly successful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically coherent whole, though the brevity weakens the sense of a complete arc; raises intriguing ideas without fully resolving them.</comment>
