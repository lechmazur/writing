<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character shifts from bravado to calculation without sufficient internal complexity; motivations are clear but lack nuance beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eavesdropping effectively drives the plot, but the condensed arc feels hurried; connections between clues and resolution are logical but underdeveloped due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but inconsistent; chitinous walls and popping balloons create unease, yet the wasp-nest setting’s biological logic clashes with the simulation theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lingering imagery (e.g., lint as reality anchor) and layered metaphors elevate the narrative, though some emotional beats rely on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Concept avoids total cliché but leans on simulation tropes; language balances evocative and ornate, with occasional lapses into overly abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds in weaving elements into a cohesive whole but struggles with thematic depth; the ending hints at resolution without full emotional resonance.</comment>
