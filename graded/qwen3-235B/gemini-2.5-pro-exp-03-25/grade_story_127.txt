<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits (street performer facade, guilt over Thorne), but emotional beats about atonement rely more on exposition than nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves a tight arc through tactile memory trigger, though the causal link between coral texture and security code strains plausibility despite genre conventions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (machine oil, luminescent coral) create a vivid, contradictory steampunk atmosphere that meaningfully contrasts mechanical precision with organic imperfection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses tactile imagery effectively to externalize inner turmoil. Subtext about reconciling past and present is thematically coherent, but conclusion lacks emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by weaving biological elements into steampunk tropes. Memory retrieval via texture feels inventive rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Story maintains cohesion despite multiple assigned elements, though some feel like puzzle pieces forced into place rather than organically connected.</comment>
