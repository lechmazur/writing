<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s zealotry manifests primarily through stated focus and repetitive gestures rather than nuanced behavior, leaving her motivation for seeking “sacrifice” psychologically underexplored despite clear intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A single static scene dominates; progression from setup to revelation lacks tangible stakes or consequences, though the conceptual arc between legacy and understanding is thematically coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (whirring machines, brittle bills) ground the atmosphere, but some elements (shifting powers outside) remain atmospheric backdrop rather than narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like “paper cuts of the soul” and layered imagery evoke profound emotional decay; the ending’s sorrowful revelation avoids sentimentality, resonating thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of science (attractor device) and emotional residue avoids cliché; prose occasionally teeters toward ornateness but mostly achieves vivid, purposeful specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, but the story’s weight hinges on abstract themes (legacy, sacrifice) that feel intellectually explored rather than viscerally embodied.</comment>
