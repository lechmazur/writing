<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalent prophet persona is established but lacks depth; her "happily sad" motivation feels more like aesthetic than fully realized psychology. Actions align with her assigned traits but lack complexity in how desire to "scramble" fate manifests.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causality loops tightly connect actions to consequences, but the jigsaw method feels under-explained. Achieves circularity within constraints, though some plot mechanics (marble splitting) border on mystical hand-waving. Pacing lingers effectively on psychological beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lunar setting establishes isolation through sterile sensory details (dust patterns, low gravity), but the colony feels more like atmosphere prop than integrated worldbuilding. Marbles as "tiny worlds" create symbolic synergy, while "starlight whispers" stretch plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose ("cosmic scoreboard," "defragment predetermined path") creates intellectual resonance. Ending satisfies by leaving future rebellion intact while showing tangible consequence (flickering scoreboard). Theme of chaotic agency vs deterministic systems remains emotionally cool but conceptually rich.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction ("violation of dawn's oath"). Some sensory details feel generic (static "within structure of possibility"), but the fusion of banal jigsaw edges with cosmic stakes shows inventiveness. Emotional palette stays cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compelling philosophical tension emerges organically rather than feeling imposed by assignment. Lunar setting and puzzle method create pleasing paradox of microscopic actions producing cosmic ripple effects. Falls short of transcendent synthesis but maintains conceptual rigor.</comment>
