<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to unify fragmented self is present but underdeveloped; "lost heiress" label feels tacked on rather than integrated into behavioral patterns or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear through-line from detour to experiment but feels compressed; resolution of initiating the resonance field lacks earned emotional payoff due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Superb sensory immersion with ozone tangs and warping air; reality-bleed atmosphere masterfully complements thematic fragmentation, though some descriptions verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of clouds mirroring psyche strikes effectively; ending creates urgency rather than closure. Thematic exploration of unification feels incipient rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through xenobiological context; "bitterly optimistic" framing is nuanced. Overly ornate phrases like "possibility until it screamed" teeter toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere remarkably well within word count, though execution prioritizes atmosphere over character depth. Final image lingers but lacks transformative weight.</comment>
