<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's manipulation and intellectual obsession are clear, but her internal conflict remains under-explored despite lucid confusion; motivations tied to ancient symbols feel abstract rather than grounded in tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tension escalates logically through psychological maneuvering, but the abrupt ending (unresolved rule-breaking) weakens closure; pacing balances introspection and action but strains coherence in 500 words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn hospital ward create a sterile, liminal atmosphere that mirrors Elara's mental state; rusted skates juxtapose decay against clinical order with visceral sensory details like corroded metal and fluorescents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (footprints, seeds) evoke fragility of hidden truths, but thematic depth wavers; emotional engagement lies in psychological tension rather than visceral stakes; subtext about knowledge preservation feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on "mysterious artifact" tropes; the skyscraper setting feels conceptually daring yet underutilized; some phrases ("digital surf") border on pretentious abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than interlock—skates/symbols are compelling, but "scattered seeds" and "receding footprints" strain cohesion; tone is distinctive but occasionally undermines narrative clarity.</comment>
