<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak integration of nomadic traits; motivation clear but underlayers of her past or psyche missing; dialogue demonstrates politeness as strategic mask but lacks distinctive voice; intervention reveals desperation but feels overly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Action (disabling the wheel) is clear and decisive, but setup feels compressed; concept (masked intentions) drives plot but some beats (rapid learning of routines) skimmed; pacing balances tension but sacrifices depth for brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Workshop atmosphere is richly textured with sensory detail (smell of petals, visual contrast of wheel against orchids); setting mirrors thematic duality (preservation vs. exploitation), but broader worldbuilding remains shallow.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism of the wheel as corrupted natural balance resonates; subtext of ecological harm via greed is potent; ending avoids closure, favoring bittersweet realism; prose balances lyricism and restraint to enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some clich√©s (secret societies, overtly sinister industrialists); sensory details (e.g., "cloying sweetness") occasionally generic; metaphors (frozen moments) effective but not groundbreaking; dialogue avoids stiffness but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively assembled but unevenly weighted; wheel and harmony theme anchor the narrative, while nomadic identity and coin toss feel perfunctory; brevity is leveraged but not transcended.</comment>
