<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Unit 734’s hive-mind therapist role is conceptually intriguing but lacks emotional depth. The motivation to "anchor the ephemeral" drives action, but the character remains more mechanism than living entity. The "uniformly peculiar" trainees are mentioned but unexplored beyond a superficial label.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot revolves around a single therapeutic session, achieving completeness within the word limit. The "slow drip of candle wax" method is logically integrated, and the cause-effect of draining psychic detritus feels coherent. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally static; the arc hinges on wax solidifying, which satisfies but doesn’t escalate tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sterile secret agent facility conflicts intriguingly with the beeswax/ozone chamber, enhancing the tone’s contrast. Sensory details (flame’s unwavering glow, scuffed plug) ground the surrealism. Atmosphere leans into "merry bitterness" effectively, but the "eve of discovery" timeframe isn’t fully leveraged to intensify stakes or setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of candle wax as crystallized regret is haunting. The story excels in imagery and symbolism, with "sound of hindsight" as a resonant subtext. The ending’s cyclical clearing of wax implies existential futility, prompting reflection. While impact is strong, the detached tone limits deeper emotional resonance, preventing a perfect score.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in the hive-mind therapist concept and wax-based catharsis. Avoids clichés, though "uniformly peculiar" feels underutilized. No overt purple prose, but some phrases ("psychic detritus they shed like skin") risk overwrought abstraction. The integration of "merry bitterness" is subtle but effective, avoiding formulaic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly, with the scuffed plug and wax method deeply tied to theme and character. The brief length feels intentional, focusing on a microcosm of psychological processing. The story lingers conceptually but sacrifices broader worldbuilding depth for intimacy, leaving a lingering, if not transformative, impression.</comment>
