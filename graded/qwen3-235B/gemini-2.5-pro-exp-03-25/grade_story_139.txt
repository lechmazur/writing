<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theron's monastic focus and vengeance motivation are clear but lack psychological depth; the "dark reflection" metaphor is hinted at but under-explored</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear gondola ascent provides structural clarity, but the tooth-mark analysis resolution feels expedited; logical connections between archival research and sudden recognition strain plausibility</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mountainous dawn setting masterfully intertwines sensory details (metallic groans, biting wind) with thematic tension; "cautious enchantment" permeates atmosphere through precise, restrained lyricism</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("tiny wounds on wood") and symbolic flute analysis elevate the narrative; the unresolved dream/plea adds haunting subtext, though emotional impact lacks gut-punch</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality in combining dental forensics with monastic quest avoids clich√©s, but overly formal descriptions like "jagged peaks clawed at a bruised sky" risk stylized detachment; maintains consistent tonal gravity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but not emotionally; the flute-tooth-mark-archived-label chain works logically but feels mechanically imposed rather than organically revealed</comment>
