<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the "secretive pathfinder" identity drives logistics more than psychology, with aloof passion manifesting as surface traits rather than integrated behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure moves logically but lacks tension; the ghost train visit serves as a modest emotional climax, but the circular training narrative limits narrative progression despite tight thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and resonant—decaying park, rain-slicked runs, dusty ghost train—but some sensory details verge on formulaic (e.g., "phantom smell of grease paint") without deepening emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emotional impact is effective but narrow; metaphors (e.g., teapot as fragile knowledge) and the solitary hug deliver poignant layers, but subtext about preservation vs. progress remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in playlist-hacking method, but risks cliché in combining "neglected genius" and "haunted urban decay"; emotional nuance is sometimes explicit rather than subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate well but unevenly; the teapot and medicinal mission feel essential, while the marathon framework and ghost train lean on genre conventions rather than fresh reinvention.</comment>
