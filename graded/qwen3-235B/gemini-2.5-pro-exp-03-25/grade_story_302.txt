<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's fierce nonchalance is vividly shown but could better align with chaos-taming; motivation to 'kiss madness' is clear but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Performance action tightly drives climax; pacing is brisk but coherent within constraints. Plot completeness suffers slightly from compressed tension resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steampunk setting merges flawlessly with thematic elements; sensory details like ozone scent and flickering gaslight masterfully enhance dissonant mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No clich√©s; fresh "static and broken glass" imagery subverts singing bard trope. Some descriptors ("gleamed brass," "sputtering indignation") border on ornate but generally serve atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively despite density; length amplifies tension's abrupt end rather than limiting it. Final line about twisting legends cleverly echoes opening legend reference.</comment>
