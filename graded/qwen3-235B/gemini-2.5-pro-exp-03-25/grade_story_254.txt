<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is symbolically rich but lacks dynamic development beyond existential resignation; motivations are clear yet minimally complicated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through cyclical structure, but pacing unevenly balances introspective loops with forward momentum in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are visceral, sensory anchors that amplify thematic dissonance between decay and cosmic futility; wilderness and playground vividly haunt the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (inkwell as ambition, starlight as unattainable meaning) resonate, but emotional impact remains cerebral over visceral; ending underscores theme but lacks gut-punch subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt trope subversion but infuses fresh life into existential artist tropes; poetic language occasionally veers into abstraction without losing human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements merge cohesively into melancholic whole; brief length emphasizes mood over plot, leaving thematic residue without feeling artificially constrained.</comment>
