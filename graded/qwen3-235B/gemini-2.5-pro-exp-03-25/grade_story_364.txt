<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's skewed visionary trait is present in actions and dialogue but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but not fully explored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive core action (connecting botanical sketches to hieroglyphs) drives the plot but the word limit flattens the arc; cause/effect is logical but pacing feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gritty sensory details (chemical smells, shimmering distortions) immerse readers; atmosphere masterfully contrasts sterile labs with ghostly trades, though the silent revolution’s impact is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (energy conduit as a weaver’s shuttle) and subtext about memory preservation are effective, but emotional impact is muted; ending feels thematically resonant yet emotionally detached.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some overly ornate phrases (“spectral glassblower shaping molten light”) border on purple prose; fresh concepts diluted by predictable emotional cues and lack of subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not innovatively combined; poignant moment crystallizes the theme, but the story’s brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of ideas.</comment>
