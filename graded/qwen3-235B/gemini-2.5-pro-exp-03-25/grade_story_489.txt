<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional complexity beyond the assigned duty; the ghostly voice is distinct yet underdevelops the 'aggressively kind' attribute in driving decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by the whale’s call and dancer’s timing is logical and cohesive; minor abruptness in connecting distant performance to core action slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through tactile details (salt, fog, dust) and eerie tone; setting and themes are seamlessly interwoven, enhancing the spectral guardian’s purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story uses symbolism (whale song, whistle flight) to evoke reflection on erasure of tradition; emotional resonance is overshadowed occasionally by abstract prose, diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in combining spectral stewardship and oceanic mysticism is strong, but recurring phrases like 'brazen calm' verge on aestheticized repetition; avoids major clichés but occasionally slips into poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements are cohesively deployed, though some (whale’s call) feel conceptually imposed; the brief length amplifies thematic focus but leaves subtext underexplored, occasionally privileging abstraction over clarity.</comment>
