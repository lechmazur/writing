<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "amicable" and scholarly traits influence his non-threatening approach to ghosts, but inner conflicts and motivations lack depth beyond stated academic curiosity. Subtlety in actions (pen tapping, crossword) barely scratches surface of psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ethereal resonance drives the story rather than plot mechanics. Pacing balances introspection and supernatural emergence, but lacks traditional arc â€“ resolution feels more like a suspension than a culmination within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral, layered sensory construction of haunted environment creates immersive tension between decay and purpose. Salt air, vibrating metal, and dancing dust motes fuse with thematic material to make the lighthouse itself a living character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "spectral static transmission" and dual isolation/connection theme create lingering resonance. Writing style shows remarkable control of poetic abstraction without sacrificing emotional texture, though some phrases verge on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While avoiding most genre defaults, the ship's bones as psychic receptors and "crossword as anchor" device contain a whiff of familiar tropes. Unique execution through precise atmospheric language elevates beyond predictability despite structural parallels to archetypal ghost stories.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements synthesize into cohesive mood piece where haunted history becomes tactile. The brief length enhances the crystalline focus on liminal space between living and dead, though broader thematic questions about knowledge preservation feel underserved by the contained scope.</comment>
