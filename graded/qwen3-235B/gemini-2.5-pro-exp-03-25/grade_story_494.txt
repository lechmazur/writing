<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is present but slightly rushed; Kaelen's arrogance and vulnerability coexist, but the shift from defiance to reluctant commitment lacks sufficient psychological nuance. His voice remains distinct, but motivations feel partially underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but occasionally abrupt. The inciting action (tapestry/authorization) drives the narrative, but key transitions (e.g., the mother’s song) feel slightly underweighted. Pacing is efficient for the word limit, though emotional beats could deepen.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant, with sensory details (ink, moss, coughing) anchoring the setting. However, the calligraphy courtyard’s symbolic link to Kaelen’s internal conflict could be more explicitly woven into the action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (clipped-wing bird, seal) and subtextual themes (tradition vs. individuality) elevate the narrative. The ending’s "defiant flower" metaphor delivers emotional impact, but some dialogue edges toward over-precision, slightly diluting rawness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes by subverting the "heroic legacy" arc—Kaelen acts without full conversion. Fresh metaphors (e.g., "harsh tenderness") and restrained prose enhance originality. Occasional abstract descriptors ("fragile continuation") slightly soften impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story coheres around tightly interwoven elements, but the brevity occasionally strains emotional depth. The abrupt ending feels deliberate but risks under-resonating. Themes linger, suggesting intentionality over limitation.</comment>
