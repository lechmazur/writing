<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Weakness in emotional depth for Aris; Silas's motives hinted but lack psychological complexity despite being tied to his "con" persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in middle; cause-effect clear but the reverse time mechanics lack explanation. Solid resolution but feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Incense/quantum lab contrast vivid; static snow visuals effective. Atmosphere supports thematic tension between cosmic forces and human (or con) fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphors ("chrono streams," "inevitable dawn") with layered subtext about truth/hope duality. Ending leaves lingering philosophical unease.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original glass lid usage avoids clich√©; some purple prose ("startled flamingo"). Emotional nuance exists but occasionally overshadowed by abstract metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements serve story; setting feels both specific and symbolic. Length works for conceptual punch, though Aris's arc remains underdeveloped.</comment>
