<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s exile and passion for butterflies are established but lack psychological depth; her actions align with her motivation but her inner life remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of setup, action, and quiet resolution, but pacing leans overly reliant on static description at the expense of tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in premise (butterflies in abyss), but some phrases (“stained glass” wings, “glittering identifiers”) lean toward ornate predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Story coheres thematically but reveals seams under strict editorial scrutiny; brevity works for atmosphere but limits deeper engagement.</comment>
