<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation and past are hinted at but underexplored; the intersection between his thuggish history and current quest for resilience lacks visceral emotional grounding despite introspective prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight pacing balances internal monologue and setting, but the abrupt shift from museums to the static garden disrupts narrative flow; the ending’s thematic payoff feels earned but structurally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts between the sterile museums and electrically charged garden enhance mood; sensory details (humming sculptures, prickling air) deepen the protagonist’s psychological state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (resilience as charged energy, art as permanence) resonate; the ending’s restraint—"leaving the wood on the bench"—powerfully underscores thematic growth without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some generic phrasing (“fractured self,” “lonely pilgrimage”) dilute impact; the static electricity garden introduces originality but risks feeling tacked on as a heavy-handed symbol.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coherence is strained by thinly integrated elements (e.g., experimental garden’s relevance); the brief length feels limiting, yet the theme of resilience lingers ambiguously.</comment>
