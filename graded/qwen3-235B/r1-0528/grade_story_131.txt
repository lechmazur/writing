<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character transformation feels overly simplified; internal conflict is present but lacks layered development. Key motivations are stated rather than organically demonstrated through nuanced action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure suffers from abrupt thematic pivot; the gravitational anomaly-driven climax resolves too conveniently. Pacing accelerates unevenly during the emotional turning point.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through tactile details but underutilized - the anomaly's spatial warping remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (anchor/current imagery) and subtle showing of pivotal moments through sensory details, but emotional resonance undermined by schematic thematic delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh integration of supernatural anomaly with emotional metaphor avoids generic tropes, though closing declaration about courage borders on truism. Writing style avoids overt purple prose but occasionally slips into sententiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptual coherence struggles under the weight of assigned elements; gravitational anomaly feels more like thematic scaffolding than organic narrative force. Final reflection lacks specificity to linger beyond text.</comment>
