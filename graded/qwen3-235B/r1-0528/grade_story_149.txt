<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's role as a prophet feels abstract rather than embodied; internal conflict is stated more than demonstrated through action or choice. Motivation to unify minds lacks tangible psychological grounding, while reliance on symbolic gestures weakens emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Premise-driven structure with vague cause-effect progression; pivotal transformation occurs through vague mystical forces rather than narrative logic. The laundromat incident serves as disconnected prologue rather than integral catalyst.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Richly textured setting through synesthetic descriptions (humming books, tactile obsidian desk), though the giant's study feels more symbolic than functional. Atmospheric cohesion with haunting tone is strong despite tenuous connection to laundromat backstory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose constructs vivid metaphors (scattered minds as discordant notes) and existential thematic weight. Overuses abstract modifiers ("fragile," "terrifying") that dilute emotional impact. Ending's open tension creates resonance but lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ornate phrasing occasionally veers into aestheticized vagueness rather than precise imagery. Metaphors remain fresh but sometimes accumulate without cumulative meaning. Psychological states are often told (e.g., "terrifying clarity") rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution remains unevenly realized. Assigned elements serve thematic scaffolding more than narrative purpose; lyrical passages contrast with underdeveloped stakes. Leaves thematic questions but lacks emotional gravity.</comment>
