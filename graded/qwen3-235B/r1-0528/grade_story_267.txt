<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's transformation lacks internal tension; motivations pivot abruptly on a single object, weakening the psychological nuances of his 'unraveling'.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but constrained by word countâ€”actions feel rushed, particularly the anvil's awakening moment, which demands slower, intimate exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes cosmic grandeur and industrial decay vividly, but sensory details inconsistently ground the reader; 'savage bliss' remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolic contrasts (anvil vs. hyper-tech, 'quiet defiance') and subtext about systemic control elevate the narrative's thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in pairing the anvil with a space resort is striking; however, descriptions occasionally veer into lyrical overindulgence that risks obscuring emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements merge conceptually but strain under the weight of thematic abstraction; the concise format sacrifices emotional immediacy and deeper character immersion.</comment>
