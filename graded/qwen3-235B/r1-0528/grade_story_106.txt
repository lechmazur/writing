<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's sullenness is clear but underdeveloped; motivation to escape feels abrupt despite symbolic epiphany, lacking gradual emotional buildup to sustain transformation. Reactions to stamps/patches hint at deeper psychology but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression from farm to ruins follows logically, but the pivotal shift in the power station feels narratively compressed; cause-effect between symbolism and character change is explicit rather than organically dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive descriptions of drowned ruins and parched farmland create striking contrasts; sensory details (e.g., algae-draped machinery, cracked porcelain soil) enhance tone. The atmosphere powerfully reinforces themes of decay and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors of patches/stamps as boundary-erasing devices are conceptually rich but occasionally over-explained; the finale's "wings" image and epiphany resonate thematically, though some emotional beats rely on exposition over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric specificity clashes with overly ornate phrasing ("crystallizing motivation," "sharp clean energy") and didactic thematic statements; moments of psychological nuance (e.g., borrowed valor) lack layering, leaning on poetic abstraction over human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid thematic cohesion anchors the narrative despite occasional contrivance; the brief form allows focused metaphorical exploration, but the transformative arc's emotional impact is diluted by underdeveloped backstory and accelerated pacing.</comment>
