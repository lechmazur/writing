<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weaknesses in character voice and inconsistent interiority undercut a solid motivation-conceptual link; his "method" feels under-explored despite the dissection motif's promising foundation</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rapid emotional resolution undermines tension built through precise, fragile imagery; plot pivots feel compressed but not incoherent</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting works as metaphorical counterpoint to ghostly themes; preservation lab's tactile descriptions (brittle stems, sepia tones) create haunting sensory immersion</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dissonance motif creates meaningful emotional architecture; recurring symbolism (thorns/stillness/fragility) builds thematic resonance without didacticism</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Overly self-conscious metaphors and occasional poetic affectation ("ghosts clinging like static") border on preciousness but retain emotional kernel</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Successfully balances brevity with thematic resonance, though some elements (elegantly clumsy physicality, temporal constraints of "lunch breaks") remain underutilized narrative opportunities</comment>
