<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poorly defined emotional undercurrents; motivations rely on abstract defiance without humanizing stakes. Character voice lacks distinctiveness despite narration. Physical objects reveal more about him than coherent psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progressions are logical but lack emotional urgency. The connection between theatre finality and hidden technology feels conceptually thin. Pacing falters during exposition-heavy middle passages, though the ending creates momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dripping with atmospheric specificity - greasepaint, ozone, and rust create visceral immersion. The setting isn't just background but an active participant, though its connection to the theatre framing feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric texture (phantom rain, resonant empathy with machines) elevates beyond genre tropes. The subtext about preservation vs. decay lingers, though emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Phrases like "cathedral of rust" verge on overused steampunk imagery. Some overly calculated poeticizing ("prickly wonder") feels self-conscious. The "wilderness wisdom" concept injects uniqueness while maintaining narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole through atmospheric consistency rather than narrative necessity. The self-contained mystery and symbolic richness provide lingering resonance, though deeper emotional engagement remains elusive.</comment>
