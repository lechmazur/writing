<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and action-aligned, but lacks emotional nuance; reverence for existence feels abstract rather than deeply embodied. Voice is consistent but lacks individuality or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single action (observing the apple’s fall), which creates a coherent arc but remains static. Temporal alignment and glyph revelation add structure, yet tension is minimal and pacing feels overly deliberate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visionary juxtaposition of space pirate ship with organic orchard creates a vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details excel (e.g., brass ruler’s warmth, fractal leaf patterns), though pirate scavenging subplot feels disconnected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (falling apple as cyclical renewal) and lyrical metaphors elevate the narrative. The ending’s thematic resonance (knowledge as living record) lingers, though emotional engagement with the character is diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending science-fiction and philosophical inquiry. Avoids formulaic tropes with “authentically artificial” concepts and unconventional methods. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate, but imagery remains fresh and thoughtfully integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong despite eclectic elements; the focus on cyclical renewal unifies disparate parts. Length works as a self-contained observation, though the pirates’ presence feels underutilized thematically.</comment>
