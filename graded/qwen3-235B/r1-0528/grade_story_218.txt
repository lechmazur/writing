<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's reclusive nature and inner conflict are hinted at but remain surface-level; her transformation feels abrupt without sufficient psychological groundwork. The motif of "shadowboxing demons" connects to her game design but lacks emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing is taut for the word limit, but the transition from improv show to carnival relies on convenience over internal logic. The arc from isolation to connection is clear but underserved by the compressed narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Phantasmic carnival's sensory details (warped-glass vibrancy, hummed longing) masterfully juxtapose her tower's decaying solitude. The shifting twilight sky and tactile-yet-ethereal qualities create haunting cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Carousel-as-game-board metaphor carries thematic weight cleverly, but the "forged belonging" message risks being didactic. The final action of "adding a line" symbolizes growth but feels underdramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While avoiding generic phantasm tropes through board game mechanics, the prose occasionally slips into clich√©d emotional language ("quiet ache," "hungry silence"). Some metaphors (spiderwebs=loneliness) lean obvious.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive through strong atmospheric unity; assigned elements function as narrative skeleton rather than organic elements. The brevity works thematically but limits character depth.</comment>
