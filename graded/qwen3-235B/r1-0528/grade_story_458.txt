<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually strong but lacks nuanced internal conflict; her abrupt shift from seeking guidance to decisive action feels underdeveloped despite the symbolic brass button.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to the tight word limit but relies too heavily on exposition over dramatic pacing; the coffee-stain vision as plot driver feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven; the abandoned spaceport’s sensory details (cold metal, thermos) work, but the "spiritually secular" tone remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and thematic cohesion elevate the story; the dissolution of the library into "ethereal river" is haunting, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by abstract overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise overshadowed by clichéd metaphors ("fractal sorrow"); the coffee stain divination borders on magical thinking, weakening the story’s speculative rigor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists, but elements like the timeframe and divination method feel imposed rather than organically integrated; the ending resonates but lacks narrative density.</comment>
