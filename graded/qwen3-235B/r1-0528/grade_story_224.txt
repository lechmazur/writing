<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reveal motivation implicitly through symbolic actions, but inner conflict lacks emotional depth; the minstrel’s transformation feels more atmospheric than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a mystical awakening arc that connects beginning and end, but the meteorite’s rejuvenation mechanism remains abstract; pacing leans on lyrical digressions at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding thrives on paradoxical textures—giant’s clattering plates vs. meteorite’s silence—with immersive, tactile details that create haunting contrasts between chaos and stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (silence as rejuvenation, texture over sound) and haunting imagery elevate the story; ending crystallizes themes without being didactic, though emotional undercurrents remain diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lacks formulaic structures; avoids clichés through unconventional symbolic logic; some metaphors risk over-poeticizing, but the meteorite’s cosmic resonance and subverted hero’s journey feel strikingly original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Elements coalesce into a resonant whole despite tight constraints; certain fantastical explanations are implied rather than explicit, which amplifies conceptual intrigue while slightly muddying causal logic.</grade>
