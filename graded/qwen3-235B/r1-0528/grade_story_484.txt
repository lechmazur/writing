<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and hidden idealism create tension, but the blend feels underexplored; motivations shift abruptly from flippant to pure without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through evocative details rather than action; staircase stain as narrative trigger is original but the transition to confrontation lacks clear stakes, leaving resolution ambiguous within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Decaying graveyard and mansion create a cohesive, oppressive atmosphere; sensory details (hops, cold air, groaning staircase) amplify dread while anchoring the character's emotional state to the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (darkness as decay, mirror shard as fate) enhance thematic tension; the brewer's grim self-awareness contrasts with atmospheric horror, though deeper subtext about duty vs. nihilism remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in combining protest chants with supernatural unease; avoids overt clich√©s but some phrasing ("palpable presence", "coiling dread") edges toward genre predictability without subversion.</comment>
