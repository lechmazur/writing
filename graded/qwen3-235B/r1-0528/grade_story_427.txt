<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are stated more than demonstrated; motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth. The secret about the arm reveals backstory but feels contrived rather than organically connected to prior behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot follows formulaic "rival confrontation" beats; the climax's abrupt shift from technical focus to personal revelation disrupts narrative flow. Resolution feels truncated rather than earned within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on genre clich√©s (abandoned lighthouse, stormy sea) with little concrete sensory detail to make setting distinctive. The sock's "tangibly abstract energy" lacks physical grounding in the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("crucible for endeavors," "aurora perception") exist alongside awkward juxtapositions. The ending's thematic resonance about ambition vs. legacy is promising but underdeveloped. Emotional stakes remain intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tropes (mad scientists, philosophical duels) get minimal subversion. The mechanical arm's dual function feels coincidental rather than inevitable. Language occasionally descends into pretentious abstraction, undermining atmospheric authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story feels assembled from disparate high-concept elements rather than organically grown. The philosophical framework dominates at the expense of human verisimilitude, leaving emotional investment difficult despite its conceptual ambition.</comment>
