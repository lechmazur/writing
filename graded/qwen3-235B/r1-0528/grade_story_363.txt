<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's grief is present but underdeveloped; motivations tied to "passionately indifferent" duty lack full emotional integration; subtle gestures with the bell hint at deeper trauma but insufficiently convey inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves completeness but pacing falters during the revelation about drill resonance; too much emphasis on internal process overshadows external progression; the "marriage of trauma and spectacle" feels under-articulated narratively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through sensory specificity—ozone/smoke, silenced bell, palpable tension between progress and trauma; setting functions as a character itself, with oak wainscoting and whispered archives mirroring Silas' buried regrets.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (machines singing vs. earth's memory) and poetic imagery elevate craft, but thematic underdevelopment—a surface-level opposition between progress and memory—weakens philosophical resonance; ending lacks emotional culmination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality exists in conceptualizing trauma-as-method, but overwritten phrases ("choking dust that haunted his sleep") and over-reliance on industrial gothic tropes undermine freshness; some emotional nuance present but diluted by stylized melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Despite occasional mawkishness, the story creates a haunting metaphor system; its cohesion feels strained by ambitious thematic goals rather than constrained by word count; leaves weighty questions about technological ethics but unevenly resolves them.</comment>
