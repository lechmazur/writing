<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but thinly realized; Elias's internal conflict is conveyed through introspective monologue rather than lived reaction, with gestures toward depth hindered by compressed scope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression follows logical cause-effect with economy, but the arc from isolation to hope feels slightly compressed; the decoding revelation executes cleanly despite constrained runtime.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The void-heavy setting and tactile details (sea glass, console) create vivid atmosphere, though the observatory's mechanics and surrounding cosmos remain sketchily defined despite strong tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Skillful interplay of cosmic metaphor and visceral emotion elevates impact; the resolution avoids trite uplift, balancing quiet awe with visceral determination rather than grandiosity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evasion of genre clich√©s is deliberate, with fresh combinations like "silently audible" waves; prose avoids florid excess but occasionally edges toward familiar melancholic troping ("brutal clarity," "ancient shore").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elaborate integration of constraints creates tension without sacrificing coherence; tonal consistency and emotional residue suggest more than mechanical execution, though compression slightly flattens thematic resonance.</comment>
