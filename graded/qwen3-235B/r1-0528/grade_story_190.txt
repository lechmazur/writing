<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lack of concrete behavioral evidence connecting "cautious smuggler" to pivotal decisions weakens consistency. "Meticulously impulsive" is stated but not structurally demonstrated through cause/effect chains. Motivation shift toward empathy emerges abruptly without visceral groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Predictive framework collapses under surreal juxtapositions (smuggler/anesthesia/painter) without sufficient connective logic. Timeline compression forces discontinuous leaps rather than earned progression. Pacing privileges abstraction over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drought motif is atmospherically rendered but divorced from character stakes - supercomputers and dust remain backdrops. Sensory details (vivid wings, humming) contrast with generic procedural descriptions of surgery/prediction technology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric interplay between fragile/ephemeral symbols (butterfly/music) and systemic forces (drought/justice) creates haunting resonance. Anesthesia's dissociation technique successfully merges inner & outer exposure despite structural weaknesses.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Musical memories" and "enthusiastic apathy" risk becoming abstract fashion accessories. Psychological transitions rely on associative leaps (painter's anguish + butterfly = empathy?) that feel conceptually overdetermined rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>7.0</comment>Story demonstrates ambitious thematic layering with its elements but frequently prioritizes conceptual ambition over narrative plausibility. Some connections between assigned components feel more diagrammatic than visceral.</comment>
