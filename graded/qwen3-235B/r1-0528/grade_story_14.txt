<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (desperation to escape debt) is clear but lacks emotional layers; reactions align with traits but feel surface-level rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (ritual → gamble → defeat) but rushes the emotional collapse; the connection between the candle and the loss could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (salt, wax, pier lights) but occasionally lapses into overwrought descriptors like "chilling, metallic air."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (unfinished candle, tidal chaos) work, but the theme of fate vs. chance lacks subtextual complexity; the ending resonates but feels telegraphed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in setting (tidal station) and tone (laughing tears), but some phrases ("crushing monotony") border on generic; professors’ rants risk melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a bleak whole, but the story leans on "doomed gambler" templates without deep innovation; the short form sacrifices some character introspection.</comment>
