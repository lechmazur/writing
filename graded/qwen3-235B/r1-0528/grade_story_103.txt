<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but occasionally rely on familiar tropes of grief without sufficiently distinctive emotional nuance. The daughter's memory attempts to humanize but feels partially archetypal rather than deeply individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly compressed in emotional climaxes. The resolution of the impossible choice is potent but could better integrate the locket's significance earlier to strengthen cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (salt taste, fractured light, weeping angel motif) establish a haunted atmosphere. However, some imagery ("cold, accusing finger") veers into moderate clich√©, slightly diluting originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant use of symbolic elements (Lyra constellation, shattering light as metaphor for buried guilt) elevates impact. The theme of destructive legacy vs. remembrance resonates, though the "joyful agony" could be rendered with subtler duality between action/feeling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity in its central conceit (objects forming Lyra) but falters with occasional overused descriptors ("weatherbeaten," "jagged reef"). Emotions like regret rely too heavily on direct statements rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity and emotional resonance outweigh minor pacing inconsistencies. Effectively uses constraints as metaphor rather than checklist, though the brevity sacrifices some exploration of secondary elements (e.g., warden's backstory).</comment>
