<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character motivations – death wish and energy mapping – remain disconnected and underexplored, undermining emotional engagement. Nuanced reactions to the bookmark or setting are minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot relies on a climactic binding action, but cause/effect relationships between radio calls and energy flows are unclear. Pacing feels rushed, coherence disrupted by jarring conceptual leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting combines vivid details (ice sculpture, fungi light) with underdeveloped elements. Atmospheric tone oscillates between serene and apocalyptic without cohesive integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors (e.g., diamond dust) and conceptual fusion of mundane/epic impress, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract description over lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on hidden society and death wish tropes without subversion. Sensory details occasionally veer into ornate abstraction. Radio psychic method feels algorithmically "quirky" rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>High-concept ambition clashes with uneven execution. Assigned elements are superficially present but often awkwardly stapled together rather than organically integrated.</comment>
