<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority beyond surface mystique; motivation as "embrace the unknown" is abstract and inconsistently embodied through symbolic gesture rather than concrete action or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as static meditation rather than progression; the gesture of weighing seed against receipt lacks narrative momentum or stakes within the constrained space, feeling more like a vignette than a complete arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in dandelion-saturated atmosphere enhances the tone; the "hopeful melancholy" manifests through vivid contrasts of natural fragility and resilience, though some adjectives verge on overworked lyricism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (balance scale as existential mirror, dandelion code as divine randomness) provoke reflection, but emotional impact diluted by abstract "showing" that often feels like veiled telling through excessive symbolism rather than visceral human resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While avoiding overt templates, the prose occasionally lapses into generic "wilderness mystic" tropes (whispering world, trembling quivers); originality in merging commerce (receipt codes) with natural signs is undermined by schematic precision in thematic execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>The story coheres as atmospheric parable, but feels overly engineered to showcase assigned elements rather than organically arising from a unified vision; lingering resonance weakened by reliance on familiar nature-as-metaphor patterns.</grade>
