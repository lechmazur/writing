<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Hesitation shapes the character's passive struggle, but lacks deeper exploration of how his "awkward dread" affects specific decisions. The postcard's role reveals his introspection over action, but motivation remains more implied than deeply embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear character arc and symbolic logic, but pacing uneven—hermit crab revelation arrives abruptly, diluting cause-effect momentum. The self-contained resolution implies coherence but feels compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere with geothermal vents contrasting frigid tundra. Frost-glazed shells and crunching snow immerse readers, though the setting's political context (forbidden rites) feels underwoven into environmental details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hermit crab metaphor and postcard-as-bridge offer strong symbolism. Ending avoids pat solutions but leans on familiar "adaptation" themes without fully interrogating the cost of compromise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Few clichés; metaphors like "life of hermit crabs" fresh and specific. No purple prose, but some phrasing ("unnatural warmth coaxing fruit") risks over-polishing. Emotions shown through action rather than stated, with rare exceptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive thematic lattice, though some (timeframe, "ephemeral rancor") serve as setup rather than shaping momentum. Leaves resonance through metaphor but lacks piercing originality in structure.</comment>
