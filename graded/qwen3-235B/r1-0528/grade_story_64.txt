<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alchemist's uncertainty and moral conflict are compelling, but internal monologue lacks nuance in showing his dilemma through concrete actions rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Verdict tension mirrors internal conflict effectively, but rapid shifts between memory, setting, and decision feel compressed rather than cohesively structured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and paradoxical "technically wild" marketplace create immersive, original atmosphere that resonates with themes of controlled chaos.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting shows inventiveness, but some descriptions ("bent like willow branches") verge on clich√©d. Emotional weight feels earned but occasionally stated rather than fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious and conceptually rich, though integration of courtroom framing device feels slightly contrived rather than organically connected to alchemical revelation.</comment>
