<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation feels contrived and unrelated to action. No distinct voice or emotional nuance. Motivation's stated "superficial profundity" isn't meaningfully explored through behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels mechanically functional. Action (assassination) drives minimal narrative, but cause-effect logic around "spider's web" method is convoluted and underdeveloped. Pacing lags in establishing tension; ending feels abrupt despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually lush setting creates potent atmosphere through obsessive sensory detail. However, some descriptions verge on self-indulgent; the "baroque asteroid" concept is overwrought but effectively establishes tone. Sensory elements enhance mood but occasionally overwhelm narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and poetic language elevates prose, but emotional impact remains shallow. The final "laugh" lacks earned psychological resonance. Central theme of existential futility hinted at but underdeveloped. Shows but doesn't fully realize deeper meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Language borders on purple prose with excessive ornateness. While imagery is vivid, it occasionally feels calculated. Emotions are shown through action/setting but inner conflict remains baldly stated. Sensory details uneven in specificity; shows authorial fingerprints but with inconsistent execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting coherence and rich imagery anchor the story, but character and thematic underdevelopment weaken overall impact. Some clever element combinations (camera lens as metaphor) are undercut by superficial treatment of conceptual elements like "dawn" and "spiderweb." Lingering impression is more stylistic than substantive.</comment>
