<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's reluctant-to-curious shift is clear but undercontextualized; motivations pivot on internal change without sufficient groundwork, making the emotional arc feel imposed rather than earned. The analytical playfulness manifests in behavior but lacks integration with deeper psychological layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Efficient plot structure navigates tight word count, but pacing compresses key transitions (e.g., emotional pivot at cave discovery feels abrupt). Logical cause-effect chain exists, but the resolution relies on thematic abstraction rather than concrete narrative progression, leaving the arc slightly airless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (sinking boots, calcite glare) and juxtaposition of blight/progress create immersive atmosphere. However, the futuristic hub remains a sketchy contrast rather than a meaningful narrative counterpoint, weakening thematic grounding in the future-past tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery-rich prose conveys geological memory and paradoxical emotion (gleeful sorrow) with linguistic precision. The thematic fusion of ecological grief and human interpretation lingers, though some metaphors (e.g., "weeping wound") verge on melodrama. Ending balances ambiguity and resolution effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clichés through the "grieving orchard" twist but occasionally over-embellishes (e.g., "analytically playful" risks abstraction). Emotions emerge through metaphoric description rather than flat statement, though the dragon tooth trope is only partially subverted through geological melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically resonant whole despite uneven tonal synthesis. The ending’s thematic heft feels intentional, but the futuristic hub’s underutilization and the compressed character arc prevent full realization of narrative potential within the brief canvas.</comment>
