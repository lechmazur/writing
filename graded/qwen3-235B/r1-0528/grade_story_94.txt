<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent integration of Elara's femme fatale traits; her motivations are implied through symbolism but lack visceral personal stakes beyond her own jewelry.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Efficient plot mechanics but the chrono-projector intervention feels abrupt; emotional arc is complete but resolution leans heavily on dialogue rather than demonstrated transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich but lacks tactile/aural details (e.g., pool water's temperature, sound of contrails); the fusion of futuristic tech and metaphysical counseling is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (pool reflections, evanescent clouds) elevates the narrative; the closing gesture with the earrings adds thematic resonance but risks being overly neat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise with evocative metaphors; occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("gravity of desires" over-explained) and emotionally stated rather than embodied grief.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic skeleton but structural elements (e.g., Marcus's off-page transformation) strain credibility within the brevity constraint; memorable for its poetic ideas rather than flawless execution.</comment>
