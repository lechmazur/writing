<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (envy of Queen) is present but underdeveloped; Aris' shift from confidence to empathy lacks nuance, making the transformation feel abrupt despite symbolic richness of his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is effective but the resolution feels rushed - the fingerprint-driven mobilization and abrupt ending with "jubilant remorse" create coherence but lack structural intricacy; beginning/middle connections stronger than closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive beehive atmosphere with specific sensory details (warm drone, golden air, tactile wax surfaces) creates a distinct world; the symbiotic relationship between setting and theme elevates the story beyond typical anthropomorphic setups.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical layering (ruler as fractured authority, fingerprint as universal longing) and evocative final image of "gilded prison" create lingering philosophical resonance; tension between control and freedom drives emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While the bee society framework is familiar, blending human forensic detail (microscopic fingerprint analysis) with hive structure feels fresh; avoids excessive anthropomorphism clich√©s but occasionally leans on overly polished metaphorical language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of elements into thematic cohesion; brevity enhances the story's poetic weight but slight underdevelopment in character arc prevents perfection; leaves lingering questions about freedom vs. security in communal systems.</comment>
