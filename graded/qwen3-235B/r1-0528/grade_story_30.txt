<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Capn Vex's philosophically practical drive to preserve knowledge is clear, but her gambler aspects feel underexplored. The family tree tradition is mentioned but doesn't deeply shape her actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Well-structured with tight tension, but the compressed arc leaves the final confrontation with Corsairs feeling abrupt. The concept-driven plot risks overshadowing emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (ozone, flickering light) create atmosphere, but the space setting lacks specificity - could be any spaceship rather than a pirate navigation room with unique texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors like "flame's sacred disorder" elevate the text. The ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact is slightly diluted by narrative density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids cliche through fusion of medieval and sci-fi elements, but telekinetic dice as translation device borders on mechanistic convenience. Family tradition feels formulaically inserted as moral justification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated with thematic purpose, though some (planting tradition, navigation room specificity) remain underexploited. Compressed form serves the urgent narrative well.</comment>
