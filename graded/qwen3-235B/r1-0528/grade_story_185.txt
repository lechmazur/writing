<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's "peculiar" traits and calmness are stated but not psychologically explored; motivation feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Reactions to the pencil and keys lack idiosyncratic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Non-linear plot hinges on a single action, creating structural simplicity; cause-effect is logical but lacks traditional arc. Pacing feels compressed rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally sterile setting; sensory details prioritize cosmic scale over intimate atmosphere. Timeframe's implications remain underexploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements function logically but lack organic unity; the story feels engineered to accommodate them. Compression sacrifices emotional weight and thematic resonance.</comment>
