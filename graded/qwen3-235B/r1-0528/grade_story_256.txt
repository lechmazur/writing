<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is poetic but abstract, lacking concrete emotional stakes or distinct voice. The assigned traits shape surface-level conflict but fail to create visceral investment or psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a surreal arc but stumbles over cause/effect logic. Sudden dissolutions of setting lack narrative grounding; resolution feels abrupt despite the contained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (midnight unease vs. celestial wonder) but inconsistent in sensory execution. Transitions between contrasting worlds require stronger tethering through concrete tactile details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery clashes with heavy reliance on conceptual abstractions ("horizon's promise") that distance emotional engagement. Metaphors occasionally achieve resonance but often feel performative rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clinically precise phrases ("floating island cloud cafe") and cosmic metaphors border on sterile invention rather than organic creativity. Stylized despair feels recycled rather than viscerally expressed through character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exists but execution is hobbled by thematic vagueness and tonal whiplash. Assigned elements present but often function as checklists rather than narrative necessities.</comment>
