<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflict feels abstract rather than viscerally rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight structure with beginning/middle/end, but pacing in the middle relies heavily on internal monologue without concrete narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steampunk setting is richly rendered with atmospheric sensory details that juxtapose mechanical indifference against human vulnerability, deepening thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and visceral sensory writing elevate the storytelling, though emotional catharsis feels intellectualized rather than earned through narrative action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some overused phrases lurk (e.g., "hollow victory") but the prose mostly avoids clich√©; emotional shifts are shown through environment rather than formulaic sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements like the cassette deck and sticker sheet are seamlessly integrated; the ending lingers thematically despite minor predictability in the redemption arc.</comment>
