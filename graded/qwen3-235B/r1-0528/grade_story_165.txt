<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation tied to justice for the Vale, but "gentle" feels underdeveloped beyond passive reactions; inner conflict between joy and dread hints at complexity, yet her personality remains thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from fracture to fusion, with reversed messages driving action. Pacing tightens toward climax but strains brevity—consequences for dwarves feel rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid subterranean imagery (glowing runes, prismatic horrors, vines softening stone) creates haunting beauty. Atmosphere merges with theme, though dwarves’ worldbuilding feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elicits awe and melancholy through metaphors like "frozen bells" and symbolic justice-as-restoration. Ending’s thematic clarity elevates the piece, though some "showing" over "telling" needed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally slips into overwrought phrases ("prismatic horrors and hopes," "conjurer’s quiet joy"). Subverts revenge tropes but relies on familiar "blood sacrifice" cliche.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize: the stained glass object and underground setting are indispensable. Short length sharpens emotional focus but leaves dwarves’ transformed perspective unexplored.</comment>
