<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation and telekinesis lack visceral integration; transformation theme sketched but not deeply embodied in actions or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot pivots on abstract revelations over tangible progression; flashbacks drive internal stakes but risk narrative fragmentation within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Carnival decay vividly rendered, but chopstick wrapper's role in world logic feels arbitrarily symbolic rather than organically tied to the setting's mythic layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., wrapper as memory vessel) elevate theme; prose lush but occasionally obscures emotional immediacy through overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Borders on purple prose with "tapestry of lost legends" tropes; telekinesis-as-bookbinding connection feels underexplored despite original premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition evident, but thematic density occasionally strains cohesion; lingers more in ideas than in character or action grounding.</comment>
