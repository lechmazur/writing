<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (finding twin to avoid apocalypse) is clear but underexplored; Silas feels like a vessel for plot rather than a full character, with limited psychological depth despite cryptic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from market to mountain confrontation effectively but feels rushed; causal logic (hiring actors → confrontation → artifact revelation) is present but lacks payoff; abrupt ending weakens narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere of crystal shadows and "thin, sharp air" creates eerie tone, but sensory details feel underdeveloped; market/future contrast is superficial; setting doesn't meaningfully influence character choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concept of "temporal grenade" offers philosophical intrigue; some evocative lines ("forbidden knowledge...temporal frequencies") but surface-level exploration; dialogue lacks subtext, ending feels like setup for larger story without internalized resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Baseball-as-time-artifact idea avoids typical clichés, but twin/prophesy framework feels overly familiar; avoids purple prose but occasionally substitutes ambiguity for depth; emotional stakes remain stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story attempts ambitious fusion of metaphysical and personal stakes but struggles with balance; setting/prophecy framework feels like scaffolding rather than organic whole; thematic questions about identity/time lack narrative weight.</comment>
