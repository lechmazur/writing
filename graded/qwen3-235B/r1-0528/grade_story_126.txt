<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lack of individual traits and personal history beyond assigned motivation weakens emotional investment; motivations are consistent but underexplored, relying on archetypal symbolism rather than human complexity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ascent arc but sacrifices structural complexity for poetic imagery; cause-effect logic maintains coherence despite rapid progression into surrealism</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vividly realized through decaying poster aesthetics and sensory contrasts; sterile station vs. lost Earth creates potent atmospheric tension that directly supports thematic intent</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Somewhat guilty of ornate phrasing ("vortex of swirling impossible colors") but redeems itself through subversive metaphors like decay as portal; avoids complete trope reliance through surreal innovation</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Despite tight constraints, elements work synergistically to form cohesive metaphorical tapestry rather than checklist inclusion; leaves readers contemplating environmental consequence and mythic transformation</comment>
