<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's inventor background faintly informs her methods but lacks depth in showing how her intellect interacts with emotional drive; motivations tied to an "impossible promise" create psychological depth, but her curiosity and technical skills don't fully integrate to form a coherent persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Opening mystery propels the narrative forward with atmospheric momentum, but the transition from empirical rain-pattern analysis to metaphysical resonance lacks causal logic; the circular structure (promise-to-promise) creates emotional closure despite compressed exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (rain-beaded rigging, algae-slick beams) create immersive decay; the graveyard's skeletal imagery perfectly mirrors the theme of resurrecting fractured history; atmosphere occasionally overpowers narrative clarity in key emotional moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (shattered glass/time, stardust/ambition) elevates the narrative; the "cosmic intimacy" motif creates haunting resonance; while the ending avoids pat resolution, it risks thematic ambiguity by not fully interrogating the implications of returning stardust to the sky.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original concept of using rain patterns as historical cartography demonstrates ingenuity; avoids sentimentalizing the ghostly elements; emotional depth emerges through tactile details (stone's hum against bones) rather than exposition; a few over-crafted similes ("bottle moonlight") border on self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Creative synthesis across elements (the stardust ring-box as convergence of past/promise/space) creates cohesion; certain forced connections (rain patterns as historical navigation tool) strain plausibility; leaves lingering questions about celestial stewardship rather than simple nostalgia.</comment>
