<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character traits as empath and introvert are established but could use deeper exploration of internal conflicts. Motivation to 'champion outcasts' is clear, but emotional stakes feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying arc from discovery to realization, but the transition from finding marionette to epiphany lacks gradual tension. Pacing prioritizes thematic beats over organic character reaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Asteroid hideout has vivid visual texture but underutilizes sensory details beyond sight. Mountain wisdom's Earthbound origin feels tonally disjointed with sci-fi setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic framework (marionette = unity, starfish = stability). Ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than character-specific moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and philosophical elements avoids genre clich√©s. Some overly decorative language ("latent purpose, the obvious hidden potential") borders on purple prose, but core metaphors feel fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interconnected with themes, though some (asteroid setting, marionette) require imaginative leaps to fully integrate. Leaves intriguing thematic resonance but sacrifices some narrative immediacy for poetic abstraction.</comment>
