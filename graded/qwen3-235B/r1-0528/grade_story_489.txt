<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Poorly realized character lacks distinct voice or internal logic, motivations stated rather than dramatized. 'Unseen observer' remains undefined except through actions that contradict rather than clarify its nature. Impersonal narration fails to provide human (or supernatural) logic behind decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmented structure strains credibility through convenient connections between disparate elements (whale/dancer/observer). Logical gaps in how elements interact. Resolution feels abrupt despite strong symbolic payoff. Attempts at mythic structure undermined by underdeveloped through-lines. Pacing collapses under compressed constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere created through precise sensory details - the cold rage of spirits feels tactile, the brass fittings' patina visualizable. Time-worn decay of setting masterfully rendered. Haunted lighthouse establishes perfect tension between technological obsolescence and spiritual persistence. Environmental storytelling elevates the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric density creates lingering resonance - spirit rage transforming into whale-song is particularly powerful. Subtext about ephemeral traditions working on multiple levels. Show-don't-tell principle honored through sonic symbolism. Ending's thematic synthesis elevates beyond mere supernatural tale. Minor deductions for slight over-reliance on abstract adjectives.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual combinations (plastic whistle's sacred function is especially inventive). Some risk in dancer/whale parallel feels slightly formulaic. Language remains purposeful without descending into floridity. Emotional undercurrents implied through environmental shifts rather than explicit statements. The 'observer' concept shows human-like nuance in its protective rage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements work in counterpoint rather than collision. The integration of disparate parts demonstrates clear authorial intent without feeling mechanical. Time-bending connections between characters remain thematically grounded. Emotional residue lingers past final line through careful juxtaposition of vanishing traditions. Technical limitations of short form embraced rather than resisted.</comment>
