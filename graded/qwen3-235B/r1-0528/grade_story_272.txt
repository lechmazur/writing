<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's social awkwardness is evident in muttered equations and isolation, but depth is limited by reliance on abstract introspection over concrete behavior; motivation to confront regret is clear but thinly realized through technical jargon rather than emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Decrypting backwards drives plot forward logically, creating a closed loop between archive and whistle; pacing compresses into a single resonant moment, but the abrupt shift from decryption to revelation lacks narrative scaffolding for the climax's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Diner's fluorescent hum and pre-dawn atmosphere mirror Silas's restless mind; sensory details like lukewarm coffee and table vibration ground the surreal in the mundane, though digital archive vs. physical setting tension slightly unexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pure, resonant whistle note symbolizes hope amid decay; ending avoids sentimentality by literalizing 'reaping' through technical resolution; thematic cohesion between regret and innovation remains poignant, undercut slightly by occasional overdetermined metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tree of regret" metaphor borders on clich√© but is salvaged by specific imagery (storm-felled oak, geometric code); prose veers toward purple prose ("dredging silt from riverbed") but maintains stylistic consistency and emotional subtext through action rather than explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements are welded into a self-contained emotional arc; brevity works as a choice, not a constraint; the thematic axis between technology and redemption feels intentional, though deeper exploration of "forgotten arts" might have elevated it further.</comment>
