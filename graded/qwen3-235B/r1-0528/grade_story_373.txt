<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Premise-driven but shallow; motivation lacks psychological depth beyond surface-level "forbidden knowledge" trope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-action plot works within constraints but lacks narrative tension; connection between rummaging and hacking feels schematic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory richness of drowned motels and bioluminescent trench creates immersive world; atmospheric excellence almost compensates for narrative thinness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-isms through precise, original imagery but occasionally slips into genre reflexiveness rather than genuine subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite constraints; thematic unity between mechanical violation and environmental degradation suggests deeper conceptual ambition.</comment>
