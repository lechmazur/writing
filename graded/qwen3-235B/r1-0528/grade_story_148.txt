<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's desert-storm-chaser persona justifies her tenacity but emotional layers remain underexplored. Her pivot from brute force to "nostalgic innovation" is logical yet under-mapped in terms of internal transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently from discovery to resolution, though decoding the tapestry strains credulity slightly. The concise arc works well within word limits, balancing action with thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Monastery's frost-bitten isolation contrasts desert energy strikingly. Sensory details (tallow candlelight, groaning metal) immerse readers. Tapestry schematic weakens immersion temporarily.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (carousel as renewal, tongs as transformation) resonate. Thematic unity in patience vs. storm-chasing aligns with character arc. Ending achieves emotional resonance through visual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storm chaser ↔ monastery contrast subverts expectations. Avoids overt clichés, though tapestry-decoding borders on convenient. Prose remains purposeful despite occasional lush descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly seamless but relies too heavily on tapestry revelation as narrative shortcut. Themes of transformation linger, though depth could rival higher-tier stories.</comment>
