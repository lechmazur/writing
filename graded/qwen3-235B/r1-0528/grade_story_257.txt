<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's philosophical background is subtly hinted but remains underexplored; motivation to "restore lost faith" in abstract terms lacks visceral emotional grounding despite poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs elegantly from static porch sweeping to departure, but pivotal moments like the lighthouse epiphany feel accelerated; postcard collection as method lacks detailed integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through firefly symbolism and mist-shrouded woods; sensory details like chalkboard smudges and diesel-scented bus stations deepen mood while maintaining cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor layers (e.g., chalkboard erasure as shedding identity) and cyclical firefly imagery create resonant subtext; ending delivers thematic closure through tangible objects-as-transformations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Risks lapsing into "yearning hero" tropes with phrases like "stitched compass from longing"; firefly metaphors are fresh, but some descriptors ("bruised exhilaration") tilt toward abstract overconcretion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves quiet emotional grandeur through minimalist arc and symbolic objects; thematic integration of assigned elements occasionally strains toward checklist fulfillment rather than organic inevitability.</comment>
