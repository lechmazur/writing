<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Frantic cook remains underdeveloped; his profession lacks narrative connection to actions or decisions. Motivation (exposing truth) is clear but inadequately tied to character traits. Relic transformation of walking stick lacks personal resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on sudden revelations without sufficient buildup or resolution within word limits. Cause-effect between letters, notches, and the facility's corruption feels compressed. Pacing prioritizes explanation over emotional or narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dust and decay create strong sensory immersion, but atmospheric details often overshadow functional setting integration. Timeframe through centuries of dust is inconsistently applied; some metaphorical uses of setting lack functional narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memorable metaphorical imagery (pencil eraser as revolutionary tool, notches as truth markers) elevates impact. Theme of institutional corruption is clear, though emotional engagement with protagonist's transformation feels surface-level and abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some innovative combinations (cook protagonist, wooden data storage) stand out, but surface clichés remain (conspiracy in hidden documents, hero's sudden resolve). Language occasionally veers into overly stylized phrasing that distracts from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements form functional scaffold but hinder cohesion; cook’s profession feels arbitrary. Premise offers intellectual intrigue but lacks visceral connection or narrative inevitability. Lingering questions about worldbuilding don’t deepen meaning.</comment>
