<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Eli's distracted nature is shown through fixation on light patterns and the fractured locket. Weakness: Character's internal conflict between avoidance of conflict and compelled action lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Clear three-act structure (problem, infiltration, resolution) with tight constraints. Weakness: Rushed pacing in mid-infiltration sequence undermines tension. Logical cause/effect for tool use, but abrupt shifts in action flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Neon-slicked decay and holographic trash create immersive contrasts. Weakness: Sensory details overload at the expense of connecting the cyberpunk framework to character motivations beyond aesthetic window dressing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength: Striking metaphors like "data-ghosts swirling like fireflies" and theme of tactile humanity in digital decay. Weakness: Emotional resolution feels simplistic - holographic parents reduced to "shimmering" rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: Original concept through juxtaposing blacksmith tools against cyberpunk. Weakness: Overly stylized descriptions ("snarled teeth" escalator) border on clich√©. Nuanced emotion present but some motivations stated rather than shown through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Cohesive interplay of analog vs. digital motifs. Weakness: Story feels like proof-of-concept rather than fully realized narrative; brevity undermines deeper exploration of "fractured illusions" theme.</comment>
