<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are clear and consistent, but depth beyond their assigned traits remains underexplored. Finn's frantic defense of "truth" lacks layers, while Silas' "humorous solemnity" hints at complexity without full realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight kill-order arc, but the compressed word count strains cause-effect clarity in tense shifts (reversed echoes' psychological impact). The ending's plush rabbit placement feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent reef creates haunting atmosphere with vivid aquatic sensory details (pulsating anemones, disorienting acoustics), but the carnival plush' symbolic connection to the setting remains underdeveloped beyond absurd contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("Current" = truth) and reverse-echoed sound design create unsettling tension. The juxtaposition of grotesque plushie with murder elevates to haunting reflection on fanaticism's absurdity, though emotional impact isn't fully crystallized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids obvious aquatic tropes with "Deep Current" theology and sonic dampener tech. Some purple prose ("murky reflection of morality") and Finn's overly logical panic dilute authenticity, but the plush rabbit's macabre symbolism stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Compelling fusion of surreal elements under tight constraints. The plush rabbit's thematic role feels underexplored, but the zealot's chilling logic and oceanic metaphysics justify its compact structure's momentum.</comment>
