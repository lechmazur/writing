<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s solitude and conflict are evident, but emotional depth feels occasionally overwritten rather than viscerally earned through action; motivation to break cycles is clear but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot’s internal arc is coherent, but the cosmic blink device, while imaginative, risks abstraction over emotional immediacy; pacing is deliberate but occasionally glacial.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is lush and symbolic, with sensory details (e.g., “sharpened tang of preserved leaves”) that ground the surreal—every element amplifies the character’s inner world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storytelling resonates with metaphor (mask, trembling aspen) and subtextual tension; the ending avoids preachiness, favoring quiet, earned catharsis over melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evokes originality through surreal conceits but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing (“spectral forests”); emotional beats are nuanced, though tonal consistency wavers in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly woven into a thematically resonant whole; the brief format sharpens the narrative’s philosophical stakes without sacrificing clarity or emotional impact.</comment>
