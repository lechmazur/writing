<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract descriptors like 'shame' without grounding in specific actions or backstory. Motivation (fracturing shame) lacks visceral connection to protagonist's actions. Internal conflict remains vaguely sketched despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression from invention to activation to resolution. Causal logic between DNA coding and pattern manifestation is intuitive in context, but emotional arc truncates before full payoff. Pacing drags slightly at climax with excessive imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid neon/orchard hybrid imagery dominates, but cyberpunk elements feel surface-level. Atmosphere supports tone but fails to deepen character psychology or thematic intent. Sensory details overwhelm functional integration with plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor (shame as fractal prison) creates layered resonance. The DNA/bell synthesis as emotional liberation combines craft and subtext effectively. Ending balances ambiguity and resolution. Prose occasionally prioritizes style over clarity but achieves moments of poetic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ('passionate subtlety') verge on self-parody, but DNA-fractal motifs offer genuine innovation. Avoids major tropes through biological/spiritual fusion. Emotional shifts remain somewhat abstracted, relying more on symbolism than earned visceral connection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but not indispensably. The forced brevity denies full exploration of key connections (e.g., radio broadcast's thematic role). Lingering themes exist but could be sharpened. Shows literary potential compromised by occasional abstraction-for-abstraction's sake tendencies.</comment>
