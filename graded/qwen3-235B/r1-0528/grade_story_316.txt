<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's timidity is present but sometimes overshadowed by narrative convenience; her childhood promise drives the plot but lacks gradual emotional buildup to fully cement her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but struggles with pacing in the constraint; the scoreboard subplot feels under-explained, while the tapestry's unveiling is rushed despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting blends decay and rebirth evocatively (e.g., temple looms vs. arcade stillness), though the ancient/modern synthesis sometimes feels symbolic overkill rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtly layered symbolism (weaving as healing, rust-to-ribbon metamorphosis) delivers emotional resonance; conclusion feels earned rather than forced, with lyrical but purposeful prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in premise but occasionally falters into ornate descriptions ("timid fingers finding the latch"); emotional subtext is present but occasionally muted by heavy metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere around trauma-to-renewal theme; some elements (e.g., arcade) feel conceptually strained to fit, undercutting potential cohesion.</comment>
