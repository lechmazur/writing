<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is hinted through actions and symbols, but psychological complexity remains underexplored. Motivation ties to war's cost but lacks nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot advances coherently but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., virtual call to ambush). Some pacing inconsistencies disrupt flow in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details build a haunting atmosphere, though the "screaming silence" concept feels over-stylized. The setting enhances tone but occasionally overshadows narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like the bead and fractured mirror add thematic resonance, yet emotional beats often lean on poetic abstraction rather than concrete, visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Contains fresh uses of symbols (e.g., bead as tactile mantra), but the stoic vigilante archetype and "abandoned" setting border on overused. Lacks subversive depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but occasionally feel checklist-driven. The core theme is present, but the story doesn't transcend its components into memorable uniqueness.</comment>
