<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Painter's solitude and reverence for confessions suggest depth, but minimal dialogue/internal monologue limits psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Circular structure (begins/ends in garden) works but pacing feels uneven; solar flare climax introduced too abruptly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements fused into organic whole; brief length magnifies emotional resonance rather than constraining it.</comment>
