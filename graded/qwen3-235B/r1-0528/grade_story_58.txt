<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are clear but lack depth; motivation is consistent but underexplored beneath surface-level duty and storm metaphors. Reactions to the radio signal are competent but lack human emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels rushed; the shift from observation to radical action lacks sufficient tension. Coherence exists but relies on forced epiphany rather than organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details (moth cases, flickering lights), but forced "sanctified dread" occasionally feels performative rather than immersive. Setting shapes tension unevenly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong subtextual layer in coded comedy-as-weaponry. The moth/storm symbolism works, but emotional impact suffers from excessive exposition about inner struggles rather than showing them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Pockets of freshness (comedy-as-code) undercut by formulaic phrases ("flickering city lights," "dying stars"). Tone inconsistencies and overly elaborate metaphors suggest AI-era overthinking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. The moth tower's specificity doesn't earn its presence, and the twist strains credibility. Leaves questions but few resonant answers.</comment>
