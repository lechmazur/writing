<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Baron's motivation as an archivist partially drives action but lacks emotional depth; his transformation feels more thematic than psychologically nuanced. Ghostly figure exists largely as symbolic conduit, not fully realized character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on symbolic exchange rather than cause-effect momentum; cohesive atmospheric arc but minimal structural progression within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually rich catacomb/orchard fusion creates haunting, otherworldly atmosphere; sensory details ground the surreal elements effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (roots/bones/bottle); subtext about memory cycles resonates; ending crystallizes thematic weight through poetic understatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Ethereal tone feels intentional but risks overwrought descriptors; some phrases border on clich√©, though metaphors like "moonlight on water" elevate. Emotional impact emerges through subtext rather than explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Elements combine inventively</grade> to explore memory ecology, though not all serve narrative equally; leaves lingering thematic resonance despite some mechanical seams.</comment>
