<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character defined through introspection but lacks depth; motivation clear but underexplored, with insufficient interplay between his role as a caretaker and his obsession with forbidden knowledge. "Enthusiastic apathy" remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot centers on a single static action (hacking), with minimal progression. Cause-effect logic holds, but the rigid word limit flattens the arc. Atmospheric immersion offsets but doesn't resolve the lack of structural dynamism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ozone, brine, cooling fans) create a hauntingly tactile setting. The decayed repair station as a liminal space between collapse and rebirth feels viscerally intertwined with the character's obsession and the archives' cosmic implications.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Provocative metaphors ("newborn galaxy") and thematic tension between entropy and creation elevate the narrative. The closing juxtaposition of waves' rhythm against server hum offers resonant ambiguity about knowledge's futility or necessity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through poetic grit and philosophical subtext. Avoids purple prose through precise imagery. Emotional resonance emerges through environmental cues (lavender's forgotten calm vs. digital overload) rather than explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive meditation on decay vs. ambition. The spare length feels purposeful, prioritizing psychological and cosmic unease over plot. Lingering tension between preservation and destructive curiosity lingers post-reading.</comment>
