<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched but lacks psychological depth; motivation feels stated rather than organically explored through conflict or internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but compressed; the central action of aligning marbles is inventive, yet the emotional stakes feel understated despite a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere with tactile sensory details; neon desperation and rain-soaked tension enhance the theme, though cyberpunk tropes occasionally dilute originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (“compass pointing true north”) and vivid imagery elevate the prose, but the emotional core relies too heavily on explicitly stated themes of kindness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding blends cliché and innovation; marbles-to-cryptography method is inventive, but “fashionably unfashionable” and “fervent apathy” lean on oxymoronic shorthand rather than lived-in nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates assignments, balancing action, tone, and theme within constraints; the ending lingers but lacks full emotional payoff.</comment>
