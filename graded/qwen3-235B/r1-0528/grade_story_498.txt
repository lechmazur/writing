<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's nervousness and motivation are clear through symbolic actions (seed pods, communal gardens), but depth of personality beyond his defiance and fragility is underdeveloped, making him more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear progression from desperation to resolve, with the detour serving as the catalytic event. However, some transitions (e.g., immediate shift from the stones to decision-making) feel slightly rushed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (midwinter's harshness, enclave's xenophobia), but the societal mechanics of the enclave and the gardens' societal role remain underexplored, limiting full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (seeds as resilience, stones as indifference) is powerful and thematically cohesive. The ending crystallizes the story’s message effectively, though the emotional resonance leans heavily on metaphor rather than nuanced character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mixes fresh imagery (e.g., "lichen-crusted stones") with some predictable phrasing ("tyranny of indifference"). The narrative avoids overt clichés but occasionally defaults to lyrical abstraction instead of concrete emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are thematically integrated and support a cohesive message about defiance and endurance. However, the story’s brevity and reliance on symbolic abstraction slightly dilute its emotional urgency and worldbuilding specificity.</comment>
