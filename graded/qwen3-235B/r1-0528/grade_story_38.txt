<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and non-violent motivation are present but not thoroughly explored; internal conflict is clear but development remains surface-level; actions and resolution align with established traits but lack deeper psychological nuance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure follows clear arc but pacing feels slightly rushed; party confession disrupts momentum; connection between beginning (problem) and end (resolution) is coherent but underdeveloped for complete satisfaction</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Enriched through specific sensory details (dust/deep-rooted scents, subway silence, tactile descriptions of samples); atmosphere consistently supports thematic concerns; haunted attic as liminal space creates effective tension with urban subway</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering and rich imagery elevate above formula; ending resonates thematically but emotional impact is muted; dialogue scene feels underwritten; writing style effectively builds mood but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative progression</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic storytelling through original metaphors and concept; resists predictable resolution with non-violent conclusion; some purple prose in overqualified descriptions; handling of internal conflict shows human nuance but occasionally relies on familiar melancholic artist tropes</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work together toward theme exploration but integration varies; poetic style supports but sometimes overwhelms narrative; length reveals conceptual depth; leaves thematic questions about understanding vs. action but lacks full emotional resonance for lasting impact</comment>
