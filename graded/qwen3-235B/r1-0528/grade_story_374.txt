<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyra and Hemlock’s motivations (cosmic curiosity vs. inherited grudge) are clear but underexplored in the limited space; their conflict resolution feels abrupt, though their rivalry’s roots shape their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot centers on a static bickering scene with a sudden truce; beginning/middle/end are implied through emotional shifts, but the pivotal stamp moment feels slightly rushed within the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Neo Veridia’s fusion of retro stables and chrome skyscrapers is vividly rendered; ozone and hay, mag-lev hums and hoofbeats contrast effectively, enriching the theme of old clashing with new.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery like “mother-of-pearl skies” and the stamp’s decayed symbolism deepen subtext; ending’s “language both rivals could understand” delivers emotional resonance through understated wonder.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Few clichés; the “fractured hourglass” cloud and “dappled mare” avoid overused phrasing. Hemlock’s grudging awe feels human, not overly logical. Atmosphere avoids purple prose despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (stamp, stables, feuds) feel purposefully woven, not arbitrary; the compact form serves the story’s focus on a pivotal moment, though thematic richness slightly outpaces character depth.</comment>
