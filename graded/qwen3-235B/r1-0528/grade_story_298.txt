<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional depth remains abstract; the chameleon trait shapes actions superficially but lacks physiological or psychological nuance. The dress reveals motivation but doesn't fully expose internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g. solving case in sealed archives). The "reproduce" action drives narrative, though emotional payoff feels preordained rather than earned. Pacing is efficient but resolution strains credibility within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding shines with visceral contrasts (crumbling palace vs. scavenged tech) and sensory immersion. Sunlight/debris imagery creates haunting ambiance. However, the "post-oil" element remains atmospheric rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic resonance between decaying setting and emotional decay; chameleon metaphor deepens theme of authenticity. Ending achieves catharsis through subtext rather than exposition. Subtle showing of grief through performance makes ending feel earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cold-case solving follows predictable beats despite unique setting. Metaphors (dust motes as anxiety) work but occasionally verge on over-explanation. Chameleon trait avoids cliché but other elements (sealed archives) feel procedural. Emotional layers exist but aren't uniformly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper thematic synergy—theatricality vs. authenticity is clear but post-oil context feels underdeveloped. The "anxious serenity" tone lingers, suggesting subtextual tensions between decay and artifice worth unpacking.</comment>
