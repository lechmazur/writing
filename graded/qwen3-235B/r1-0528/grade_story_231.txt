<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Enkidu’s sentimentality and spontaneous nature drive key actions, but motivations (e.g., “justice”) sometimes feel abstract. His transformation is hinted but lacks emotional depth in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic structure (anchor, coordinates) ties beginning to end, but the escape sequence drags. Pacing is uneven; some plot mechanics (e.g., sudden fight choreography) strain credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting via sensory details (dust, metal filigree, lantern glints). The Sumerian palace isn’t just backdrop—it amplifies the decay of its society through contrast with Enkidu’s pastoral simplicity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“dagger of truth”) and layered themes (justice vs. innocence) resonate, but dialogue (“Does Uruk’s wealth feed only jackals?”) feels heavy-handed rather than subtextual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some phrases (“whispered of royalty long dust”) veer toward cliché. The “chaotic humility” tone is compellingly paradoxical, but overuse of abstract descriptors (“weight of intervention”) occasionally dulls impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than most, but the hairpin’s coordinates strain plausibility. The Sumerian context enriches themes, yet the ship’s framing device feels tacked on rather than integral.</comment>
