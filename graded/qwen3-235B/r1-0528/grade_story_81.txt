<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Weak characterization beyond archetypal roles; whispering advisor lacks emotional depth, protagonist is reactive without clear psychological motivation despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fractured temporal structure challenges coherence but maintains momentum through urgent imagery; resolution feels abrupt but thematically consistent within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful sensory immersion in time-warped environment; rusty dissolution contrasts with tactile driftwood/coin details to create haunting temporal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegantly intertwines metaphorical resonance of erosion/preservation; profound concept undercut by occasional overwrought phrasing like "futuristic nostalgia"; lingers emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original approach to time mechanics without genre tropes; avoids clich√©s through poetic specificity; "taffy seconds" and "temporal eddies" show linguistic daring without excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Seamless integration of all assigned elements; brevity becomes strength through concentrated symbolic density; invites contemplation beyond narrative closure.</comment>
