<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Polite mannerisms are consistent but overly exaggerated rather than deeply revealing. Motivation for studying earth spirits is clear but underdeveloped; actions (eavesdropping, apologizing) align with traits but lack psychological complexity. The root's rebuttal exposes hypocrisy better than character's own awareness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight eavesdropping-to-interruption arc but sacrifices emotional stakes for whimsy. The assigned action (eavesdropping) drives narrative yet strains logic through abrupt root intervention. Connection between beginning (salt crystal) and end (anchored by root) exists but lacks gradual tension. Pacing handles transitions better than thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mirrored settings (salt chamber/laundry cycles) create haunting industrial-mystical fusion. Sensory details (lavender steam, creaking susurrus) immerse effectively. The cardboard box’s resonance with chamber’s "mineral song" exemplifies meaningful object-setting synergy. Timeframe-as-metaphor for cyclical natural processes enhances theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose ("voices woven into roots") elevates craft, though some imagery (frozen tears) borders on cliche. The undermining irony—politeness becoming intrusion—is thematically resonant. Ending’s laundry-cycle laughter as passive-aggressive sentience offers memorable subtext about domestic vs natural sacredness. Central conflict (listening vs being heard) remains potent within constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strikes originality with laundry machinery fused to geomancy but occasionally slips into preciousness with overqualified adjectives. The cardboard box avoids gimmickry but "thump-swoosh" repetition risks sing-song rhythm. Character logic holds internally but avoids deeper exploration of why obnoxiousness constitutes trespass. Subverts trope through polite eavesdropping as modern transgression against ancient systems.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly—salt chamber/laundry duality especially—but broader themes (academic obsession, ecological reciprocity) remain hinted rather than piercing. The story's strength lies in texture over message, though closing laughter motif lingers as sly commentary on domestic vs wild sacred spaces.</comment>
