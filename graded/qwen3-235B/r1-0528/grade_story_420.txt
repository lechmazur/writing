<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal links between the ring, bones, and tree are conceptually sound but the swift resolution risks feeling rushed, undermining gradual tension release; structure holds but strains at edges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>ELEMENTS are skillfully interwoven into thematic skeleton but occasionally prioritize symbolic density over narrative breathing room; brevity aids emotional resonance more than plot scope.</comment>
