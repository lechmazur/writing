<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has compelling contradictions (philosopher-king homelessness) but motivations remain abstract. Transformation lacks the visceral human dimension needed for full credibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows logical causality with tight arcs, but the labyrinth's sudden compliance feels slightly earned too easily despite emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gorgeously rendered atmosphere with lanterns and kaleidoscope imagery; sensory details create a dreamlike space that enhances the story's thematic tension between fragmentation and wholeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence around redemption through paradox; poetic metaphors transcend surface narrative but some emotional beats could be more subtly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre traps, but certain phrases ("wept," "kingdom he could finally see clearly") flirt with clich√© even as the labyrinth's reinterpretation demonstrates conceptual innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements intertwine cohesively, though the brevity occasionally strains the philosophical density; maintains authorial voice without feeling artificially constructed.</comment>
