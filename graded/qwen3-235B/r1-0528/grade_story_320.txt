<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits are conceptually integrated but lack emotional depth; motivation is clear but underexplored, with actions serving plot over psychological realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression via social media is inventive and coherent, though resolution feels abrupt despite logical cause-effect chain; pacing balances brevity with narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting's sensory immersion (bioluminescent fish, coral-encrusted decay) masterfully merges with cosmic themes; underwater environment enhances both mystery and existential tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and layered theme (truth's digital dissemination vs isolation) engage intellectually, but emotional resonance remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting details are fresh, but "passionate disinterest" concept feels stated rather than dramatized; some phrases ("echo of regret") risk poetic overuse without tangible subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story's ambition surpasses technical polish; elements combine innovatively but unevenly - atmosphere triumphs over fully realized thematic synthesis.</comment>
