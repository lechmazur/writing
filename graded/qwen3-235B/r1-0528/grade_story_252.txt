<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; the thief’s internal conflict manifests through plot mechanics more than layered emotionality. The wooden block reflects guilt yet doesn’t fully explore how his profession shaped his identity beyond penitence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight trajectory but relies on abstract logic (petals as instruments of repair feel arbitrary despite poetic framing). The fissure’s resolution is elegant yet lacks visceral stakes, leaving the arc emotionally thin despite structural clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive: the vault’s sterile preservation vs. emotional "warmth," the crack’s impossible blooms, and the swing set’s eerie stillness coalesce into a haunting sensory tapestry. The setting is both literal and symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of mending reality through petal-tracking is inventive, and the interplay of guilt/redemption resonates. However, emotional beats often verge on abstract (e.g., "lovingly hateful") rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality falters in moments of overwrought description ("icy warmth") and slightly generic guilt-as-redemption tropes. However, the fusion of physical containment (jars) and metaphysical danger is fresh and avoids genre clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High cohesion, with elements like the block and vault essential to the narrative. The swing set bookend and "hush" timeframe enhance thematic unity, though some elements (petals) feel more functional than integral.</comment>
