<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's morbid florist identity and pursuit of cosmic understanding are conceptually coherent but lack psychological depth; her transformation is intellectually conveyed but emotionally distant, relying on exposition over experiential character growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lantern-to-candle transition structures the narrative well, but the microcosmic observations feel hastily synthesized into enlightenment without sufficient process; the cosmic arc resolves too abstractly, leaving the "endings as transitions" theme more stated than organically demonstrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative but superficial: floating dojo's zero-gravity botanicals and dying lantern create strong atmosphere, but cosmic cycles remain decorative rather than world-building fundamentals; sensory details impress but lack functional integration with plot or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic imagery ("candle as a beacon within the turn") and cyclical metaphors enrich thematic resonance; however, emotional impact suffers from clinical detachment - the philosophical conclusion feels intellectually satisfying but humanly unrelatable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise weakened by ornate phrasing ("silent, eternal song"); transitions from morbid curiosity to refined understanding lack subtle progression; moments of sharp observation undercut by intermittent abstraction that feels more algorithmically "completing the form" than authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive within constraints but occasionally self-congratulatory in its poetic aspirations; the celestial mechanics-biological decay synthesis shows promise but reads more like an elegant concept sketch than fully realized literary work.</comment>
