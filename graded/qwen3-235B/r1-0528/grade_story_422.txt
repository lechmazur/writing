<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lena’s sudden declaration of family ties feels abrupt rather than organically built. Arlo’s muteness-through-Barnaby is conceptually strong but under-explored—his internal dynamics with the dummy lack emotional nuance. The shift in optimism lacks a visceral emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The parallel universe’s weather phenomena drive the plot but feel episodic. Transitions—storm arrival, Lena’s presence—are abrupt. The ending decision to approach her is emotionally earned but structurally underbuilt within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid, otherworldly sensory details (bioluminescent surf, singing sand) immerse readers, but the setting rarely interrogates or reflects Arlo’s psyche. The twin moons and inverted tides dazzle but rarely deepen his internal stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of archiving the uncanny mirrors Arlo’s outsider status. Lena’s dialogue-as-overheard-revelation cleverly subverts patronization into unexpected solidarity. The theme of alternative familial bonds emerges too late to fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids purple prose in atmospheric descriptions, but Lena’s exposition-laden phone call (“he charts impossible weather…”) feels contrived. The ventriloquist angle subverts voice/agency tropes, though Arlo’s inner life remains opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements (parallel universe, muteness, coffee sleeves) cohere into a surreal yet accessible narrative. The theme of unseen connections lingers, but the brevity limits thematic depth and character complexity.</comment>
