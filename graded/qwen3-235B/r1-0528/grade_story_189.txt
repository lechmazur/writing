<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is driven but generic; motivation is clear yet lacks internal conflict or emotional complexity. "Brazen calm" is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through cause-effect chains, but the tight word limit leaves the resolution feeling compressed. The arc is complete but lacks depth in escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (salt, cold light, whispers), but the "desolate coasts" of the timeframe remain underexplored as a narrative influence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Strong atmosphere and conceptual weight elevate the story, but the ending lacks emotional payoff. Themes of forbidden knowledge are clear but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements like the key and haunted basement show originality, but the "war for water" trope and underexplored character suggest surface-level subversion of clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Cohesive but strained by word count; some elements (e.g., spectral warnings) feel rushed. Conceptual ambition outweighs emotional resonance.</comment>
