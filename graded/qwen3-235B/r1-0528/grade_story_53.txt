<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's impulsivity shapes actions but lacks nuanced inner conflict; motivation is clear but simplicity undermines thematic resonance in such brevity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on familiar epiphany structure; pacing mostly controlled though transitions between emotional beats feel slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like dust motes, cavern howls, and luminous postcards create visceral immersion; setting operates as active metaphor for character's internal state.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Primarily avoids formulaic phrasing but some abstractions ("restless guilt," "mystical reality") lean toward poetic vagueness rather than uniquely specific emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Interconnected elements form cohesive whole; slight unevenness in character depth prevents transcendence, but cosmic subtext lingers beyond final paragraph.</comment>
