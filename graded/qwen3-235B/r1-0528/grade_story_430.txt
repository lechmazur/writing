<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Internal conflict shown through actions like keeping the drawing, but motivations lack layered complexity; emotional nuance feels surface-level despite thematic underpinnings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Moments of cohesion and a clear arc, but the word limit strains the development of pivotal character decisions and the transition to the thematic conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vivid visuals dominate, but underused sensory depth (e.g., flat sound/touch descriptions) weakens full immersion and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and thematic closure work well, though occasional clich√©s (e.g., "taste stardust") undercut originality; subtext elevates the ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unique setting but borrows softened-hardened tropes without subversion; some overwritten phrases ("terrifying, brilliant silence") border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent integration of elements with thematic intent, but lacks the transformative craft or boldness needed for elite-tier publication.</comment>
