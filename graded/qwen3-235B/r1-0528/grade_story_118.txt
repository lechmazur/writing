<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character's assigned 'merry bitterness' and role as hive-mind therapist are present, but internal motivations remain underexplored beyond basic plot function. Motivation to "anchor the ephemeral" lacks psychological complexity despite technical execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a single symbolic act but lacks traditional progression. The self-contained vignette works within word limits, though the absence of character or narrative transformation weakens resolution. Pacing lingers on imagery at the expense of plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere shines through precise sensory details – ozone-tasting adrenaline, metallic chill, flickering candlelight – creating palpable tension. The sterile facility contrasts beautifully with organic wax symbolism, enhancing thematic resonance between clinical control and emotional chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (wax symbols as psychological cartography, electricity as vulnerability) elevate the craft. The ending's fusion of 'sound of hindsight' and physical wax codes creates intellectual resonance, though emotional connection remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-writing pitfalls with fresh imagery (wax that "tasted like copper"), but some phrases ('uniformly peculiar sensation') border on algorithmic abstraction. Emotional nuance exists in subtext rather than explicit telling, though occasional conceptual density risks alienating engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Demonstrates thematic cohesion between impermanence and documentation, but the tight focus sacrifices broader narrative impact. Short length feels intentional yet leaves conceptual elements (hive-mind psychology, espionage implications) underexplored, achieving formal excellence over lasting resonance.</comment>
