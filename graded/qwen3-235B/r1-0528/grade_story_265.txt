<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the deputy's "impassive" nature is shown through minimal actions but lacks psychological depth or evolution, making his singular drive feel archetypal rather than fully human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to a restrained arc (arrival-ritual-revelation-departure) with coherence, but the 500-word limit strains pacing—the sudden shift from ritual to resolution feels compressed, leaving the symbolic beats underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Richly immersive worldbuilding through juxtaposed decay and vitality; sensory details (oil, peach blossoms, crumbling mortar) masterfully align atmosphere with thematic contrasts (mundanity vs. transcendence).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and the bee's dance create visceral emotional impact, but the thematic weight ("grace," "echoes") leans on poetic abstraction at the expense of deeper subtext or moral complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking originality in conceits (orchard in a cathedral, bee-communication ritual) with purposeful language and minimal redundancy; avoids clichés but occasionally prioritizes lyrical precision over emotional rawness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong aesthetic cohesion and thematic resonance, but the brevity occasionally flattens narrative momentum, and certain elements (e.g., cathedral's "sacred bones") risk overfamiliarity despite inventive framing.</comment>
