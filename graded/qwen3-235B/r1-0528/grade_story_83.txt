<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underexplored. Aris' duality as researcher/janitor lacks depth beyond surface setup; his "suspiciously trusting step" feels undercontextualized rather than revealing. The candle-based analysis reveals professional dedication but fails to connect to deeper emotional layers. Final grin hints at personality but lacks narrative throughline.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plotted with structural coherence but constrained by word count. Candle's scientific analysis drives progression, but connection between mirror maze and conclusion feels rushed. Pacing falters during technical descriptions of wick analysis, while key revelations (Draco-lepid confirmation) lack dramatic weight. Logical flow maintained but emotional momentum lost.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on tactile details - plastic tray's scrape against decay, candle as "sacred relic," candlelight vigil imagery. Contrast between autumnal normalcy (leaf raking) and labyrinth dread creates tension. Mirror motif provides visual cohesion, though laboratory decay feels underexploited. Sensory immersion strong but setting's thematic potential only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractured reflections as moral complexity, candle's "story") add depth. Ending connects covert research to societal accountability, but emotional payoff diluted by clinical descriptions. "Seeds" motif ties to theme yet feels stated rather than embodied. Nuanced showing in wick analysis sequence, but some elements (mischievousness) remain unearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mirror labyrinth and candle analysis show ingenuity but risk genre tropes (forbidden lab, cryptids). Writing avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("battered plastic tray like a sacred relic"). Emotional beats stated rather than revealed; transitions between scenes contain logic but lack stylistic uniqueness. Subtler characterization needed for full originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Despite tight word constraints, elements cohere into an exposé narrative. Battered tray and candle particularly well-integrated, though Draco-lepid revelation feels tacked-on rather than organically discovered. Story fulfills basic requirements without transcendent execution, leaving thematic potential partially unrealized in favor of plot mechanics.</comment>
