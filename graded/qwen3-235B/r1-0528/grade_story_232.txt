<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's profession as a physician is underutilized; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced psychological depth. Actions align with obsession but profession feels superfluous.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but the coffee-ground omen-to-tremor progression feels contrived. Pacing uneven in spots due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (green light, vibrating blade), but the digital nomad camp's techno-modern setting clashes awkwardly with mystical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cutlass as cipher, coffee grounds). The ending resolves the central tension elegantly, though thematic depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original setting-choice stands out, but coffee-ground divination and "dire enchantment" feel trope-reliant. Emotional beats often stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack narrative synergy. Some (like the camp) feel decorative rather than foundational. Conceptual bones present but underdeveloped.</comment>
