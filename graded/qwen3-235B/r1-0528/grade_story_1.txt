<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's phobias and stunt double background are present but underdeveloped. Their motivation feels episodic rather than psychologically urgent. Voice has distinct phrases but lacks consistent psychological depth beyond surface anxiety.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot advances through literal progression into pyramid but lacks causal momentum. Knot-untying as climax feels conceptual rather than organically earned. Coherence maintained within word limit but emotional beats are undersold.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the strongest element: oppressive darkness, sensory deprivation, and tactile net details create immersive dread and transcendence. Garage sale opening and pyramid's light shift feel disconnected from this masterfully sustained mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphorical resonance (net as metaphor for fear) elevate the prose. Emotional impact remains limited by thematic overstatement. Ending's "manageable murmurs" phrasing weakens the existential payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive "numb fascination" and "echoes" phrasing feels formulaic. Some fresh juxtapositions (mundane net vs. cosmic awe) but occasional purple prose ("crushing weight of the pyramid") undermines authenticity. Tension between horror and transcendence feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually ambitious but execution prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative coherence. Assigned elements are superficially integrated but lack organic thematic interrelation. Ending lingers, though more through mood than earned meaning.</comment>
