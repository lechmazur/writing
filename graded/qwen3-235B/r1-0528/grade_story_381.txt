<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyra’s dual identity as a necromancer and scholar lacks depth; her necromancy is underused, making her motivation feel functional. Her mentor’s film reference feels tacked on, not organically tied to her character beyond a plot device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mechanical cause-and-effect in resolving phantoms with music weakens tension; the abrupt shift to cinematic nostalgia strains logic. Pacing is tight but relies on contrived resolution rather than earned emotional or thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid crystalline cave imagery creates a haunting, multisensory atmosphere. However, "futuristic nostalgia" clashes with the eerie setting, and the baseball cap’s relevance to the environment lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance through "sonic empathy" as metaphor for understanding vs. domination. The cave as cathedral metaphor and quiet resolution elevate the theme, though some subtext is undercut by expository phantoms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</question><comment>Story avoids genre tropes in premise but occasionally falters in execution (e.g., spectral phantoms, cinematic deus ex machina). Sensory details are lush but occasionally generic; emotional beats lean on cinematic shorthand rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (resonance, nostalgia, mapping) but unevenly drive the narrative. The concept feels conceptually rich but occasionally prioritizes intellectual ideas over organic character/narrative integration.</comment>
