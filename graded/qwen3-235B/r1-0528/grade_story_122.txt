<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's cybernetic traits influence actions but lack emotional depth; motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond stoic determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows tight cause-and-effect, but pivotal shifts (lightning inversion) feel slightly rushed within the word limit despite strong structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory specifics (storm, bones, grinding ceramite) create a vivid but narrowly sensory environment; lacks olfactory/tactile richness to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and metaphor work well, but emotional impact leans more on spectacle than layered subtext; ending feels cathartic but unambiguous.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI markers—unique syntheses (e.g., "cyber-templar," prism/bridle union) shine—but occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction over concrete detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively but occasionally telegraphed; brevity works but some connections (bridle's resonance) strain plausibility under scrutiny.</comment>
