<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's symbolic role resonates, but psychological depth remains underexplored; motivation expressed through plot mechanics rather than fully embodied internal experience</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear symbolic arc exists but pacing feels compressed; pivotal transformations lack incremental buildup needed for emotional resonance within tight constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative environmental details create powerful atmosphere, though setting's thematic connection to character's internal conflict could feel more integrally woven</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uncommon combinations (embroidered curses, generational trauma metaphors) stand out, though emotional beats risk poetic abstraction over human complexity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but execution prioritizes poetics over character-rooted drama; feels more like thematic sketch than realized narrative</comment>
