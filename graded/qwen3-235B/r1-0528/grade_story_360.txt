<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Central idea of meekness as quiet perception is present but underdeveloped; motivation for "decoding universal riddle" told more than shown; character's moment of realization feels more circumstantial than character-driven despite thematic significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean narrative arc within word constraints; loss of sight followed by regained clarity creates satisfying progression; cause-effect chain from broken pen to visionary drop makes internal sense; maintains momentum and closure without rushing resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through sensory details like phosphorescence and contrasting playground sounds, but goblin city setting lacks specificity that would make it indispensable to the narrative's emotional or thematic core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking poetic devices elevate the prose; metaphors are fresh and purposeful; philosophical resolution avoids clich√©; maintains emotional resonance through imagery rather than direct exposition; shows rather than states transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>New angle on revelation through imperfection and smallness rather than grand gestures; avoids formulaic writing; metaphors like pen/dryness aren't derivative; some abstract exposition weakens perceived authenticity slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story achieves thematic unity and emotional impact despite limitations; elements serve purpose without feeling forced, but doesn't transcend into truly distinctive contemporary literary fiction; ideas are compelling but execution stops short of unforgettable profundity.</comment>
