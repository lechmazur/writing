<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s traits inform her actions but lack emotional depth; her transformation feels abrupt rather than earned. The doll’s revelation of vulnerability is compelling but undersubstantiated in her interiority. Her voice lacks distinctness despite evocative narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually cohesive, but pacing strains within the word limit—key emotional beats and the transition to her art creation feel rushed. The concept shapes the arc, but cause-and-effect clarity wavers in the compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting immerses with vivid bioluminescent details and alien stars, effectively tying the bay’s fragility to the theme. Sensory specificity anchors the mood, though the “after FTL” framework remains underexplored beyond narrative justification.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (ephemeral art as theme), emotionally resonant ending, and layered symbolism elevate impact. The “show-don’t-tell” approach works well, though the central conflict remains low-stakes. The theme of transience is potent but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés (bioluminescent art as legacy is inventive) but leans on occasionally elaborate phrasing (“constellations of forgotten myths”) that skirts purple prose. Character nuance is present but occasionally overridden by thematic exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate effectively with the theme, though some (e.g., FTL) feel imposed rather than organic. The story’s brevity serves its focus but limits deeper exploration. Lingering questions about the lost civilization enhance thematic resonance.</comment>
