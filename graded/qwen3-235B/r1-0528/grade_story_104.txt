<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but interiority remains distant; actions align with stoic defiance but psychological depth feels slightly abstracted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot movement is atmospheric rather than causal; the slow burn works for mood but lacks narrative stakes or meaningful progression despite strong vignette-like structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory worldbuilding through resin-dust, bone-smooth cameo, distorted moonlight creates immersive tension between sterile artifice and organic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (scars vs polish, silent rebellion) combines with haunting metaphors (“porcelain rose”) and a theme of truth's fractured beauty that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements create paradoxical tension (secrecy/perfection) that feels purposeful rather than imposed; the miniature world framing device elevates concept cohesion.</comment>
