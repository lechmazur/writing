<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks interiority; tension between Kael's rage and restraint feels forced. Photo-based trauma is effective but emotionally simplistic. Subtlety in suppressed emotions needed refinement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but resolution occurs too swiftly. Effective use of time pressure; however, emotional payoff feels truncated. Secondary control hub's introduction lacks foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crater's edge setting creates visual contrast but underutilizes lunar-specific tensions (radiation, isolation). Atmosphere of artificial Eden vs. desolation works, but sensory details remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery like "phony limb" photograph and "icily certain" dialogue convey layered meaning. The metaphor of artificial vs. natural life adds thematic resonance. Limited dialogue but impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in subverting revenge narrative (protagonist leaves instead of killing). Some over-ornate description ("sterile Eden") and telegraphed emotional beats detract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements work together to create impactful short narrative; brevity enhances tension but limits thematic expansion. Lingering question about power dynamics post-escape elevates memorability.</comment>
