<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly sketched. The sentinel's dry wit manifests superficially through sparse dialogue, but deeper personality exploration is lacking despite the unique premise. The tango connection feels contrived rather than organically tied to his established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight structure in restricted space; tango sequence drives momentum. Pacing falters slightly during spectral transition, but circular connection between confiscation act and knowledge transfer demonstrates narrative economy within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere masterfully woven through tactile details (salt-stained walls, fraying rope, cold hearth). Timeframe's immediacy amplifies spectral tension; setting functions as active character rather than backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional emotional paradox: mechanical precision vs. passionate dance. Subtext about preserving dying traditions through unconventional intimacy resonates. Ending balances mystery with catharsis. Metaphors (tango as knowledge transfer, rope as broken promises) work on multiple levels.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Negative capability in avoiding over-explanation of supernatural logic. Prose remains disciplined despite lush imagery; ghost's motivations slightly underdeveloped but haunting ambiguity serves purpose. Tango's introduction borders on conceptual risk rather than trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive within limitations. Elemental integration sometimes feels aspirational rather than fully realized - the dance mechanic particularly strains plausibility despite thematic elegance. Lingering questions about lighthouse lore suggest narrative depth beyond immediate scope.</comment>
