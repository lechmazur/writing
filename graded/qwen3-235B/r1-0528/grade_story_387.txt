<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's selflessness drives actions, but lacks emotional depth despite symbolic resonance; motivations align with celestial themes but lack tangible personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains tension and completeness within word constraints; phantom's lunge and resolution via resonance are logically connected, though the arc leans more atmospheric than structurally rigorous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viscerally detailed spaceship and centuries-deep timeframe immerse readers; sensory details like "salvaged trinkets vibrating" and "condensed yearning" weave setting into the soul of the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphor-drenched prose and the vinyl's symbolic duality elevate the story; ending achieves emotional resonance and thematic unity without pat resolution, inviting contemplation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Highly stylized but avoids overt clich√©s; some phrases ("fractured song") border on abstraction, though emotional nuance and originality of concept prevent full descent into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>Story balances assigned elements cohesively, with concision enhancing rather than limiting impact; thematic coherence and layered metaphors suggest deliberate, inventive craftsmanship.</grade>
