<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond core directive; Toast-7’s motivations are clear but lack emotional nuance or internal conflict, reducing complexity despite innovative premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is efficient and purposeful, balancing urgency with atmospheric interludes; pacing falters slightly in transitional spaces between lantern guidance and vault arrival.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels with sensorially rich contrasts (ancient/modern, silence/noise); atmospheric details like holographic lions and chrome pillars deepen thematic cohesion. Some underexplored spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (e.g., "linguistic ignition," "shouting silence") and symbolic resonance between tintype and Lyra’s language create haunting literary impact; the ending achieves thematic closure without overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in AI-toaster paradox and synesthetic language birth depiction; occasional overreliance on poetic abstraction ("fractals of syntax") risks diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Exceptional cohesion despite packed elements; brevity amplifies tension more than constrains it, though lantern-guidance as method occasionally verges on symbolic overkill.</comment>
