<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kenji's solitary nature and botanical background shape his actions well, but Aiko's motivation feels implied rather than fully fleshed. The pressed flower book effectively bridges their connection, though the characters' internal transitions rely heavily on suggestion rather than demonstrable growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative progression through small, symbolic gestures maintains coherence within the word limit, but the ending feels abrupt rather than earned. The "repositioning" action drives key plot moments, though thematic weight occasionally outpaces structural momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (lacquered book surfaces, meteor reflections on paper) merge setting and metaphor seamlessly. The reimagined castle as both historical and artistic space enhances atmosphere, with weather patterns mirroring emotional states effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical interplay between fragile flora and transient celestial events creates lingering resonance. The unspoken communication method elevates the text beyond mere melancholy, though occasional lyrical excesses slightly dilute emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through specific intersections of botany and astronomy, but risk-averse phrasing ("whispering of fates") occasionally surfaces. Sensory details remain precise without veering into artificial elaboration, maintaining stylistic control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize thematically but occasionally prioritize poetic cohesion over narrative tension. The castle's transformation remains more symbolic than functional, and brevity sacrifices certain emotional payoffs while preserving atmospheric integrity.</comment>
