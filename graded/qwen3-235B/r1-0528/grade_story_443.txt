<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but remains abstract through excessive symbolic abstraction, sacrificing deeper emotional resonance; actions align thematically but lack visceral psychological specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc exists but pacing stumbles in compressed word limit; cause-effect progression feels contrived in seed-to-library sequence despite strong thematic throughline between opening and closing scythe imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through synesthetic details like "petrified wood scent" and "cascading moss," though twilight setting's metaphysical implications could be more rigorously explored to avoid ethereal vagueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors and lyrical precision create strong thematic impact, but occasionally lapses into ornamental abstraction; subtext about imperfection as authenticity is compelling yet unevenly embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through novel combinations (reaper-mourning creativity), but some "softly thunderous" echoes suggest formulaic phrasing; emotional progression relies too heavily on poetic juxtaposition rather than earned character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements technically cohere but create artificial symmetry; brevity sacrifices organic complexity; emotional payoff feels prematurely resolved rather than lingering ambiguously.</comment>
