<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the softheartedness is tied to his motivation, Aris remains an archetypal figure with limited interiority beyond his cosmic purpose. His actions align with his traits, but psychological depth is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong through-line between stabilizing the city and the planetarium ritual, but the climactic "sigil" moment lacks buildup, making the resolution feel abrupt despite the story's atmospheric pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imagery-rich cyberpunk decay is offset by the planetarium’s haunting stillness, creating effective contrast. Sensory details (neon rain, bioluminescent light) immerse readers, though some descriptors lean toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance (mycelium, celestial harmonics) elevates the narrative, evoking themes of fragile hope. The ending’s subtlety rewards reflection, though emotional intimacy lags slightly behind conceptual ambition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh subversion of "chosen one" tropes via understated actions and cosmic symbology. Avoids melodrama; metaphors avoid overused sci-fi/fantasy clichés. A few phrases like "fractured light" risk abstraction over originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified vision of quiet salvation. The brevity works for a poetic vignette but leaves nuances of the city’s transformation underexplored, slightly weakening thematic payoff.</comment>
