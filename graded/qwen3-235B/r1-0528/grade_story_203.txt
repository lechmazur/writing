<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is palpable, but motivations are hinted rather than fully explored within the tight word limit. The inheritance of lies shapes his actions effectively, though the rushed resolution feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but strained; symbolic drowning via submersion in a play-bubble is inventive. Pacing is uneven, with critical decisions feeling abrupt despite logical cause-effect chains. The arc is compressed but not incoherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting is rendered with visceral, haunting sensory details. Atmosphere of isolation and cosmic dread amplifies the character's desperation. The humid, childlike sanctuary contrasts effectively with the void.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling wields striking metaphors ("cold intelligence born of cosmic indifference") and emotional resonance. The theme of flawed courage subverting inherited inadequacy is poignant. Ending’s thematic payoff overrides narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagining exorcism rituals and the entity’s nature. Avoids formulaic horror tropes. Some elevated prose borders on ornate, but emotional beats are shown through gestures (trembling hands, pressed flowers), not merely stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively despite brevity; the story’s emotional core transcends structural constraints. Themes of self-doubt and defiance linger, though some connections feel perfunctory.</comment>
