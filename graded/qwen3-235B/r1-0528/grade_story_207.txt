<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like 'forthright' and 'meekly assertive' remain underexplored, though the blood oath and flower bouquet provide clear motivation. The protagonist's actions serve the plot more than his personality, limiting deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but feels compressed; the transition from research to revelation hinges on a single throwaway line that undercuts the buildup of guilt. While the beginning/end connection is clear, the middle lacks tension scaling proportional to the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Phrases like 'joyful loneliness' and 'fragile step on redemption's path' lean toward poetic abstraction over human specificity. Logical character reasoning (e.g., sifting methods) works, but emotional beats often get stated rather than earned through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Despite solid atmospheric cohesion, the story struggles with balancing assigned elements. The oath revelation feels narratively efficient but emotionally thin; the brief format works thematically but sacrifices visceral engagement with Kael's transformation.</comment>
