<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara's duality as wreck-diver/ghost-whisperer is hinted but underdeveloped; motivation to "step from her grandfather's shadow" is clear but could use more visceral inner conflict</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently from stasis to spectral encounter to emotional resolution; solstice timing ties beginning/middle/end tightly, though ghost release feels slightly abrupt despite atmospheric buildup</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Decaying carnival details (cracked ducks, neon echoes, cotton candy scent) create richly tactile melancholia; amber's warmth/ghost's neon glow contrast effectively with derelict environment</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exquisite use of metaphor (amber as "golden time," spectral voice "like rustling tickets"); emotional truth emerges through specific sensory engagement rather than outright declaration</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unexpected juxtaposition (carnival spirits vs maritime ghosts); some phrases ("whispered to souls") border on familiar territory but are redeemed by tactile specificity</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion despite constraint; letter framing device, amber motif, and cyclical tradition create resonant circularity; emotional payoff feels earned, not manufactured</comment>
