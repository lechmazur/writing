<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's symbolic role is vivid but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear yet remains abstract without personal stakes or inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence centered on a singular ritual but lacks dynamic progression; the arc is resolved but static, which suits its thematic focus but risks monotony.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is a visceral extension of the theme; sensory details (e.g., "skeletal branches," "crimson poppies") create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that amplifies the hermit's defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Potent metaphors ("translate destruction into creation") and lyrical prose evoke emotional weight; the ending resonates thematically but avoids sentimentality, balancing "showing" and "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the weathervane-comet ritual but veers close to poetic abstraction; avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans on lush descriptors that border on indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole; the hermit's act transcends the scenario to imply broader existential struggle, though its brevity prioritizes mood over narrative complexity.</comment>
