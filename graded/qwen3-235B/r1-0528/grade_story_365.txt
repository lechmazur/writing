<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear (rewriting history) but psychological complexity feels abstract; emotional contradictions remain surface-level despite vivid descriptions of physical actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Momentum exists through ritualistic action but structural coherence buckles under the weight of excessive abstraction; cause-effect logic feels strained by the nebulous mechanics of time-weaving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery in decayed carnival imagery creates immersive melancholy; subconscious realm integration feels organic though occasionally overwritten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on elaborate simile over original metaphor, repetitive "shimmering/glowing" descriptors; tone teeters on edge of poetic lushness vs. baroque overload.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Technical cohesion achieved through elemental integration but at high cost of emotional immediacy; succeeds as concept-art but resonates weakly as human narrative.</comment>
