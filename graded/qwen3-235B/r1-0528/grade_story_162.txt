<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blueprint fragment drives urgency but cause-effect logic between island memories and device completion remains murky; ending feels truncated despite structural scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Workshop atmosphere excels through tactile details (ozone, unspooled tapes) but island memories remain abstract, diluting emotional weight of memory manipulation stakes.</comment>
