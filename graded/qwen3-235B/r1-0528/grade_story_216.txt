<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's role as scapegoat lacks psychological depth beyond surface descriptions of "numbness" and borrowed guilt; motivations primarily stem from plot devices rather than organic human logic; reactions to the washer and symbols feel imposed by narrative convenience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through symbolic catalyst (washer/symbols), but structural momentum compromised by compressed revelations; critical connections (elite's deception, city collapse) feel rushed, sacrificing nuanced development for dramatic payoff in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cloud city setting features precise sensory details (obsidian desk, celestial alignment), yet atmospheric tension underdeveloped; the "doomed prison" conclusion leans on thematic shorthand rather than earned emotional resonance through environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (washer as key/aperture, scapegoat revelation) elevates thematic impact; some heavy-handed exposition about "borrowed identities" dilutes subtler psychological layers; ending achieves haunting ambiguity but risks oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt cliche through innovative integration of washer symbol/technology but indulges in AI-adjacent tendencies (overly precise descriptors: "robustly delicate," "inexplicable solidity"); emotional states occasionally stated rather than dramatized; tone remains consistent despite layered conceptual complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively while occasionally feeling predetermined (e.g., midnight telecom calls as narrative convenience); brevity enhances urgency but diminishes character stakes; lingering thematic questions about guilt/complicity are impactful but surface-level.</comment>
