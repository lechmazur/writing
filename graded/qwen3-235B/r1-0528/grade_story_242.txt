<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and actions are mostly coherent, but her transformation feels slightly compressed; the herbs as symbolic guides are well-integrated, though her voice lacks distinctiveness in the largely third-person-omniscient narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The courier chase tightly drives the plot, with logical cause-effect; the ending feels purposeful despite the tight word count, though the initial setup leans slightly exposition-heavy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich, sensory-driven worldbuilding (e.g., "jars of captured laughter," "sterile smell of data wipes") masterfully contrasts preservation and erasure, enhancing theme and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical yet precise, with layered metaphors and subtextual tension; the ending’s "hum of cultural memory" resonates thematically, though some imagery risks slight overwroughtness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original concept with evocative phrasing, but some descriptors ("desert sands" for shifting loyalties) feel familiar; emotions shown through sensory details rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion and thematic resonance despite layered elements; the brief runtime is used effectively, though integration of the "mirthful solemnity" feels underexplored.</comment>
