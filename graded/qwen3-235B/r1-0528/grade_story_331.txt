<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clearly motivated but inner conflict feels underdeveloped; emotional subtext remains surfacelevel despite strong conceptual framework.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong premise and resolution, but quantum mechanics-as-magic framework creates plot convenience; pacing strained by ambitious scope in limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Breathless descriptive richness creates immersive atmosphere; quantum garden's physics inconsistently applied but emotionally resonant imagery compensates.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphoric layering (music-box-as-future-writing, entanglement-as-memory); theme of cultural preservation through quantum defiance transcends literal plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some strikingly fresh combinations (quantum physics + spirituality) undercut by formulaic "last-protector-of-lost-world" tropes and occasionally self-indulgent lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Extraordinary tonal consistency across surreal elements; structure struggles to contain complex metaphysical concepts within constrained format but maintains conceptual integrity.</comment>
