<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict lacks depth; the plastic clip reveals her dual role effectively, though broader personality remains underexplored beyond functional determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates tight cause-and-effect with logical progression, though the compressed word count strains resolution nuance; beginning-middle-end structure resolves through deliberate, coherent actions despite limited space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery-rich setting contrasts beautifully with concept (chlorophyll dreams vs. banal restaurant), but wedding toasts and timeframe feel underutilized as atmospheric devices rather than intentional tonal contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic destruction of the clip create memorable impact; ending balances tragedy with hope, though broader thematic exploration of "fragile hope" remains surface-level despite strong emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps but occasionally leans on overdetermined symbolism ("lead-shielded glass") and somewhat generic "burden of knowledge" trope; emotional subtext relies more on imagery than raw exposition, though some passages verge on ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically around fragility of creation/concealment; slight artificiality in element integration (wedding noise, overly neat symbolism) prevents highest marks, though ending resonates as deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
