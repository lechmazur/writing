<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Leo's digital-age dissatisfaction is clear but underdeveloped; his "eager lookout" trait lacks integration beyond observational sharpness, and the emotional depth between his motivation and actions feels thinly sketched despite pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structural coherence exists between discovery and resolution, but the cleaning timeframe introduces tension unevenly – the poltergeist's "language" decoding feels accelerated, and the sudden shift from chaos to calm lacks visceral progression within the tight limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory textures (dust devils, humming wood) build atmosphere, but the reimagined Roman villa's historical specifics remain superficial; the "eco-retreat" detail feels decorative rather than thematically embedded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The metaphor of threads across time resonates, and "ruthless kindness" as a paradoxical approach offers conceptual weight. However, emotional impact is undercut by underdeveloped psychological stakes – the connection feels more intellectual than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with the "psychic echo" framing; language remains lean despite some overwrought phrases ("whispers hissed on the edge of hearing"). The sewing box's organic materials as energetic anchor feels fresh, though the digital-age framing leans slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Storytelling coheres despite tight constraints, with most elements serving both plot and theme. The narrative's brevity occasionally strains logical flow (e.g., immediate poltergeist activation upon touching box), and the eco-retreat premise feels like window dressing rather than ecological commentary.</comment>
