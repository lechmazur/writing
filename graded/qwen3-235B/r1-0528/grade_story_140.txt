<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo’s guilt and fractured psyche are clear but lack layered exploration; motivations tied to redemption are consistent but feel surface-level. The doll’s symbolism is effective, but emotional depth remains tethered to melancholic tropes without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is concise but mostly coherent, with a clear arc from stagnation to release. The planetarium encounter risks feeling abrupt, but the resolution ties to the opening effectively, balancing tight word constraints against necessary emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully crafted—the abandoned circus’s decay, the planetarium’s cosmic clarity, and the “suspiciously sweet” scent merge sensory and thematic resonance. Each element bolsters mood and subtext with evocative, immersive details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Thematic coherence and symbolic depth elevate the story, blending cosmic metaphor with intimate trauma. The ending resonates emotionally without melodrama, though some internal monologue edges toward generalized lyricism instead of earning every cathartic beat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Occasional generic descriptors (“haunted,” “tortured”) and overly ornate similes (“playful glimmer like starlight on sequins”) undercut originality. The doll’s mystical release avoids being overly trope-bound, but uneven prose polish weakens the overall impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Cohesion wavers: the planetarium and “dawn’s second breath” feel slightly shoehorned, yet the doll’s centrality and theme of fractured redemption unify the narrative enough to leave a lingering emotional echo.</comment>
