<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (sculpting a new tomorrow) is hinted through actions but lacks visceral emotional grounding; internal world of the tailor remains underexplored, with restlessness sometimes feeling like surface trait rather than defining psychological force</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from mystery to revelation effectively, though the sudden transition to the botanist’s salvation feels slightly compressed; ephemeral cameos as clues work narratively but risk over-explanation in the final twist</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Martian biodome atmosphere is vivid (ozone scent, failing systems, Martian regolith patches), but worldbuilding occasionally skims fantastical plausibility; sensory details excel in claustrophobic claustrophobia but could better integrate with thematic weight</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lantern as metaphor for rediscovered hope is potent; closing juxtaposition of mending books vs. saving lives elevates craft; pacing favors lyrical ambiguity over tension, slightly blunting emotional impact</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases (e.g., "cautious abandon") repeat like thematic anchors rather than organic elements; subtext about isolation vs. connection is strong but occasionally overwritten; avoids major AI clichés but shows moments of rhythmic predictability</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uses all elements cohesively but unevenly; the tailor’s profession could more explicitly inform the botanist’s repair metaphor; ends with thematic resonance but feels slightly engineered rather than organic</comment>
