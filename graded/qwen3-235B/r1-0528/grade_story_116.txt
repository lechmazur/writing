<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract archetype rather than a psychologically complex figure; motivations are poetically stated but lack visceral emotional texture or relatable interiority; assigned attribute of 'dismayed' shapes tone more than concrete behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot functions as a thematic mosaic rather than traditional arc; excavation-by-photos method creates structural cohesion despite minimal event; beginning/middle/end implied through conceptual progression rather than dramatized change; slight narrative drift in middle sections</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is immersive through sensory overload (jasmine's fragrance, velvet textures, visual contrasts) but risks overshadowing character; sky-lounge-as-metaphor occasionally undermines environmental logic; timelessness suits theme but sacrifices grounding specificity</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prose achieves rare synthesis of lyricism and thematic heft; metaphors (archaeology of emotion, emotional meridians) are conceptually daring; ending resonates as philosophical payoff rather than mere resolution; emotional states emerge through precise imagery rather than direct statement</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in concept and metaphor but occasionally veers into baroque abstraction; avoids genre tropes while flirting with poetic cliché ("laconic exuberance" risks vagueness); sensory details often transcend generic through specific combinations; metaphors feel fresher than similes; emotional register remains intellectually filtered rather than raw</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration variable – some (watch band, excavation, photos) integral to thematic architecture, others feel decorative; style's intensity risks obscuring narrative purpose; word limit used effectively for fragmentary structure; leaves intellectual rather than emotional resonance</comment>
