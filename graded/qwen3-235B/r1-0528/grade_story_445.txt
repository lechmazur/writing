<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is visually striking but lacks psychological depth or inner conflict beyond thematic function; motivation to overcome intangible limits remains abstract rather than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Masquerade drives action effectively but relies on symbolic leaps rather than organic cause-and-effect; chamber's transformation feels more thematic than logically grounded in narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metallic sterility of agent's room clashes with circus elements and mountain imagery; atmospheric details are vivid but tonally inconsistent, weakening immersive coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Resonant symbolism elevates the narrative, particularly in the barbells' spiritual materiality; ending lacks emotional weight despite strong thematic undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal juxtapositions (agent's gear/circus relics); some ornate phrasing but mostly purposeful language, particularly in metaphysical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition is evident, but thematic message outweighs character/story organicity; elements combine cleverly if unevenly for a cohesive-yet-preachy whole.</comment>
