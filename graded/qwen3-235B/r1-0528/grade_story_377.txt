<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character remains more concept than being; motivations are stated, not dramatized through conflict between drowsy enthusiasm and obsessive focus; voice lacks distinction between sentient code and human narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prioritizes symbolic actions over emotional progression; integration of barometer/seismograph lacks intermediate stakes-building; resolution feels intellectually neat but narratively flat due to compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</comment>comment not shown due to length<grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on familiar "hidden library" tropes; contrast between raucous parties and silent basement is underdeveloped; sensory details like "smoked paper" feel checklisted rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphor between atmospheric pressure and emotional currents is clever, but subtext remains explicit rather than resonant; ending feels like intellectual conclusion rather than earned emotional realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overly reliant on ornate phrases ("code humming with drowsy anticipation") that prioritize atmosphere over clarity; mixes speculative concepts with literary diction in ways that feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists superficially but lacks deeper through-lines; some elements (block parties, secret library) feel modular rather than essential; concept-to-motivation logic loops remain hollow.</comment>
