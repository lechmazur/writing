<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation (promise to Elara) is clear but thinly explored; Silas' apothecary background lacks integration beyond the highlighter pen; emotional stakes are stated rather than deeply embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but relies on compressed exposition; the transition to Morse code solution feels abrupt despite thematic preparation; resolution hinges on butterfly behavior that strains credulity even in this speculative context.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid tactile details (stained brass, "crushing indigo depths") and mechanical tension; time pressure of "broken treaties" adds geopolitical texture without mawkishness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The metaphor of light-as-love resonates, but emotional impact is diluted by melodramatic phrasing ("crushing pressure," "force as persistent as butterflies thriving in the crushing deep"); the ending's thematic payoff feels rehearsed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in fusing bioluminescent biology with Morse code; stumbles with overripe phrases ("steampunk leviathan," "living telegraph wire") and a climactic conceit (butterflies as signal amplifiers) that prioritizes poeticism over plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric vignette but falters as high literature; elements function as both set dressing and narrative engines, though the brevity prevents thematic maturation.</comment>
