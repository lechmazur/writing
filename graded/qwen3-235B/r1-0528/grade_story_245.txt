<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation from betrayal, but emotional depth thin despite poetic introspection; chopstick fixation and tea ritual hint at layered grief but lack contextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Linear momentum sustained through jogging-as-metaphor; tea leaf revelation feels contrived but functional, arc culminates in shifted resolve. Pacing occasionally stalls for atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desolate, post-industrial decay vividly contrasts with yearning for natural waterfalls; sensory details (crackling concrete, bitter taste) reinforce thematic tension. Atmosphere is story's strongest asset.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("roar to drown treachery") and symbolic objects deepen resonance; ending implies circularity but lacks philosophical or emotional payoff beyond vengeful resolve.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in favor of introspective grit, but occasional melodrama ("metallic tang," "heart's revolt") undermines subtlety. Nuanced emotion exists but occasionally told rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements are meticulously woven into symbolic logic; the story's tight construction belies its brevity, leaving lingering questions about redemption through ritual.</comment>
