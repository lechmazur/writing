<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear through symbolic actions and internal conflict, but psychological depth remains surface-level despite evocative gestures; motivations align with actions but lack nuanced emotional layering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is tightly managed within constraints, with cause and effect logically connected, though the climax feels slightly rushed; the beginning-to-end arc holds despite compactness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory specificity (tide’s sorting, phial’s sourness), but deeper integration of setting with thematic undertones is unevenly exploited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elevates tropes through original metaphors and textured sensory details; some phrasing leans into ornate description but avoids full detachment from narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive fusion of assigned elements sustains a lean, meaningful narrative; theme of self-reinvention emerges organically but lacks a final emotional punch.</comment>
