<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through decisions weighted by consequences. The rebellious attribute remains abstract concept rather than defining behavioral pattern.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves with elegant cause-effect (mask acquisition→harmonic manifestation), but the labyrinth concept's thematic weight exceeds its structural function. Resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Breathtaking atmosphere created through synesthetic descriptions of resonance-as-light (dust/glow/vibration), though revolution's "crackling energy" remains atmospheric backdrop rather than integrated narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness of harmony confronting chaos through sonic alchemy elevates beyond spectacle. The mask's sentient empathy and organ-as-vessel metaphor create enduring resonance, though emotional beats sometimes default to abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Language occasionally slips into "labyrinth of choices" clichés and precious constructions ("electric tides"), but the conceptual fusion of obituary-writing as rebellion against existential void shows genuine inventiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion achieved through harmonic motifs, but tighter integration needed between "choices" framework and ultimate transcendence. Ending's symbolic victory lacks material consequences.</comment>
