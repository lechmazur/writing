<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths in Silas' artistic frustration vs. servitude, but motivation lacks emotional layering. Reactions to glasses reveal backstory but feel underdeveloped. Actions align with motivation yet lack visceral desperation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot uses car wash ritual effectively for disappearance but struggles with condensing cause-effect. The sunbeam method lacks explanatory logic, and closure feels abrupt despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lunar base atmosphere is immersive through sensory dust/light details and oppressive tone. Connection between setting and core concept weakened by underexplored "intrigue" elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glasses as symbolism and the final image resonate emotionally. Metaphors (e.g., "tiny stars" of dust) elevate craft. Undermined slightly by overtly stated emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in combining artistry with sci-fi escapism, but "whispered secrets" trope and dramatic light effects border on clich√©d. Subtlety in Thorne's duality adds nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some (e.g., intricate light choreography) strain credibility. Emotional punch survives brevity, but subtext remains undercooked.</comment>
