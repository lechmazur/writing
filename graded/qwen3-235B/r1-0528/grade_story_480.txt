<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped. The use of "indifferent enthusiasm" as a personality trait lacks emotional depth despite shaping Silas' interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has strong inciting incident but ends mid-arc with weak resolution. Pacing suits the word count but sacrifices narrative closure, leaving the central conflict unresolved in a way that feels incomplete rather than deliberate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Environments are vividly rendered with sensory details, though setting's connection to core concepts feels superficial. The decrepit mess hall creates evocative atmosphere but doesn't deepen thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective paradoxical language ("quietly loud") and metaphors enhance impact, though emotional resonance relies partially on stated motivations rather than subtext. Memorable voice occasionally verges on affectation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise avoids overt clich√©s but contains moments of stylized phrasing that distance readers. Shows ingenuity in framing digital voyeurism as modern exorcism while occasionally leaning on urban decay tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive narrative with polished prose, but lacks transcendent thematic complexity. Functions well as genre fiction that suggests potential for deeper exploration without delivering fully realized literary merit.</comment>
