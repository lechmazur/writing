<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but emotional depth feels imposed rather than organically revealed. The knight’s transformation lacks layered interiority, relying on grand epiphanies that outpace psychological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot arc is conceptually complete but pacing stumbles between poetic passages and narrative progression. The resolution hinges on abstract revelation rather than action, straining the word limit’s constraint on emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven—floating library and faded booth create strong initial imagery, yet sensory details cluster superficially rather than weaving consistently into the character’s lived experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Storytelling succeeds through lyrical metaphors and thematic resonance, though some phrasing borders on ornate abstraction. The closing theme of "miraculous ordinary" lingers, earning emotional authenticity despite occasional tell-over-show tendencies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Navigates clichés skillfully—mythic library, knight’s redemption—by inverting expectations (e.g., miracles as constant, not rare). Language remains vivid without veering into self-indulgence, though the "joyful agony" motif risks overtheorizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist without fully interweaving—fortuneteller booth feels tacked-on, and the booth’s notations lack narrative urgency. The premise’s ambition outpaces its tight execution, leaving thematic threads unresolved.</comment>
