<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weak voice and inconsistent motivation; the protagonist's blend of bravado and existential purpose feels partially realized, undercut by convenient backstory reveals about the blood drive encounter.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cohesive tension but structurally uneven; reliance on exposition about the Van der Luydens' "unseen burdens" interrupts momentum, while the unresolved haunting creates ambiguity that reads as lazy rather than poetic within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory layering—from the "cavernous foyer's chill" to the "cloyingly sweet" botanical odor—constructs an oppressive, otherworldly atmosphere that overpowers narrative weaknesses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("shadows coalesced like ink in water") supports psychological unease; ending lacks catharsis but intentionally maintains thematic resonance about silent complicity in elite spaces.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional overwriting ("color bleeds from day into night") clashes with effective details; subverts horror tropes by making the haunting a metaphor for social inequality but leans on haunted mansion clichés without reinvention.</comment>
