<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters are atmospheric constructs rather than psychologically fleshed beings; Aris's motivation feels lofty but insufficiently earned through concrete action, while the protagonist remains a passive vessel for sensory experiences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on cosmic resonance harvesting but lacks narrative momentum; blackout-triggered event feels abrupt, the central action of energy capture occurs through vague crystal devices, and the ending resolves without meaningful consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery through tactile fog descriptions, phantom pressure of silence, and luminous crystalline technology - the setting becomes an active participant that transforms mundane commuter liminality into mythic territory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visceral energy transference sequences create haunting physicality through "bone-rattling screaming silence"; poetic juxtaposition of agony/ekstasis elevates the genre elements into metaphysical territory, though philosophical underpinnings remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages transcend formula, but recurring cosmic horror inflection ("tectonic vibration," "earth's hidden voice") borders on mannerism; emotional extremes feel diagrammed rather than organically experienced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition overwhelms structural discipline; atmospheric cohesion cannot fully compensate for elliptical character logic or the thematic vagueness surrounding preservation vs exploitation, though the quantum intimacy of shared resonance harvesting lingers.</comment>
