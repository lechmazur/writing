<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arlo's grief and resolve are emotionally resonant but lack nuanced development; motivations are clear (loss, hope) yet underexplored. The chain as a physical symbol of absence is effective, but his transition to rebellion feels abruptly resolved without deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from quiet contemplation to collective catharsis. The meteor shower as a catalyst is logical, but the midday-to-night pacing compresses emotional beats, slightly undercutting the transformation's impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust motes, chain’s coolness) create a mournful, poetic atmosphere. The scientific poetry library’s blend of logic and artistry enriches the tone, but the mining town’s collapse is underdeveloped as a setting element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery (meteor trails as lifelines, grief as a dirge) elevates the narrative. The ending’s silence-to-wonder is poignant, and the theme of fragile hope is subtle yet universal. Dialogue is minimal but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in framing rebellion as passive stargazing; avoids melodrama. Some phrases (“echo of quiet”) veer into abstraction, and emotional resonance relies partly on stated feelings rather than fully shown reactions.</comment>
