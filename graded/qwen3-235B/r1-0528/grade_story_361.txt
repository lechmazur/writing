<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s traits inform actions (mechanical intuition + cultural preservation), but lacks internal conflict; motivations are clear but underdeveloped emotionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear structure works for short form, but lacks tension/resolution depth; ends abruptly without lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</comment>Strong sensory contrasts (neon vs. decay), but some elements (e.g., dice) feel under-connected to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Potent symbolism and themes, but overreliance on abstract phrases (“soul-fire”) dilutes emotional resonance; subtext is unevenly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Concepts are original but occasionally lean on clichéd juxtapositions (“soul vs. machine”); prose sometimes veers into ornate abstraction without payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but depth suffers under word constraints; the ending feels like a stopping point, not a culmination.</comment>
