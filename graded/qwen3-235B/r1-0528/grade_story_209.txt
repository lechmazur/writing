<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Emotional arc is present but relies heavily on stated grief rather than gradual reveal through actions; woodsman's professions don't strongly inform his behaviors or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear resolution but pacing stumbles; the electricity surge feels contrived rather than logically integrated; the abrupt emotional epiphany lacks sufficient narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements like humming antennas and corroded junction boxes create visceral unease, but the "radio wave garden" exists as a vague metaphor rather than fully realized environment with physical rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (echo as grief, short-circuit as emotional breakdown) elevates the narrative; the physicality of the hairbrush as a love relic creates profound emotional resonance through persistent, unspoken significance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative language occasionally veers into self-indulgence ("despairing cheer, a brittle smile forced over profound loss"); metaphors fresh but some phrasing ("tight knot of performative cheer") borders on overcooked abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weave of elements mostly convincing but strained; the water tower's dual role as geographic feature and psychological metaphor feels forced; the assigned components function but lack organic interconnection.</comment>
