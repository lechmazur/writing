<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arlo's attention to detail as an orchardist credibly informs his investigative skills, but his grief remains superficially rendered beyond occasional references. The wife's inheritance (antique seal) ties motivation to plot but lacks emotional depth beyond thematic convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coincidences (recognizing obscure peacock pattern, immediate access to matching seal) strain plausibility. Sabotage resolution unfolds logically but feels compressed. Ending ties together effectively despite rushed character motivation transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unlikely juxtaposition of apple orchardist in high-tech facility creates cognitive dissonance. Sensory details (crunching gravel, wax impressions) work, but industrial setting lacks distinctive atmosphere beyond generic "sterile hum." Motif of fragility connects to theme but feels forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (grieving mind "sharpened into cold blade," justice as "tart apple") elevate theme beyond plot mechanics. The parallel between natural patterns and human malice possesses poetic resonance. Subtext about fragility vs. control compellingly layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>No overt purple prose or clich√©s, but some mechanical emotional rendering ("black satisfaction" telegraphs reaction). The peacock-seal connection feels human-crafted. Occasional heavy-handedness ("orchardist's sharp eyes") but mostly avoids AI formulae through specific imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements serve plot mechanics but lack deeper integration. The orchardist profession and volunteering timeframe function adequately rather than organically. The sardonic tone feels imposed rather than earned. Ending lands thematically but relies excessively on symbolic convenience.</comment>
