<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's naivety is evident but underdeveloped; her arc resolves abruptly without fully exploring her emotional depth beyond a singular moment of revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves coherence within tight constraints, but the commercial-break urgency feels undercontextualized, creating a slightly artificial tension scaffold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phenomenal sensory layering (virtual flames, paradoxical warmth) creates immersive atmosphere; however, the vault's conceptual richness outpaces narrative integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphoric language (e.g., "golden connection weaving," "listening dark") elevates thematic resonance; emotional subtext emerges organically through poetic, rather than explicit, construction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original handling of magical realism tropes, particularly time compression between commercials; some overly ornate phrases threaten to tip into purple prose but never fully undermine authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements combine with purposeful strangeness; while individual components (virtual flames, commercial break pacing) risk avant-garde dissonance, their collective weight creates transcendent thematic unity.</comment>
