<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bare minimums of motivation met, but Leo's jadedness feels like shorthand rather than a lived-in trait. Brother's sacrifice lacks emotional weight through underdeveloped shared history. The bloodstained scalpel connects to his quest but fails to evoke deeper character introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics click coherently—receipt doodles mapping global locations create satisfying reveal. Timeline compression works against narrative flow—fireworks-as-deadline gimmick forces urgency without organic stakes. Resolutions align with set-ups but lack emotional payoff within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zestfully rendered lab with ozone tang and fluorescent chills creates vivid tension between scientific sterility and whiskey-soaked desperation. Fireworks' sonic punctuations and glowing crystals cleverly mirror plot urgency. Minor details like "dusty lab journal" feel underutilized for atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("crumbling cynicism," "crystals painted in violent hues") elevate tension. Theme of obsession-as-antidote-to-impotence resonates beyond simple revenge narrative. Helix/shard symbol operates as potent corporate malfeasance motif. Ending leaves cerebral rather than visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through unexpected methods (receipt cartography) and specific moral conflict (bio-crystals as corporate weapon). Slight creaks in structure—over-reliance on receipts-as-McGuffins strains credibility. "Jagged shard" trope slightly dulls originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story achieves surprising narrative completeness within constraints. Element integration is purposeful despite occasional contrivance (how did bartender obtain global receipts?). Lingering questions about bio-crystal mechanics suggest deliberate thematic gaps rather than oversight.</comment>
