<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's wistful pragmatism is clear but lacks emotional depth; motivation drives plot but internal logic of his obsession remains underexplored. Dialogue reveals focus but not deeper psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc within constraints; action of browsing directly propels narrative. Mental overlay of canvases strains credibility slightly, but resolution satisfyingly closes the discovery loop without rushing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marketplace offers basic sensory texture but fails to distinguish itself as specifically Roman beyond generic descriptors (spices, livestock). Atmosphere supports quest tone but doesn't deepen thematic connections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong craftsmanship in evocative metaphors ("contained star," "ghosts of creation") and layered subtext about art as hidden knowledge. Ending resonates emotionally through physicalized warmth and silenced mockery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original method (paint smudge cartography) subverts expectations. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction ("chaotic throng"). Nuanced handling of emotion via bodily reactions (palpable warmth) over tells.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements present and interlocked, though some (setting) remain utilitarian. Short length heightens narrative focus but lacks space for fuller atmospheric development. Conceptual themes linger post-reading.</comment>
