<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are clearly differentiated and their motivations drive the plot, but their internal development is somewhat compressed by the word limit, making shifts in perspective feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is mostly effective but relies heavily on familiar quest-structure beats; the rapid resolution of their partnership feels underdeveloped despite functional cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually evocative but atmospheric elements lean on familiar fantasy tropes (luminous swamp, crumbling relics); environmental storytelling lacks deeper integration with character themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of contrast between characters' voices and a resonant theme of questioning authority; emotional payoff of Alistair's transformation lands well within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some generic phrasing (“visions of forgotten histories”) and archetypal roles; avoids major clichés through specific details like “Heartmoss” but occasionally relies on formulaic setups.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of elements with mechanical cohesion, but lacks transformative innovation; emotional resonance is present without reaching profound complexity.</comment>
