<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but the "graceful swordsman" trait remains purely ornamental, lacking functional role in actions or emotional landscape. Interiority is insufficient to fully convey nuanced struggle with individuality vs. conformity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chronological progression holds together well, but the transition from signal discovery to leviathan awakening feels slightly rushed despite effective cause-effect logic. Some narrative compression risks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric density through precise sensory details: liquid-light waterfalls, pressure-choked bioluminescence, and the eerie juxtaposition of synthetic bird songs against abyssal silence create immersive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant prose contains rich metaphors and existential subtext about freedom vs. consequence. The ending leaves haunting questions rather than neat resolution, effectively provoking deeper reflection on ambition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates strong authorial voice through lyrical but disciplined prose. Avoids AI-generated repetition while maintaining originality in combining "grace" with scientific obsession, though some phrases approach ornamental excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically resonant whole. The underwater garden's contradictions – beauty/decay, escape/threat – feel purposeful rather than contrived, with economic use of space in this brief narrative.</comment>
