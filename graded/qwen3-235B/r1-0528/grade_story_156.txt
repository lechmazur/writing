<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characterization is introspective and thematically purposeful but lacks concrete actions aligning with nuanced motivations; the diplomat's internal conflict is well-established, while specific behaviors tied to his "decentralized" approach feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progression follows a clear emotional arc of realization, but the bird motif resolves tension too neatly without fully earned narrative stakes; the compressed structure sacrifices some cause/effect complexity in favor of poetic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and thematically resonant, with tactile details (salt walls, fungal light) and spatial logic creating vivid immersion; sensory coherence only occasionally falters during abstract thematic summaries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Profound metaphorical layering (birds/communal harmony) elevates the narrative impact; the closing symbol of the spare key as renewal device is emotionally resonant. Some emotional beats rely too heavily on adjectival tells rather than earned subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the subterranean ecosystem concept, but occasionally sabotaged by rhythmic repetition of descriptive structures ("curved, salt-crusted walls"; "crushing odds") and overapplication of ornate phrasing that veers toward mannerism without adding semantic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere through thematic scaffolding rather than organic integration; the brief length serves poetic compression but limits psychological and contextual specificity. Lingering impact stems from symbolic resonance rather than narrative revelation.</comment>
