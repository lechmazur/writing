<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong conceptual motivation and thematic consistency undercut by underdeveloped emotional stakes; actions align with traits but lack visceral human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Extremely tight narrative arc within constraints; momentum driven by precise, resonant actions without superfluous digression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion; stylistic ambition occasionally overshadows emotional authenticity but overall achieves impactful thematic synthesis.</comment>
