<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's cold nature and rebellion are consistent, but emotional transformation feels abrupt; mitten as catalyst lacks layered development of internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels compressed; pacing falters in middle sections, slight disjoint between mitten's discovery and later resistance acts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative atmospheric details (frost, silence) excel; underdevelopment of Citadel's worldbuilding slightly weakens setting integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in altars and mitten; the theme of cultural preservation through small acts is clear but lacks nuanced emotional resonance in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subverts rebellion tropes with incomplete altars; occasionally lapses into ornate description ("forbidden warmth") and slightly mechanical phrasing ("architecture of resistance").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sufficient cohesion but uneven balanceâ€”some elements (Citadel, altars) feel underutilized; emotional impact lingers but lacks transformative depth.</comment>
