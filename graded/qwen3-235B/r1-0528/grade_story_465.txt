<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyra's traits are clear but inconsistently integrated; her motivation drives the plot but isn't deeply interrogated, and the ruler's symbolic resonance feels underdeveloped despite its pivotal role</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structure is clear but relies on abrupt transitions (phantom overload to humming resolution); the 400-word constraint creates compression, but the resolution feels rushed and under-explored</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and twilight atmosphere are lush and integral, creating mood through specific sensory details, though the airship's mechanics remain vaguely defined despite centrality</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance from Lyra's mirrored wonder, effective symbolism, and layered conflict; lacks subtextual complexity and the ending's thematic payoff feels slightly predictable</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into lyrical ornamentation ("phantom overload"); character psychology and the airship's logic feel partially human-adjacent but retain subtle artificial cadences</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Cohesive execution but strained edges; some elements (ruler, airship) serve narrative needs effectively, while others (learned patience) feel conceptually imposed rather than organically explored</comment>
