<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Character's fact-based nature and transformation through empathy are compellingly intertwined; the desperation and internal conflict are conveyed through precise actions, though the emotional depth could be more subtly layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot driven by the compass’s malfunction and the protagonist’s reaction to it; pacing is taut, though the shift from logic to empathy could be more seamlessly foreshadowed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere with sensory details (bread, static, warmth) and a haunting tone that deepens thematic resonance; the unstable dimension remains slightly underexplored but evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Potent emotional impact via juxtaposition of factual detachment and raw grief; literary devices (metaphors like "humming static") and layered themes of memory and empathy elevate the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize to support character growth and theme; the self-contained arc and resonant ending suggest intentional brevity, though some transitions could be smoother.</comment>
