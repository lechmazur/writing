<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct, but motivation rooted in generalized prejudice feels underexplored compared to specific personal trauma. Actions align with defiance but lack intimate emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Taut internal arc in confronting prejudice through symbolic confrontation, but plot momentum is impeded by abstract cosmic elements that dilute narrative urgency within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eerie sensory cohesion with glass crunch, spectral chill, and warped reflections creates immersive atmosphere, though cosmic echoes disrupt the haunting's grounded emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (fractured reflections, burning defiance) and tactile symbolism elevate the theme, but explicit declarations of "fear binding" lack subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery undercut by over-reliance on "echoes" and "whispers" as clich√©d metaphysical manifestations. Emotional depth often told rather than shown through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting and theme integration is ambitious and thematically resonant, but cosmic abstractions and underdeveloped character context prevent full realization of its conceptual potential.</comment>
