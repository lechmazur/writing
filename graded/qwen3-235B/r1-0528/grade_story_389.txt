<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is archetype-driven, lacks internal conflict or growth; motivations are surface-level and trope-dependent, with actions merely illustrating established traits instead of revealing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is linear and predictable, but the confined word count creates tension through temporal urgency; resolution feels abrupt, undercutting narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (grime, cold, crumbling) and eerie sensory contrasts, though the setting’s symbolic resonance with the character’s ambition remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong visceral impact from imagery ("storm-green light," "forgotten ink") and thematic nods to hubris, but lacks layered emotional or philosophical subtext; ending leans on familiar "forbidden knowledge" tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occasional evocative phrasing is undercut by overreliance on gothic tropes (whispering spines, madness-inducing knowledge) and overly ornate adjectives that dilute urgency.</comment>
