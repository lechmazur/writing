<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Poorly defined psychology beneath poetic abstractions; motivation is logically consistent but lacks human texture or internal conflict beyond archetypal "quest" narrative</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression feels intellectually inevitable rather than dramatically earned; structural cohesion is strong but lacks the visceral punch of lived experience within tight constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere transcends typical genre bleakness through sensory specificity and conceptual paradox (glowing decay), though some setting details operate at a conceptual rather than visceral level</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates masterful control of symbolic resonance and thematic layering, with imagery that lingers beyond the page while maintaining narrative momentum</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic horror and archival obsession avoids familiar tropes, but occasional conceptual abstraction weakens emotional immediacy; some rhythmic cadences risk veering into ornamental self-parody</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Technical execution is exceptional, but thematic ambition outpaces psychological and experiential richness required to fully elevate it to "transcendent" literary status</comment>
