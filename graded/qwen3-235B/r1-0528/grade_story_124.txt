<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's skittishness is consistently shown through physicality and setting interactions, but their past as a ballet dancer requires more explicit connection to present motivations and actions. The use of the assigned object and subconscious motivation feels partially superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from tension to quiet resolution, but the loom-repair method of self-discovery lacks narrative urgency. While coherent, the story would benefit from stronger cause-effect between the character's past (ballet) and present actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Moon dust, reinforced plexi, and humming machinery create an immersive lunar atmosphere. The contrast between sterile colony functionality and rustically refined barber adds texture, though the annex's loom feels less organically integrated into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (loom as fragmented psyche, shoes as preserved discipline) are conceptually strong. The quiet ending delivers emotional resonance through restraint rather than overstatement. Some surface-level exposition about the subconscious weakens the "show, don't tell" quality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While evocative phrases like "moondust thick as hush" demonstrate originality, metaphors like "trapped moths" lean toward clich√©. The core conflict resolves too neatly, suggesting a formulaic arc rather than organic character transformation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere in concept more than execution. The ballet shoes and loom create symbolic potential that's only partially fulfilled. The story hints at deeper philosophical inquiry but ultimately delivers simplicity over provocation.</comment>
