<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and emotionally resonant, particularly through physical details like trembling hands and the symbolic destruction of the amber. However, secondary characters (e.g., the artist) remain underdeveloped, with dialogue lacking distinctiveness or subtext.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot's progression feels inevitable and thematically coherent, with the amber's destruction functioning as a structurally satisfying climax. The condensed form works effectively, though some narrative beats (e.g., the mercenary's precise history of betrayal) feel slightly undercontextualized within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional, with sensory details (spray-painted angel, water drips, settling dust, twilight) creating a visceral, haunting setting that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The cathedral's transformation into an artistic ruin directly enhances both mood and thematic resonance about impermanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical layers (amber=entrapment, spider=petrified guilt) and taut, poetic prose elevate the work. The ending's emotional payoff is strong, though the reliance on overt thematic parallels occasionally verges on heavy-handedness rather than subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the amber's symbolic use and atmospheric elements. Some phrasing ("carefully reckless," "improbable longing") risks feeling contrived, but the narrative voice maintains consistent tone. The artist's sudden appearance strains plausibility minimally but serves thematic needs sufficiently.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>Elements are mostly integrated thematically rather than feeling forced. The compact form feels purposeful, ending on a resonant emotional truth. While lacking revolutionary innovation, it operates at a high literary standard with lingering emotional weight.</grade>
