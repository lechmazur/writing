<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strongly defined traits shape Eamonn's quest, but his internal complexity remains underexplored despite vivid motivations. The "frazzled" nervous energy drives actions but isn't fully differentiated in voice or psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed, with cause-effect chains between clues (glitch, bard) and resolution leaning on contrived convenience. Thematic closure achieved at expense of narrative specificity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting achieves striking synthesis of myth and tech through dense, purposeful sensory details (e.g., weeping willow with bioluminescent moss), though some elements (holographic stones) feel superficially appended rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (strands of courage, "strongly weak") resonate thematically but rely on abstract concepts over fully embodied experience. Ending offers intellectual satisfaction more than visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrases like "jubilant despair" and "living record" strain toward profundity but risk pretension. Sensory details occasionally become ornate catalogues rather than organic mood-building. Subtext remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coherence exists at thematic level (liminality, balance) but execution feels overwrought. Assigned elements serve plot mechanics more than narrative depth, though fusion of myth and digital decay offers memorable speculative resonance.</comment>
