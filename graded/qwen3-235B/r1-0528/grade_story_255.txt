<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Seer's motivation is conceptually tied to their pursuit but lacks concrete personal stakes, with inner conflict only broadly implied through juxtaposed traits. Voice remains ambiguously detached despite philosophical musings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Decryption-through-scent lacks internal logic consistency, feeling more symbolic than narratively functional. Plot momentum stumbles between atmospheric pauses and abrupt revelations. The cryptic clues/payoff structure remains underdeveloped in limited space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decaying industrial landscape rendered viscerally through olfactory and tactile details. The juxtaposition of birthday debris against desolation creates haunting dissonance. Synthetic cake vs. petrichor effectively parallels artificial celebration against nature's catharsis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (scent-as-algorithm, "innocent cynicism") elevate craft, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized. Thematic throughlines about temporal accountability surface too late for full dramatic impact. The final walk toward the hangar offers symbolic closure but shallow narrative completion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but occasionally leans on aestheticized decay tropes. Sensory details are specific yet risk ornamental overload. The scent-decryption conceit feels inventive rather than derivative, though its mechanics remain hand-wavy. Emotional subtext remains understated but not flatly stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Every assigned element appears, but cohesion relies on thematic abstraction rather than organic integration. The "score with time" framing gives artificial cohesion. Lingering questions about temporal mechanics suggest shallower subtext than intended. Premise-to-conclusion trajectory feels purposeful but compressed.</comment>
