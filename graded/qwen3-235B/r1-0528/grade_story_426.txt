<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's secretive, passionate nature is well-integrated with her teapot and playlist method. Motivations are clear but could better show emotional depth rather than telling. Hug scene effectively humanizes her complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying cause-effect (playlists awakening spirits) and tight arc within word count. Pacing occasionally stumbles between atmospheric description and action, particularly during Hemlock's introduction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunted park atmosphere is visceral through sensory details (static charge, ghost train sounds), but some descriptions verge on excessive without deeper symbolic purpose. Teapot's fractures as trail maps enhances cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evokes poignant tension between preservation and oblivion through strong metaphor (teapot fragments, corrupted music). Ending resonates thematically, though emotional subtext occasionally leans on descriptors like "angrily peaceful" rather than demonstrated nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mostly avoids clich√©s (playlist encoding of knowledge is inventive) but occasionally overwrites (phrases like "spectral chill washed over her"). Subtext about cultural/psychic preservation is meaningful, but some passages lapse into formal abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements harmonize surprisingly well despite density. The story transcends "assembled parts" through atmospheric cohesion. Brief length strengthens urgency but sacrifices deeper exploration of Hemlock's role.</comment>
