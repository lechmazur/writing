<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait "impatiently patient" inconsistently manifested; motivation to protect languages feels somewhat abstract rather than emotionally grounded, though rivalry dares effectively reveal formative influences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rapid progression from alarm to orchid blooming maintains tension, but compressed structure leaves payoffs feeling rushed. Assigned action/method (divert via dares) cleanly integrates but lacks gradual escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Biodome setting richly evoked through sensory details (humidity, flickering light), with atmospheric tension between artificial ecosystems and fugitive existence. Slightly undermined by occasional over-explanation of tech.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor of forced bloom parallels ethical compromises in linguistic preservation. "Ghostly resolve" motif and layered tension between creation/destruction create lingering resonance. Occasionally strained poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original framing of survival linguistics in a biodome avoids genre clichés; avoids generic cyberpunk tropes. Some purple prose ("tendons protesting like rusted hinges") and overly precise descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually—the tight focus on a single desperate gambit mirrors the constrained timeframe—but thematic weight occasionally overwhelms narrative economy. Biodome setting integrates all components organically.</comment>
