<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is distinct and disturbingly complex, with clear, consistent motivations tied to his zealotry, but his internal contradictions occasionally lack depth in explanation beyond metaphorical treatment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a clear arc from brooding introspection to violent action, though the abrupt shift to darkness feels rushed and the compact structure sacrifices clarity in moment-to-moment progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and atmospheric contrasts between decaying Victorian opulence and encroaching jungle create visceral immersion and thematic resonance; the setting is more evocative than functional but enhances mood/character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful use of symbolism (roots, bottle cap, uprooting) and poetic but precise imagery elevate the narrative, though the ending's abruptness risks undermining emotional payoff despite effective thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through unusual juxtapositions and psychological complexity, but certain phrases ("fractured mind," cosmic significance) veer toward literary self-indulgence, and pacing irregularities suggest minor structural formulaicness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Purposeful brevity works thematically but occasionally sacrifices narrative clarity; elements feel intentionally chosen rather than imposed, leaving lingering existential questions but uneven tonal integration.</comment>
