<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elmswood's 14th-century atmosphere is tactile but time-travel elements (capsule hotel) undermine cohesion; the "crisp pre-dawn air" and "humming pod" clash tonally without deeper integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements synergize thematically (memory/corruption) more than operationally; compression sacrifices some worldbuilding coherence but maintains emotional resonance through precise symbolic choices.</comment>
