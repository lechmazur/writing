<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character consistency in tying knots as metaphorical inquiry exists, but lacks psychological depth; motivation (understanding patterns) is abstract rather than grounded in human experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is circular with purposeful progression (riddle to resolution), but feels condensed to near-abstraction; cause-effect logic (riddle → answer → tying) works, yet lacks narrative weight within limitations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting evokes tangible atmosphere through sensory details (salt, wind, worn stones), though timeframe "between seasons" remains conceptually vague rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (knots as questions, yarn as fate) elevate craft; ending resonates thematically. Subtext of cyclical inquiry vs. elusive truth emerges powerfully through poetic restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in conceptual fusion of market logic, maritime mysticism, and generational craft. Some phrases ("strings of fate") verge on cliché; tone occasionally over-embellished but not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into haunting whole despite compact scope; the yarn-as-thread-of-connection motif binds disparate aspects elegantly, though market wisdom remains under-exploited thematic substrate.</comment>
