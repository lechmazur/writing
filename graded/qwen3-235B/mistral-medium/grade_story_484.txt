<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's generic nature paradoxically undermines his distinctiveness despite establishing clear values. Motivation is stated but lacks nuanced psychological grounding. Brewer profession only loosely informs symbolic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc exists but resolution feels rushed. Assigned action (initiate) drives plot effectively. Method (staircase discoloration) feels arbitrarily connected to overall momentum. Cause-effect logic present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective sensory details create mood (crinkling leaves, stained-glass light), but protest/mansion connection remains underexplored. Atmosphere supports surface narrative but lacks deeper contextual integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emerging theme of values vs. void shows promise through symbolic mirror motif. Emotional impact comes more from poetic language than character depth. Ending feels conceptually satisfying but emotionally thin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Several phrases and metaphors feel conventionally AI-generated ("encroaching darkness," "warping shadows into something less monstrous"). Tends toward purple prose with excessive adjectives. Lacks consistent stylistically distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Elements are present and functional but not deeply interwoven. Story feels somewhat structured around checklist of requirements rather than organic development. Brief length highlights rather than enhances thematic density.</comment>
