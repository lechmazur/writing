<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The paladin's melancholy and duty are consistent, but lack psychological depth; motivations are clear but trope-laden, with minimal development beyond initial traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beginnings and conclusions align thematically, but pacing drags during exposition; the needle's activation feels abrupt, with underdeveloped stakes despite structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details, but the "last star" timeframe remains conceptually vague; observatory setting enhances decay/restoration themes effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like the needle and humming systems offer thematic resonance, but emotional beats are often told, not shown; ending lingers but lacks gut-punch impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in setting/objects but leans on paladin tropes; language occasionally veers into ornamental abstraction ("stars breathe"), weakening visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but unremarkably; length exposes underdeveloped threads; poetic flourishes suggest authorial voice but lack transcendent originality.</comment>
