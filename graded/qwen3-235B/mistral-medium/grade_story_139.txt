<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Monk’s motivation and traits (stubbornness, religious devotion) shape his methodical pursuit, but his internal struggle lacks nuanced psychological depth despite symbolic resonance of his “dark reflection”</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot’s cause-effect logic (tooth marks → dental record → betrayal) works, but pacing feels truncated; abrupt shifts (flute dropping, label tearing) compromise emotional weight</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid mountain/gondola imagery creates mystical, introspective atmosphere; sensory details (cable hum, flickering reflection) and symbolic terrain enhance themes of confronting the past</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., “harvesting the past”) and resonant symbols (flute’s fall, torn label) elevate the narrative; ending’s thematic closure is emotionally satisfying but could deepen subtext</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise and restrained lyrical prose avoid clichés; fresh approach to retribution (analysis over violence) and integration of surreal/psychological elements (dreams, reflections) feel purposeful</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements interwoven into cohesive thematic exploration; concise structure serves narrative intent rather than limitation; lingering resonance in its meditation on letting go</comment>
