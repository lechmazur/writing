<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks depth in motivations beyond surface-level "philosopher" clichés; Elias' transformation feels underdeveloped despite symbolic actions with the cup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single existential crisis, creating a coherent arc but with uneven pacing; the voice interrupting the story feels underjustified.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sewer/orchard contrast is vivid but underexplored; sensory details like leaking water are effective but sporadic in building sustained atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through paradoxical tone ("candid deceit") but stumbles with purple prose ("threadbare quilt") and overly schematic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually tight but emotionally distant; uses assigned elements inventively yet lacks the raw, unforgettable emotional punch of classic literary works.</comment>
