<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits inconsistently portrayed; "free-spirited" conflicts with neurotic tendencies, but artistic motivation and connection to coral/sewing kit are effectively developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but lacks tension; resolution feels somewhat abrupt, though the circular framing device with stones/coral provides modest narrative completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere lushly detailed with sensory immersion (salt air, coral), but the coral restoration station's mechanical humming undercuts its ethereal quality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant metaphors (doubt as shadow, mending as art) and poignant closing image elevate the story, though some abstract emotional states are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of organic (coral) and tactile (sewing) metaphors transcends clich√©s; occasional overwrought phrases ("whispered to her") balanced by unique thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Engaging stylistic flourishes but lacks conceptual boldness; elements are cohesive yet never fully transcend their literal roles to create narrative magic.</comment>
