<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character traits like "elegantly clumsy" and ghost-seeing are superficially applied without integrating into Liam’s profession or decisions; the core motivation to "let go" lacks visceral, nuanced emotional grounding despite the ghost climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters due to redundant elements (ghost tours, elevator repair background) and abrupt pacing; resolution hinges on underdeveloped cause-effect, though the lab-to-liberation arc is minimally functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sterile, sand-filled lab juxtaposed with spectral whispers creates a vivid, tactile atmosphere; sensory details (crumbling petals, adhesive spills) deeply enhance the theme of fragile impermanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (glue, sand castles) and the lyrical, fragmentary prose amplify emotional resonance; the ending’s thematic synthesis of loss and acceptance is poignant, though the climax feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases (e.g., "symphony of acceptance") risk overwrought abstraction, and the elevator repair absentia invites cliché; however, the ghost’s crumbled flower ritual avoids predictability with quiet, specific sorrow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by unfulfilled elements (elevator repair, ghost tours) but salvaged by the lab’s symbolic resonance; the compact form serves the theme of transience, leaving a lingering contemplative mood.</comment>
