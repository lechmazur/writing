<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation; while sarcasm and panic manifest through dialogue/actions, character lacks nuanced inner conflict beyond surface-level defiance. Voice remains distinct but shallow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive arc with the box’s unlocking driving the plot, but pacing feels slightly rushed in tying environmental stakes to the resolution; cause/effect connections are logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with neon decay and desert symbolism; sensory details (scents of rain, creaking billboards) elevate tone, but setting occasionally outweighs character depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (box as environmental choice, water rings as time’s language); ending resonates thematically but relies on abstract closure over concrete emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with the puzzle-box mechanic, but sarcasm and "dying desert" imagery border on familiar; poetic phrasing occasionally veers toward ornate but rarely distracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively into compact allegory; premise is inventive, though the brevity softens thematic weight. Lingering questions about impact linger, suggesting depth.</comment>
