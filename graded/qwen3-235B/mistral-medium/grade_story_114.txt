<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's apathy and transformation through river's influence are clear, but initial motivation lacks depth; his shift from indifference to hope feels abrupt despite the framing device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc with clear cause-effect (frames → reefs → reflection), but pacing strains in establishing emotional weight of transformation within word limits; coherence maintained through recurring motifs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting leans on surreal, atmospheric details (dying god's breath, empty frames) effectively, but dream studio's role feels underexplored; sensory immersion succeeds in oceanic scenes more than in studio's abstract visuals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection through metaphorical coral rebirth and self-referential ending. Symbolism (coffee grinder, frames) and subtext (rebuilding as mutual healing) elevate impact, though emotional nuance occasionally borders on poetic vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés (e.g., non-melodramatic character growth), but some phrases (e.g., "last breath of a dying god") verge on familiar. Description leans into rich lyricism without descending into purple prose, though a few metaphors feel stretched.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Leverages constraints purposefully—aesthetic choices (e.g., brevity of character insight) feel intentional. Elements like coffee and frames cohere thematically, though studio and dying god’s relevance remain marginally underserved.</comment>
