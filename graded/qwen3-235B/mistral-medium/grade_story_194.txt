<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking healing, decoding war's truth) aligns with actions, but psychological depth remains underdeveloped due to brevity; "gracefully awkward" manifests visually but lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure attempts full arc (doubt → quest → revelation → transformation) but feels compressed; key events (healing, code-breaking) lack necessary causal buildup within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create immersive, unsettling atmosphere (bone dust/wine aroma, obsidian eyes); setting transitions (ossuary → forests → healer's haven) maintain cohesive mood despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("bones singing hymns of harsh tenderness") elevate impact; ending achieves thematic closure but relies partly on stated epiphany rather than fully dramatized emotional evolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise (ossuary-restaurant, time-warped letter) subverts expectations; some phrasing ("whispers of secrets," "weight lifted") veers toward cliché while more specific details (marrow dish as memory conduit) shine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Successfully integrates elements into unified whole with lyrical precision; thematic exploration of memory/healing resonates, though character and plot could benefit from deeper excavation within longer format.</comment>
