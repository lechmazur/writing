<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped; Kael's "selflessness" remains abstract rather than demonstrated through action or conflict, with his musical talent serving more as metaphor than narrative function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than logical cause-effect; attempts to convey epic scale within constraints create a sense of rushed conclusion; time jumps and cosmic transitions lack narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create strong atmospheric cohesion; spaceship decay and cosmic phenomena are vividly rendered, but temporal aspects remain conceptually vague rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors and symbolic resonance elevate the narrative; the final chord as thematic culmination works effectively, though occasional overreliance on poetic abstraction weakens emotional impact at key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept handling avoids genre clich√©s, but some phrases ("savage grace") verge on forced poeticism; emotional beats sometimes "tell" rather than "show," betraying slight authorial voice inconsistencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story maintains thematic coherence despite element density, though pacing sacrifices narrative depth; brief length works for poetic tone but undermines character and temporal development.</comment>
