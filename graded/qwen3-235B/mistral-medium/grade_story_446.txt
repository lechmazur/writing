<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but underexplored; the duality of "peaceful anger" and gambler's risk-taking are conceptually compelling but lack human complexity in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but relies on cryptic ledger mechanics without emotional grounding; the ending arc feels conceptually satisfying yet narratively fleeting within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Firefly breeding grounds create vivid atmosphere but lack functional integration beyond aesthetic symbolism; tone and setting never fully coalesce into a lived-world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (hydrolysis as dissolution/rebirth) and cyclical imagery create intellectual resonance; conclusion achieves haunting brevity despite minimalist structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in literalizing "hydrolyze" as magical act; some phrases border on ornate abstraction, but the ledger's dissolution ritual avoids cliché with chemical-mystic fusion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven—ledger and unbecoming are vital, but charity drives and fireflies feel secondary; poetic tone elevates cohesion but risks obfuscation.</comment>
