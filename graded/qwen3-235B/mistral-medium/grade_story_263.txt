<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (reinterpreting the Fallen Prince) is clear but surface-level. The "calculatedly playful" trait manifests through dialogue but lacks deeper behavioral consistency. The plush serves as a shallow symbol of his past rather than a fully integrated emotional anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant three-act compression within word limits: introduction of mission (tide pool scene), inciting incident (girl's question), and resolution (statue transformation). Pacing is brisk but cohesive, though the Prince's final speech connection feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent coral metaphors create immersive, thematically resonant imagery. Sensory details (distorted reflections, glowing coral fragments) beautifully mirror moral ambiguity. Atmospheric cohesion between setting and philosophical themes is exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with layered symbolism (plush sinking as abandoned convictions, coral growth as narrative rebirth). Ending achieves thematic closure through cyclical imagery. Subtext about historical revisionism is intelligently woven but occasionally over-explains.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains faintly synthetic phrasing ("laughter echoed through the reef"). Emotional nuance in Vex's interaction with the girl feels humanized, though some metaphors verge on preciousness. The "ink in water" spread metaphor is particularly fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Anchored by original thesis about historiography as carnival performance. Elements feel purposefully interlinked (plush connects personal past to societal memory). Creates lingering questions about collective narrative ownership without didacticism.</comment>
