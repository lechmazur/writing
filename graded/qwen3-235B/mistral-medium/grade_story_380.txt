<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is evocative but motivation lacks psychological depth; the inability to count informs his tactile relationship with fragments but isn't woven into core identity. Emotional reactions feel occasionally abstract despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Circular structure with the jump/hope motif works within constraints but the resolution feels slightly abrupt; cause-effect chain from photo destruction to "swished" ending is emotionally resonant but structurally compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through specific details (rusted hoop, smell of old glue) that evoke cosmic loneliness; the silent sky-as-tomb metaphor pervasively enhances both setting and existential tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery (shattered dreams as paper/scars) and recursive metaphors (plunging as both action and mental unraveling) deepen themes; ending resonates but could push subtext about theft's cyclical nature further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but dances near "mad genius artist" tropes; the woman's disappearance feels under-earned. Language balances precision and poetry without devolving into ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around identity fragmentation, but the math attribute serves mainly as flavor. The brevity enhances tension through suggestive gaps rather than feeling restrictive; the final "swished" memory invites contemplation.</comment>
