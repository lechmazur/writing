<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's agoraphobia shapes their isolation well, but motivations lack nuanced psychological depth. The snuffbox's symbolic connection to inherited burdens is clear, but internal conflict remains abstract rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but progression feels compressed. The inciting incident (snuffbox cracking) lacks narrative weight, and resolution is emotionally underdeveloped despite strong thematic setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere with sensory details (wet sand, snuffbox mechanics) effectively supports tone. Dunes and snuffbox imagery create cohesive moodscape, though geographic/spatial logic remains undefined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (snuffbox as heart, dunes as fate) but emotional impact is diffuse. Ending's thematic statement feels slightly overdetermined rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through inventive combinations (mechanical snuffbox with symbolic weight). Some abstract descriptions risk poetic vagueness, but maintains stylistic consistency without devolving into artificiality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements present but not fully integrated. The snuffbox cracks with satisfying inevitability, while the timeframe/gramophone connection feels underutilized. Conceptual ambition exceeds narrative execution.</comment>
