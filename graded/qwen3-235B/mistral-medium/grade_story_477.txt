<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but thinly developed; 'graceful swordsman' doesn't strongly influence actions beyond symbolic defiance, and the 'mindfully scattered' trait lacks integration into decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arc is complete but pacing feels compressed; the scavenging method drives the plot but cause/effect between cosmic signals and escape remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Underwater garden is vivid but inconsistently grounded (e.g., avian presence); sensory details enhance atmosphere but occasionally overshadow logical coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through metaphor and subtext, though some lyrical prose veers into stylized abstraction; ending balances resolution with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by generic descriptors and clich√©d contrasts (e.g., 'chaos vs. order'); metaphors are often striking but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally prioritized over character depth; poetic style elevates the narrative but risks diluting emotional authenticity.</comment>
