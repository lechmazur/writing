<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Superficial character traits; necromancy and nostalgia lack meaningful narrative integration. Motivations feel abstract rather than visceral. Dialogue doesn't unveil psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle but rushed conclusion. Cause-effect from tremor to climax lacks development. Pacing inconsistent; "dominate" goal mentioned but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Strong initial atmospheric imagery undermined by tonal clashes (necromancy vs. sci-fi). Sensory details overly reliant on visual spectacle; inconsistent logic between elements (whispering crystals, glowing necromancy).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors ("whispers from stone") undermined by clich√©d phrases. Central conflict remains vague. Dialogue feels tacked on; ending lacks thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Derivative setup (explorers racing rivals) with minimal subversion. Overuse of "pulsing," "fractured," and "glow." Character interactions feel contrived. Metaphors generic ("sound of resolve").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Numerous elements present but unevenly synthesized. Tension between conceptual poles (sci-fi/necromancy, nostalgia/futurism) remains unexplored. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution.</comment>
