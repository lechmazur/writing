<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character embodies paradoxical 'repulsively attractive' form well, but lacks internal conflict/evolution beyond static devotion to gathering fragments. Motivation clear yet underexplored through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as a lyrical tableau rather than progression-driven narrative. Structure coherent but resists traditional arcs; pacing meditative to the point of stasis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly tactile setting blends mechanical and celestial seamlessly - the dissonant beauty of rusted grace in an orchard fed by stardlight creates potent atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (fragments as unsaid confessions), but emotional weight relies heavily on lyrical descriptions rather than earned through character embodiment. Ending thematically resonant yet narratively static.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through unique synthesis of automotive and cosmic elements, but some phrases ("aching to gather them") verge on poetic formulaism. Subtextual depth occasionally undercut by explicit emotional statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into haunting whole through consistent tone and imagery, though narrative tension remains minimal. Short form enhances thematic focus on eternal rituals rather than constraining.</comment>
