<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but underdeveloped; immortality and rigidity lack tangible influence beyond poetic descriptions. Emotional motivation feels abstract rather than viscerally human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive structure creates cyclical tension but undermines narrative progression. Pacing maintains momentum despite tight constraints, with clear thematic bookends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere through precise, contrasting details (machines vs. organic decay, particle motion vs. stillness). Sensory language creates haunting, layered worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink patterns, "launch" as ritual) carry significant thematic weight. Emotional impact emerges through accumulation of fragments rather than overt demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of ecological elegy and speculative elements avoids genre tropes. Avoids purple prose through purposeful imagery; emotional subtext emerges through environmental resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive thematic lattice under scrutiny, though some (rigidly flexible) remain loosely integrated. Story feels conceptually complete despite brevity.</comment>
