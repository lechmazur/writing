<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character exists as poetic abstraction rather than psychologically complex entity; traits feel conceptually consistent yet emotionally distant, with motivation presented more as cosmic inevitability than human-scale struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but cosmic stakes feel underdramatized; action sequences lack visceral specificity to ground metaphysical concepts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (machinery hum, moon dust) establish setting, but lunar colony remains visually sparse backdrop rather than thematically integrated force shaping protagonist's consciousness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (marble fractures mapping cosmic design) and lyrical prose elevate narrative; conclusion resonates as mythic gesture rather than fully earned emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hybrid mysticism-sci-fi framework shows conceptual ambition but suffers from inconsistent tonal execution; some phrasings ("cosmic scoreboard") veer toward speculative clich√© rather than transcendent originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative coherence maintained but feels shaped more by symbolic imperative than organic storytelling; elements function as poetic devices rather than narrative necessities.</comment>
