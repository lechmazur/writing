<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character transformation feels abrupt despite some emotional resonance; personal demons are hinted at but underexplored, motivations lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure cohesive with clear arc, but pivotal moments (arrival at carnival, improv prompt) lean too heavily on conveniences rather than organic progression within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eerie, tactile atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details (groaning gears, smudged tickets), but some metaphors (e.g., dying stars) feel overfamiliar rather than freshly observed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic layering of belonging through labyrinths/bridges symbolism; ending resonant but emotional payoff slightly undercut by insufficiently earned character catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through metaphorical ingenuity (improv as redemption), but certain phrases ("laughter echoing from a time long past") flirt with AI-generated poeticism rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story coheses through precise lyrical control and thematic unity, though some structural choices feel dictated by assigned elements rather than creative necessity.</comment>
