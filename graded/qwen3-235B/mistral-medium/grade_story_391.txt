<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits (rogue minstrel, spontaneous caution) are atmospheric but underexplored; motivation lacks personal stakes, reducing emotional resonance despite poetic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots on vague cause-effect (singing activates the reef); pacing is uneven, leaning on lyrical abstraction rather than structurally sound progression within word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oceanscape and piano-dust timeframe create immersive, layered atmosphere; sensory details (humming coral, galvanized truth) evoke mood but occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion (quiet revolution as cultural reawakening) and visceral imagery (driftwood as fragmented consciousness); emotional impact diluted by passive character engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but flirts with pretension (e.g., "fingers stained with salt and time"); metaphors are inventive but occasionally overwrought, risking emotional detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements like apron/carvings do heavy symbolic work but unevenly; brevity feels limiting rather than elegant, lacking narrative urgency beneath lyrical surface.</comment>
