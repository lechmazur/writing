<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but lacks depth; motivations are implied rather than explored, leaving him as a poetic vessel rather than a fully realized human being.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is inventive, using the coaster’s loops as a metaphor for cyclical legacy. The 500-word arc feels cohesive despite ambitious scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory alchemy—decaying sweetness, metallic twilight—creates a hauntingly tangible world where legacy lives in dust and rust.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Emotional impact is undercut by overly familiar "burden-to-redemption" arcs; symbolism is potent but occasionally heavy-handed, lacking subversive edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the perfume/memory fusion but falters into gothic clichés (ghosts, crumbling estates); prose oscillates between lyrical and excessively ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but unevenly; some (illustration/coaster) feel organically fused while others (parallel paths) remain underexplored thematic gestures.</comment>
