<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Limited internal exploration of the diplomat’s conflicting motivations; character transformation inferred through symbolic gestures rather than organic emotional shifts. Voice remains introspective but vague, sacrificing specificity for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is conceptually complete but occasionally undercut by elliptical transitions (e.g., abrupt handing of the key to the child). The birds’ role as catalyst lacks narrative grounding, relying on thematic resonance over cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral, immersive atmosphere with crystalline walls, salt-crusted cheeks, and lantern flicker. Sensory details (sounds of bus engine vs. birds’ whispered freedom) deepen the thematic contrast between surface and subterranean worlds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (birds as "counterpoint of hearts," salt as "forgotten patterns") elevate the narrative. Ending’s thematic clarity—tradition as living memory—lands with emotional weight, though some subtext feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes ("joyfully tragic," "liberate hearts") risk cloying abstraction. While the salt mine setting and birds offer originality, the diplomat’s arc follows a familiar "outsider learns from wise community" template without radical subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively weaves assigned elements into its symbolism, but some (e.g., spare key, "boldly timid" tone) feel imposed rather than organic. The brevity works thematically but leaves emotional beats underexplored.</comment>
