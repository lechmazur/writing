<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths in showing Elias’s emotional state through tactile interactions with objects, but motivation to “abduct the truth” lacks gradual build-up; self-deception theme is hinted but inconsistently tied to actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc from flinching to facing the chisel works, but pacing stumbles between symbolic revelations; cause/effect for clockwork animals awakening feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting as decaying/mystical hybrid is vividly rendered through sensory details; clockwork animals’ presence deepens character backstory, but timeframe (sculptor’s chisel moment) isn’t fully woven into momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (e.g., marble mirror as self-realization) and visceral imagery elevate impact; resolution feels abrupt but aligns with theme, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking original imagery balanced with occasional clichéd phrasing (“map of defeats”); tone remains consistent but over-relies on dramatic contrasts (tomb/cradle) without nuanced escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalescence into a thematic whole despite tight constraints; the metaphorical ending lingers, but integration of all prompts occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>
