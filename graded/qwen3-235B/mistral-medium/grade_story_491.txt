<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than visceral; motivation is stated but not fully dramatized through specific actions or internal conflict. Emotional stakes remain diffuse despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong circular structure with thematic resonance, but the tight word limit forces rushed transitions between key moments. Plot logic relies heavily on metaphor rather than organic progression, occasionally sacrificing narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid, haunting sensory details (e.g., "fragrance a grudging admiration"), but the greenhouse and harbor function more as symbolic tableaux than integrated, lived-in worlds that actively shape character decisions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful literary devices (quilt as existential metaphor, wristband as cyclical motif) elevate the narrative beyond prose. The paradoxical ending lingers thematically, though emotional engagement remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures but occasionally lapses into lush abstraction that borders on self-indulgent "concept porn." The central conceit feels human in its philosophical melancholy, though some sentences strain under ornate syntax.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but sometimes feel compartmentalized - the greenhouse, quilt, and harbor occupy distinct narrative compartments rather than intersecting organically. Ambition outpaces execution in the constrained form.</comment>
