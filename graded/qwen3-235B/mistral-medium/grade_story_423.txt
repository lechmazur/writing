<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's earnestness is stated but not deeply demonstrated; motivation to 'spark flames' lacks psychological texture; actions follow plot demands more than personal logic; voice leans poetic but risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves through symbolic gestures rather than tangible stakes; mapping fractures as action lacks mechanical/logical clarity; beginning/middle/end structure implied but underdeveloped; pacing feels condensed without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly tactile (glass, cold, parchment) but overly reliant on adjectives; desert and aqueduct settings evoke decay but don't drive narrative; tone wavers between mythic and sentimental.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery ('language of tears,' 'canvas of life') diluted by over-explanation; ending resolves too cleanly, undercutting thematic ambiguity; layered themes hinted at but not fully excavated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Verdant clich√©s ('howled like a ghost,' 'crisp nostalgia') recur like AI-generated motifs; emotional arcs declared rather than earned; metaphors feel rehearsed; inconsistent attention to concrete detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially woven rather than organically fused; writing elevates style over narrative momentum; ambition evident but execution feels contrived, not urgent.</comment>
