<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (decoding symbols to reclaim identity) is consistent and drives plot, but lacks emotional depth beyond symbolic function. Arc from scapegoat to self-reclamation is clear but underpinned by abstraction rather than psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight structure with resonant beginning/end linkage (library card cycle), but pacing relies heavily on poetic abstraction, occasionally obscuring narrative causality within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (fog, humming air) but setting remains underexplored; the "cloud city" lacks tangible specificity that might deepen thematic resonance with abandoned identities or symbolic decoding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (washer/mirror) deliver emotional and philosophical weight. Ending is satisfying, but prose sometimes prioritizes lyricism over concrete emotional engagement, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story avoids clich√©s through inventive metaphors (scapegoat profession, washer-guided identity quest). Language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction but maintains a distinctive voice that enhances originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements are cohesive and thematically layered, producing a resonant, self-contained narrative. The brevity feels purposeful but raises minor questions about worldbuilding clarity for readers seeking literal engagement.</comment>
