<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's introspective depth is strong, but motivations (guilt, abandonment) are implied rather than fully earned, with inconsistent emotional stakes between memories and present actions. The "joyless performer" label lacks concrete behavioral evidence beyond limp costumes and vague regret.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves a circular structure (beginning/end at lake), but pacing lags in middle metaphors. The action of burying the knob lacks narrative urgency, creating a static rhythm. Resolution feels underdeveloped despite symbolic intent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prismatic lake and construction site create striking contrasts. Sensory details (fresh paint, sequins) immerse effectively, though the lake's magical glow occasionally risks over-symbolizing at the expense of realism. Timeframe and setting work synergistically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance relies heavily on metaphor density (scaffolding, seesaws). While imagery is potent, thematic clarity wavers between "guilt" and "acceptance." Ending avoids triteness but could deepen the tension between stagnation and progress.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrases ("modestly extravagant burdens") border on self-indulgence. The drawer knob symbol feels organic, but occasional overabstraction ("prismatic dissonance") hinders emotional immediacy. Avoids major tropes but slips toward melancholic clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong in elemental integration but falters in narrative momentum. The brevity works conceptually but sacrifices full emotional catharsis. Lingering questions about the performer's future remain purposeful rather than accidental.</comment>
