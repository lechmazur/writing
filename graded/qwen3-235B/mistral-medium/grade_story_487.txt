<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character shows through actions and environment reactions, but lacks depth beyond assigned traits. Motivation feels abstract, with little explored nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive arc with beginning/end connection, but pacing uneven—some plot elements rushed, others linger. Concept influences plot but feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (man-eating plants, bioluminescent vines) create immersive atmosphere. Drum solos as timeframe and plant reactivity enhance tone, though timeframe integration is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich imagery and subtext (myth-making as rebirth) elevate impact. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional resonance slightly undercut by underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with unique combinations (e.g., greenhouse labyrinth, baton raising dead) but leans on vague descriptors ("docile bruiser") and occasionally abstract phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesively woven into a compact, mythic narrative. Strength lies in symbolic economy, though some forced integrations (treasure map) slightly dampen overall polish.</comment>
