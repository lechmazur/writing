<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Renders motivation clearly but leans on archetypes over psychological depth; actions align with "unplanned encore" drive but character remains stylized abstraction rather than fully embodied individual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between map's tear and fate-twisting lacks mechanical specificity; pacing balances lyrical pauses with decisive action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually sumptuous atmosphere with tactile details like "needles clicking like bones" and shifting cup contents; sensory overload occasionally obscures thematic clarity but effectively immerses reader in uncanny milieu.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink/wine/blood cup, crocheted fate-blanket) resonate thematically; ending's poetic symmetry works conceptually but emotional payoff is diffused; prose style enhances mystical tone while occasionally bordering on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through idiosyncratic imagery (familiars knitting fate) but contains moments of elevated diction that feel performed; character psychology follows conceptual logic over human complexity; mostly avoids purple prose through precise phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate with varying success—map/crocheting metaphors shine while volunteer-method feels extraneous; style elevates premise but abstract resolution leaves thematic potential underharvested; haunting yet slightly ephemeral impact.</comment>
