<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weak interiority; motivations are explicit but underexplored. Actions (planting, card use) lack psychological nuance. "Typically atypical" crops and "jabbering" hint at deeper trauma but aren't fully enacted through behavior or voice. The abrupt shift from cards to seeds feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic arc (cards→plant→leaf) drives plot. Some pacing inconsistencies: accelerated plant growth bypasses dramatic tension. Causal logic missing between reversed Magician card and black seed's arrival. Resolution ties back to opening motifs effectively, but the "quiet rebellion" theme would benefit from more concrete dramatization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visually vivid: dying sun, golden cracks, "veins-like roots" create haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (taste of "bitterness of memory," tactile card descriptions) reinforce tone. Ethereal plains evoke post-apocalyptic desolation while maintaining strange beauty. Some dissonance: "song of boundaries" announced but not sonically integrated into setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Skillful metaphor economy: cards as fragmented illusions, seeds as defiance. The leaf's indecipherable text but intuitive understanding strains believability. The closing image (plains as blank page) is poignant. Some reliance on lyrical abstraction ("raw solace," "shimmering") risks vagueness. Central theme of personal liberation is clear but could deepen emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original concept execution diluted by familiar post-apocalyptic tropes. "Ethereal plains" and "resource war" verge on generic. Unique touches like memory-tasting fruit and black void-seeds show ingenuity. Purple prose avoided, but some overused patterns ("whispering wind," "pulse in veins"). Subtext about rewriting one's narrative is effective though occasionally heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive but unevenly integrated. Cards and seeds form conceptual bridge; "song of boundaries" remains thematic abstraction. Brief length works beautifully for cyclical structure but rushes existential transformation. Lingering question about post-leaf reality lingers effectively. The "quiet war" motif suggests deeper lore left unexplored.</comment>
