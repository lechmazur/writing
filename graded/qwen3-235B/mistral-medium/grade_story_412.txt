<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's bookishness and "geographically challenged" trait remain abstract concepts rather than defining characteristics that shape actions or voice. Motivation for "new order" is stated but lacks grounding in personal stakes or concrete consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague, ritualistic actions (pressing the key cover) without clear cause-effect logic. Internal monologue drives pacing unevenly, creating an abstract buildup without concrete progression or resolution beyond stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setting as frequency monitoring station lacks tactile details beyond humming walls. Sensory elements (flickering monitors, rubber texture) are underdeveloped, failing to create a fully immersive world that justifies the high-concept premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("echoes of erased people") and thematic tension between silence/action resonate, but over-reliance on abstract phrasing ("mournful elation") occasionally undermines emotional authenticity. The ending's symbolic weight is diluted by vague execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but teeters on AI-generated tendencies: repetitive descriptors ("jagged edges of fractured soul"), overly solemn tone, and abstract conflict without tangible stakes. Some phrases feel like stylistic imitation rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in proximity rather than symbiosis – the key cover's significance feels arbitrarily assigned rather than organically earned. The self-serious tone sustains atmosphere but limits narrative momentum, making brevity feel like constraint rather than strength.</comment>
