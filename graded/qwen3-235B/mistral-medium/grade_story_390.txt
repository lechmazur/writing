<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's calmness is consistent but undeveloped; motivation is stated but lacks psychological depth; actions align with traits but remain surface-level archetypal gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has hypnotic rhythm but lacks structural tension; cause-effect between petal and empire's fall remains abstract; circular trajectory (assassin arrives, acts, departs) feels overly stylized rather than dramatically earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually intoxicating blend of opulent decay and natural menace; sensory details like "brass edges cold against his skin" and "stone sighing" create immersive paradox of fragile permanence; cultural specifics remain generic but atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterfly wings, petal's veins) resonate beyond literal mechanics; subtext about power's fragility is poignant; closing image of crumbling stones is emotionally resonant yet feels slightly contrived in its mythic portentousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in concept but occasionally succumbs to ornate abstraction ("whispers curled like smoke"); metaphors are striking yet occasionally overburdened; tone maintains consistency despite genre-blending; human nuances in character psychology remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements merge into cohesive tableau rather than narrative engine; brevity feels intentional for poetic impact; thematic unity about impermanence succeeds despite plot's metaphysical vagueness; lingers uneasily rather than haunts decisively.</comment>
