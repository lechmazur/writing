<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's grief is visceral but "passionately indifferent" motivation lacks depth; actions convey trauma but interactions feel underdeveloped; assigned attribute shapes behavior but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Meandering yet cohesive arc from silence to writing; pacing balanced between meditation and narrative inertia; cause/effect between trauma and actions implied but under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Oppressive atmosphere masterfully built through tactile details (cold bell, candle shadows) and symbolic blueprints; setting acts as physical manifestation of character's psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Profound subtext about grief-as-archival resistance; economical prose carries emotional weight; ending resonates thematically but slightly over-explains with "too precious to ring."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"After-images" concept borders on overused but subverts expectations through nightmare-logic; avoids melodrama but risks obscurity in emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity (silence vs. progress) but some arbitrary connections; style enhances mood without overshadowing substance; lingers emotionally but imperfectly realized.</comment>
