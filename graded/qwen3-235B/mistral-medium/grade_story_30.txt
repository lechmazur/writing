<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Surface-level motivation but shallow integration of "telekinetic" aspect beyond one plot beat; philosophical practicality explained through actions but lacks internal conflict or evolution</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere and central metaphor succeed but narrative contortions to force all elements coexist without true synthesis; promising themes undercut by superficial integration</comment>
