<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character’s eccentricity and burden of leadership are well-embodied through pruning and cryptic maps, but internal motivations occasionally lack emotional grounding. The secret handshake manual adds dimension, while interactions with the protégé reveal growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from isolation to confrontation to acceptance, but pacing unevenly distributes emotional weight. The orchard framing creates cohesion, though the workshop timeframe feels underexplored, diluting narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visual details like solar panels and rustling leaves effectively contrast technology with nature. Atmosphere is rich but occasionally undercut by vague descriptors (e.g., “bittersweet grit” could benefit from concrete sensory ties).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphor of pruning as liberation and the self-guided maps provoke reflection. Dialogue is sparse but resonant. Theme of distributed authority is clearly conveyed, though emotional depth occasionally relies on stated rather than shown nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unique juxtaposition (solar panels/orchard, cartography as rebellion). Some phrasing (“whispering pages,” “leaves rustling like turning pages”) leans poetic but rarely crosses into excess. Character logic feels humanly flawed, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically but some elements (e.g., disclaimers in brochures) feel contrived to fit prompts. The ending lingers but doesn’t fully transcend its structure. Word limit constraints occasionally limit character and conflict depth.</comment>
