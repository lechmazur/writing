<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's skewed vision shapes his perception of the sketches, but inner conflicts remain abstract. Motivation for photographing vanishing trades is clear but lacks psychological depth. The child scene attempts transformation but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure, beginning and ending with the sketches, but the journey feels compressed. Hieroglyphs as a driving action are under-explained. Transitions between scenes lack concrete cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere melds mystical (glowing pottery) and tactile (shadow play, weaving rhythms) details. The "silent revolution" setting works metaphorically but lacks grounded historical texture. Sensory coherence is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery-rich prose evokes reflection through layered metaphors (e.g., roots, threads). The ending subverts preservation-as-archival to preservation-as-legacy. Subtext about continuity is well-woven. "Showing" dominates over "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original in concept (botanical maps, silent revolution), but some phrases verge on poetic abstraction without deeper grounding (e.g., "fractured light"). Avoids clich√©s but risks over-reliance on lyricism over narrative specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements are tightly integrated thematically but occasionally strain under word limit. The brevity feels deliberate, though cohesion relies on the reader connecting sparse dots. Lingering resonance comes from metaphor rather than plot resolution.</comment>
