<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poorly defined duality between "faux" and "real visions"; motivation stated rather than embodied through nuanced decisions; emotional reactions feel abstract rather than grounded in specific moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to revelation but relies on passive progression; cause-and-effect lacks tension due to lack of obstacles; endings feels convenient rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies heavily on familiar "ancient mystery" tropes; sensory details uneven—some striking images (e.g., "bone flute’s song") undercut by generic descriptors ("crumbling bookshop").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like language as "dormant" offer thematic resonance, but emotional beats are told rather than demonstrated; ending lacks subtext beneath its plainly stated "purpose."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blends mystical elements with academic intrigue but never fully subverts expectations; some purple prose ("peaceful anger," "labyrinthine alleys") dilutes authenticity; character psychology feels diagrammatic, not lived-in.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; the bone flute and archive carry conceptual weight, but "planting season" and "regularly seldom" feel arbitrary; theme of preserving history lacks visceral urgency.</comment>
