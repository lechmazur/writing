<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psyche; motivations lack emotional grounding. Inconsistent reaction to objects (dice) and weak voice undermine authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot relies on contrived coincidences; pacing wavers between rushed and stagnant. The "misalignment" concept resolves too neatly, undercutting tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setting emphasizes aesthetic over substance; sensory details (oil, gears) feel generic. Timeframe ("throughout rehearsals") underutilized to build atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of fate vs. free will hinted at but superficially explored. Ending lacks narrative weight; emotional resonance is stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on steampunk/outlaw tropes with minimal subversion. Purple prose in descriptions (e.g., "walls of the coffee shop shifted text like restless spirits"). Predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially bound together; story feels like a mosaic of concepts rather than cohesive narrative. Short length exposes structural fragility, not deliberate brevity.</comment>
