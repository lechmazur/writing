<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (reclaiming identity) is consistent with symbolic actions, but lacks emotional specificity. The "forgotten noble" trait isn't fully integrated into distinct behaviors or decisions. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear transformation arc within constraints, but causal connections (why ticket stubs? why now?) rely on abstraction rather than narrative logic, weakening structural cohesion. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (humming machinery, searing heat) and unstable setting mirror the character's psychological state. Atmosphere is the story's most fully realized element. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic resonance (drone as fractured self, fire as revelation) elevate the narrative, though some poetic imagery risks substituting ambiguity for depth. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally overuses elaborate phrasing ("symphony of danger and discovery") that feels aestheticized rather than purposeful. Emotional arcs remain diffuse. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story feels intentionally distilled rather than limited by its brevity. Conceptual elements enhance thematic unity, though some technical flourishes overshadow organic characterization. </comment>
