<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation for self-acceptance remains abstract; character's actions (abandoning nest, eating fruit) lack visceral emotional grounding despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear arc from wandering to realization, but pacing feels compressed; static-laden phone confession introduces tension abruptly rather than organically escalating plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interstellar orchard ship's bioluminescent fruit and whispering corridors create immersive, otherworldly atmosphere that enriches tone and theme through tactile sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphoric use of falling/flight resonates thematically; dialogue-free story relies heavily on abstract imagery but maintains cohesion through recurring nest/orchard symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elegiac prose occasionally dips into overwrought phrasing ("mocking affection for his own tangled thoughts"); metaphors feel fresh but some descriptions verge on poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but strain narrative logic (cordless phone in space ship); concise format works as metaphorical microcosm rather than arbitrary limitation.</comment>
