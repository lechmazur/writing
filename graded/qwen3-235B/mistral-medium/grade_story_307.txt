<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Guardian's rebelliousness drives plot but lacks emotional nuance; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through layered choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity (resistance seeds rebellion) but lacks rising tension; pacing prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal grit manifested through vivid textures (burnt sugar, flickering neon) and sanctuary-like shop; setting as living extension of character's purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (DVD=city, light=resistance) resonate, but explicit statements like "you are the light" dilute subtlety; ending's rallying cry feels earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging repair/revolution; suffers from occasional purple prose ("mosaic of resistance") and clich√©d rebellion tropes.</comment>
