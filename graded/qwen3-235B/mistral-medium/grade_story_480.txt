<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but superficially rendered; the "social media exorcist" premise lacks concrete connection to actions, and emotional shifts feel underexplored despite attempts at transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear progression, but pacing stumbles in the middle; cause-effect logic holds, though the 500-word constraint creates abrupt transitions between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere created through evocative sensory details (neon lights, tactile receipt), but some descriptors verge on overwrought; setting effectively embodies thematic decay-and-revival duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (receipt as map, fading chords) elevates thematic depth; emotional impact is uneven—potent in vignettes but diffuse in broader arc; ending avoids pat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by clichéd phrases ("raw edge of life") and tonal inconsistencies; metaphors like "quietly loud" are striking but occasionally feel prepackaged rather than organically discovered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; brevity serves mood over plot complexity; ideas linger, but deeper integration of components (e.g., social media angle) remains unrealized.</comment>
