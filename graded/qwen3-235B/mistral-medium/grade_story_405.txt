<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's skepticism drives action but lacks emotional depth; motivation tied to grief feels underexplored despite clear thematic intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot reaches a resolution but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., door opening) and uneven pacing within tight constraints; coherence is strained by abstract cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Immersion sustained by vivid fungal imagery and sensory decay; overused descriptors ("damp earth") and underdeveloped objects (doll) dilute cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (petals as map) and subtext (grief-as-geography) resonate, but themes lack the weight to transcend surrealism; ending feels both resolved and hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Concepts like mushroom-as-heart are inventive but undercut by clichéd tropes (cryptic subway codes, child’s doll as pathos); prose veers between striking and pretentious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in uneasy tension—ambitious symbolism clashes with underdeveloped character psychology; brevity enhances mystery but weakens emotional engagement.</comment>
