<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's stage fright and inheritance conflict are thematically clear but lack nuanced reactions; motivation drives key actions but feels abstractly portrayed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ritual progression provides momentum, but the abrupt demon defeat and time-constrained setup weaken causality; ending resolves plot but muddies thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris as metaphor elevates atmosphere, but sensory immersion is inconsistent; setting-object links (wildflowers, toys) work better than strained "defiant hush" tonal contrasts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√© but occasionally veers into ornate abstractions; character psychology leans on symbolic gestures over human nuance, though orbital-wildflower fusion shows originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poetic whole but occasionally feel checklist-driven; brevity works for mood but limits thematic payoff, leaving ideas underexplored despite evocative synthesis.</comment>
