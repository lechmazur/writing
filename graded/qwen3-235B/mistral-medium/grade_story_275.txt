<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivation is implied through symbolism rather than organic development. Actions are archetypal but disconnected from tangible personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on symbolic cause-effect rather than narrative logic. Pacing feels rushed yet poetic, with some unresolved tensions between abstract imagery and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely rendered with visceral sensory details, though environmental elements sometimes overwhelm human-scale stakes. Atmosphere transcends mere mood to become a narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical resonance and quiet transcendence. The thematic throughline of ecological rebirth as rebellion is compelling, though emotional beats occasionally drift toward overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing. Metaphors feel fresh albeit occasionally overstuffed. Subtextual layering is present but could benefit from sharper narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story achieves remarkable cohesion given the density of assigned elements. Tone remains consistent, though some conceptual integration (e.g., "theoretically rebellious") feels contrived. Leaves lingering symbolic weight.</comment>
