<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (wayward apothecary, unjustly fair hands) are underexplored. Motivation for butterfly tracking is stated but not fully dramatized. The use of Morse code lacks emotional or psychological connection to the character's past as a healer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies heavily on poetic imagery rather than narrative drive. The Morse code method feels arbitrarily chosen rather than organically developed. The submarine's mechanics don't meaningfully influence the plot beyond superficial atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine and broken treaties timeframe create visual intrigue, but sensory details feel generic (prismatic light streaks, hissing pipes). The "battered marvel" tone is inconsistently maintained with overly romantic descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterflies as guides, pen as sacred tool) create emotional resonance. Ending achieves thematic closure through circular structure. The conflict between war and beauty is conveyed through evocative imagery rather than explicit exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Contains both fresh concepts (highlighter pen as sacred tool) and clich√©d elements ("storm clouds" of treaties). Some sensory details feel generic ("battered marvel" repeated as mantra). Writing style oscillates between poetic and affected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but sacrifices depth. Assigned elements sometimes feel like checklist items rather than integrated components. The butterfly symbolism lingers, but emotional impact is diluted by overly ornate prose.</comment>
