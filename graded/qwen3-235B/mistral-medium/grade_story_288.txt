<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is present but underdeveloped; connections between profession, "wildness," and artistic drive remain superficial despite thematic hints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels compressed; ozone station's quarantine and the sculpture's creation lack clear causal linkage within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually vivid atmosphere with ozone station's sterile data and tactile flag details, but surreal blend of environmental monitoring and childhood ritual strains logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors for freedom resonate, but heavy-handed symbolism (flag as scar metaphor repetition) weakens emotional subtlety; theme of art's endurance feels abstract rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unorthodox element combinations (blacksmith/paddleboarding) suggest originality, but inconsistent sensory detail treatment and portentous sentence structures border on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition is evident, but uneven element execution and occasionally artificial thematic stitching prevent cohesion at elite publication standards.</comment>
