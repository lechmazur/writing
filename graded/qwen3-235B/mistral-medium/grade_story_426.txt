<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Underdeveloped reactions; motivation is present but lacks psychological depth despite clear thematic ties.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but some connections (playlist to manuscript) rely on convenience rather than organic plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere overloads on clichéd "haunted park" tropes without grounding details; sensory descriptions feel disconnected from character experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Forced symbolism (cracks = trauma) and stated emotions; ending lacks subtext with excessive "world's amnesia" metaphor literalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Transitions sound algorithmic; repetitive "porcelain remembering hands"; tone abruptly shifts between mystical and clinical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cohesion undermined by conflicting priorities – folk medicine theme competes with sports/playlist elements for narrative dominance.</comment>
