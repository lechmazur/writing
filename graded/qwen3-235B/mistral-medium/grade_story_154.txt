<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (tracking social changes, burden of legacy) remain abstract despite poetic gestures. The "frazzled courier" oscillates between trembling vulnerability and mystical transcendence without psychological continuity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pseudo-epic structure (village → ritual → enlightenment) works within constraints, but the ink-symbology sequence strains coherence. Levitation feels imposed rather than earned through plot logic</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting reduces "Celtic village" to clichéd thatched roofs and stone circles. No authentic cultural specificity - could be any fantasy village with mist photoshopped in</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-density (ink as legacy/storms as change) borders on overload but creates visceral impact. The final image of tracked futures in mist-erased air is hauntingly circular</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Surprisingly avoids most AI traps - paragraphs like "his heart a drumbeat of jubilant despair" mix heightened language with earned emotional resonance rather than algorithmic cadence</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conceptual scaffolding (10+ story elements) shows at every seam. The "ancient Celtic village reimagined" remains an unmoored aesthetic gesture rather than narrative foundation</comment>
