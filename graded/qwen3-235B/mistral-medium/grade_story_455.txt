<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has layered traits and symbolic scars but motivation is implied rather than deeply explored; interactions are meaningful but limited by brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc from isolation to connection, but the secret agent escape route element disrupts internal consistency and pacing feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., humming shadows, cool coins) creates immersive mood; some elements (secret agent route) undercut cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (scars/guests, coins as inherited stories); ending delivers emotional closure while retaining mystery, elevated by lyrical, subtext-rich prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; some poetic phrasing risks pretension, but fresh metaphors (foreign coins as "whispers from unlive lives") and emotional nuance outweigh minor overwriting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the theme of shared burdens, though the secret agent detail feels extrinsic; concise format works but sacrifices deeper character/plot development.</comment>
