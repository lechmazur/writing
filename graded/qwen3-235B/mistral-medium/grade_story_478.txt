<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's 'openly secretive' trait and motivation to recover memories are present but lack psychological depth; her transformation into a healed healer is symbolic rather than emotionally resonant</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight mythic arc but relies heavily on abstract revelations rather than concrete narrative progression; connections between memory loss and resolution remain vague</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends botanical and storm imagery effectively, though the 'maelstrom' metaphor remains underdeveloped and some sensory descriptions verge on poetic generality</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors about growth/decay and cyclical time elevate the narrative; self-aware prose achieves emotional resonance through symbolic coherence despite minimal concrete characterization</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique setting details but occasionally falls into mystical narrative patterns; some phrases like 'wisdom pressed' risk aesthetic preciousness without descending into purple prose</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sufficiently cohesive with ambitious thematic intentions, but the brief length constrains full exploration of memory/identity themes; lacks definitive narrative breakthrough</comment>
