<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to rewrite guild laws is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflicts remain superficially rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through a series of symbolic actions but lacks strong cause-effect logic; thematic resolution feels abrupt despite thematic coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (vapor, mineral buildup) effectively evoke mood; timeframe "during baking" disconnects from atmospheric logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphorical connections offset by occasionally abstract language; "during baking" and underexplored Liora subplot suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements combine into a coherent whole but uneven integration (especially timeframe) weakens overall cohesion for top-tier standards.</comment>
