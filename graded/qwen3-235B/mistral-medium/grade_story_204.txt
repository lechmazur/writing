<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's profession as a professional cuddler is underused; motivation to overcome prejudice against touch is stated but lacks emotional depth. Reactions to the train punch are inconsistent—sweating palms and trembling but immediate acceptance of its metaphysical implications weakens psychological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure relies on contrived convergence of elements (spaceport, speech, vendor's disappearance). Pacing feels truncated—the acceptance speech's emotional stakes are underdeveloped despite tight word constraints. Cause-effect between the punch's warmth and thematic epiphany lacks logical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in isolated details (rusted beams, scent of old paper) but settings—the spaceport and market—aren't meaningfully integrated. Sensory details often default to vague abstractions ("whispering decay," "ancient novelty") rather than grounding specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (bridge hands, heartbeat punch) adds thematic resonance. The ending subverts the profession vs. object dichotomy effectively, though some told emotions ("felt light") undercut subtlety. Central theme of holding vs. using is coherent but could delve deeper into subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Phrases like "eyes like faded stars" and "decaying in reverse" border on cliché. The "vendor as mystical teacher" trope is predictable, though the punch's paradoxical tactile/intangible duality offers originality. Emotional shifts are occasionally over-explained, weakening nuanced resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by conflicting elements (spaceport vs. market; cuddler's physical intimacy vs. abstract lesson). Style prioritizes lyrical abstraction over narrative clarity at times. The ending's "lingering thought" feels intentional but superficial—thematic integration lacks penetrative depth.</comment>
