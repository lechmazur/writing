<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but lacks depth beyond symbolic representation of obsession; motivation is clear but underdeveloped through concrete backstory or tangible desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative structure is cyclical and symbolic rather than plot-driven; cohesion exists thematically but lacks traditional progression or stakes within the constrained form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere work symbiotically to mirror internal turmoil; evocative sensory details (glass, sea, lavender) deepen immersion and metaphorical resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Uses layered metaphor (tides, bellows, goose) to explore theme effectively; lyrical language enhances but occasionally verges on self-indulgent prose without undercutting emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in elemental interplay (e.g., bellows repurposed as metaphor); avoids clich√©s through vivid specificity despite familiar themes of obsession and loss.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a mood piece with strong thematic cohesion but limited narrative momentum; style and concept align more than character or plot engagement.</comment>
