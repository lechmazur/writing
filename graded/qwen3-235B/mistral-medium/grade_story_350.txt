<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's stated motivation (uncovering truth tied to personal trauma) and core trait ("irritatingly perfect truth") remain abstract and underexplored. Actions (stitching gown) stem from plot demands, not deeply human reasoning. "Back-alley puppeteer" profession lacks thematic connection to manipulation/vulnerability that could have enriched character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on vague connections between unrelated elements (stamps=symphony, tears=solving mystery). Cause-effect between remodelling the gown and revealing truth feels arbitrary. Pacing alternates between poetic inertia and rushed exposition, undermining coherence in a constrained word count. Ending introduces a confusing "last stamp" twist without proper setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere crafted through specific tactile details (brittle stamps, damp silk, trembling torchlight) creates vivid sensory immersion. Ancient Greek temple setting provides mystical weight but doesn't meaningfully intersect with puppeteer's identity or the gown's historical trauma. The "alone intimacy" tone is evocatively maintained through confined spaces and solitary actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (truth-as-symphony, tears-as-maps) create resonant metaphors, though occasionally tipping into overwrought prose. The ending's thematic contrast between "hearing vs feeling" truth offers satisfying philosophical weight. Central tension (personal vs historical truth) remains compelling but under-developed. Emotion is shown through physical reactions, though psychological depth is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (stamps as symphonic clues) but relies too heavily on AI-typical excessive metaphor stacking. The puppeteer's profession feels arbitrarily chosen rather than thematically necessary. "Gown tears" method avoids clich√© but connects clumsily to other elements. Frequent ornate descriptions occasionally become self-indulgent purple prose without advancing narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story maintains baseline cohesion through consistent atmospheric focus and central mystery. Elements feel more decorative than integrally interdependent - replacing "ancient temple" with "attic" or "stamp album" with "map" might cause minimal disruption. While conceptually ambitious, the brevity works as deliberate stylistic choice rather than limitation, though thematic development remains surface-level.</comment>
