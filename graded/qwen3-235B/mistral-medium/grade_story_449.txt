<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivation to birth philosophy remains abstract. Transformation from awkward to graceful is symbolic but poorly grounded in character agency or emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Meandering pacing with poetic beats but minimal arc. Plot exists as a circular metaphysical tableau rather than progression with clear stakes or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory alchemy between cosmic and domestic but fails to reconcile time dilation mechanics with thematic purpose. Atmospheric cohesion compensates for underdeveloped spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose rewards close reading with layered symbolism about creation. Occasionally sacrifices narrative momentum for aesthetic impact, particularly in climax handling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cosmic and domestic tropes. Avoids clich√© through unexpected combinations (e.g., dough/philosophy), though some phrases border on self-parodying lushness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive in concept execution despite length constraints. Leaves intriguing intellectual residue but lacks visceral emotional core to anchor speculative elements in relatable humanity.</comment>
