<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains opaque beyond surface traits; motivations hinted through poetic abstraction but lack emotional heft or behavioral specificity beyond brooding determination. “Softly militant” never manifests concretely.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structural coherence present but strained; poetic imagery overshadows plot mechanics. The cosmic repair goal lacks tangible stakes or logical progression from discovery to action. Abrupt shifts between contemplation and decisive “stitching” disrupt momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with tactile details (rust-breath, skeletal cities) and resonant contrasts between decay and fragile growth. The rooftop farm’s paradoxical vitality amplifies existential tension but underutilizes its metaphoric potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative language and cosmic subtext create lingering unease. Over-reliance on abstract metaphors (“gravity of loss”) dilutes emotional immediacy. The ending’s thematic resonance is undercut by vagueness; poetic momentum outweighs narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasionally slips into AI-like cadences (“crucible of reluctant awe”) and overwrought phrasing. Cosmic scale avoids clichés but leans on apocalyptic templates without fully subverting them. Emotional nuance feels implied rather than earned through character action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive poetic whole but strain narrative believability. The economy of language suits thematic compression, yet the brevity sacrifices character engagement. Lingering ambiguity feels intentional but risks emotional detachment.</comment>
