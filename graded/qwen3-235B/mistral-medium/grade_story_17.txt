<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Incantation chamber imagery evocative yet inconsistently rendered; atmosphere occasionally undermined by vague descriptors like "pulsed with energy" without visceral specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but retains faintly formulaic elements (witch as moral guide archetype); language mostly precise but occasionally slips into "brazen modesty" clich√©s without deeper cultural unpacking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with thematic ambition, yet overall impact diluted by predictable redemption framework and insufficient contextual distinctiveness.</comment>
