<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Minimal psychological depth; motivation (curing sister) clear but underserved by underdeveloped interiority and mechanical actions that lack human nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rapid, underdeveloped transitions between key moments strain coherence; conceptual ending resolves intellectually but lacks emotional/granular narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the storyâ€™s strongest element: synesthetic descriptors and spatial-temporal dissonance create immersive, haunting otherworldliness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric resonance in "spaces between" and "quantizing grief" elevated by lyrical style, though emotional impact diluted by abstract delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some fresh conceptual risks (quantum theory in grief) undercut by occasionally gaseous phrasing ("absolutely relative pause") and predictable metaphysical resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compelling thematic skeleton (healing through surrender) exists beneath occasionally strained prose; short length feels both intentional and limiting.</comment>
