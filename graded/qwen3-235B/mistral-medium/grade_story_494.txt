<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's arrogance and doubt are clearly established and motivate arc from smugness to humility; transformation is emotionally resonant. Voice through terse dialogue and introspective actions distinct yet consistent. Motivation to find purpose through authorization ties to thematic struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Routine action of authorization becomes vehicle for existential crisis. Pacing lingers on epiphany at cost of exterior plot momentum, but achieves full transformational arc within constraint. Logical cause-effect between tapestry symbolism, song, and realization maintained without artificial leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory immersion through calligraphy brushstrokes, tactile tapestry threads, haunting song melody. Courtyard setting as liminal space between tradition and personal change. Timeframe intensifies intimacy through breath-synchronized tension. Tone merges master's harsh wisdom with elegiac tenderness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (fading threads = unfulfilled potential) and paradoxical metaphor of "blade of time-honed voice" elevate beyond surface narrative. Subtext about authority earned through humility provokes reflection. Ending resonates as quiet triumph of self-mastery over external validation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of calligraphy discipline with warrior ethos avoids genre tropes. Some phrases ("spark where lights gone out") border on poetic cliche but redeemed through context. Emotional beats shown through specific actions (hilt grip tightening) rather than exposition. Style purposeful yet lyrical.</comment>
