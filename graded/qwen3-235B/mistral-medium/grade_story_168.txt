<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ruthlessness in flower arranging isn't clearly demonstrated through action, undermining core trait. Motivation to decode rock art remains abstract rather than visceral. Intellectually spontaneous decisions surface only in plot mechanics, not character voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stone circle framing provides circular structure but plot progression relies on mystical hand-waving rather than earned causality. Road trip conversations function more as symbolic device than narrative momentum. Pacing lulls in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere sustained through poetic descriptors (worn comb teeth, hum of car), but lacks grounding tactile details (texture of stones, exact light quality at dusk). Timeframe device feels underexploited beyond poetic interjection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose successfully evokes theme of surrender vs. control, while dialogue-as-discovery mechanism shows promise. However, emotional beats remain at surface level - reader intellectually grasps transformation rather than feeling it through embodied details.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Verdant language occasionally veers into purple prose excess ("burden of watching," "weave through spontaneous road trip conversations"). Avoids major clich√©s but similes like unfolding petals feel overly familiar. Character psychology leans schematic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration displays ingenuity (comb as map/archaeological tool hybrid) but sacrifices narrative cohesion. Brief format works against full thematic realization - themes resonate but lack concrete manifestation through character embodiment.</comment>
