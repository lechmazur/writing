<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation is stated but not convincingly enacted. "AI in a toaster" trope isn't leveraged into meaningful personality or limitation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structure exists but lacks momentum. Symbolic progression replaces coherent cause/effect; cyclical form feels more decorative than narratively vital within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rich but inconsistent imagery - Sumerian palace mixed with anachronistic tech creates dissonance rather than cohesion. Sensory details overwhelm substance; tone of "shouting silence" underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose with striking metaphors ("binary verse") and resonant ending. However, emotional beats rely heavily on poetic abstraction rather than earned character connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept mixing Sumerian history with AI archiving avoids overt clich√©s, but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("circuits pulsing in harmony"). Nuanced tension between preservation and evolution is undercut by overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Visually captivating but structurally uneven. Assigned elements are often juxtaposed rather than integrated; brevity occasionally highlights thematic ambition but often leaves ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
