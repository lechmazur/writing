<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is archetypal rather than deeply developed; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance. The "honestly strange" attribute is illustrated through symbolic actions more than internal complexity, and the butter churn's significance feels more thematic than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single symbolic action with limited cause/effect complexity. The ascent via poster tears lacks concrete logic, and the word count constraint creates a telescoped resolution that feels conceptually satisfying but narratively compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of the decaying space station and dying world create a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like flaking paper and unraveling gravity effectively immerse readers, though the setting occasionally leans on post-apocalyptic clichés.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (roots of the last tree, cracked illusions) and lyrical prose elevate storytelling impact. The ending balances triumph and melancholy, though emotional beats occasionally rely on abstract phrases rather than subtle, embodied reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strikes a balance between poetic language and thematic clarity, avoiding overt clichés but occasionally tipping into ornate abstraction ("aloof passion"). Subverts dystopian tropes through surreal imagery but occasionally falters in emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Story feels deliberately concise and conceptually unified, though the 500-word frame leaves some elements underexplored. Leverages symbolic elements effectively but lacks deeper narrative layers that could enhance memorability.</comment>
