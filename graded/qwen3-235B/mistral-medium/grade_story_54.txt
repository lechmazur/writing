<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains static, defined by checklist of traits rather than organic development; motivations stated but disconnected from specific actions; emotional weight of the letter feels unearned due to lack of backstory or emotional subtext</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure or narrative progression; no clear beginning/middle/end; tension dissipates into vague atmospheric gestures rather than driving action; cause/effect relationships obscured by abstract language</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting vividly rendered with strong sensory details (peeling walls, rusted games) but disconnected from character's actions; "elegant chaos" concept manifested visually but not thematically; atmosphere dominant over narrative function</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Language prioritizes poetic abstraction over emotional engagement; literary devices (constellations, vibrations) lack symbolic cohesion; ending resolves nothing, becoming self-parody of ambiguous "literary" closures; no discernible theme emerges</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on ornamental phrasing and clich√©d metaphors ("weight of forgotten joy," "symphony of unseen forces"); characters feel like archetypal pulp constructs rather than human beings; concept layering appears formulaic rather than purposeful</comment>
