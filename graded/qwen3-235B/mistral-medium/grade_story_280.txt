<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to master strategy is present but underdeveloped; internal conflict lacks concrete manifestation through action or dialogue, relying on abstract metaphors rather than psychological depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story achieves atmospheric cohesion but struggles with elemental integration; some assigned components feel thematically superficial rather than organically necessary to narrative architecture.</comment>
