<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but transformation feels abrupt; Lira’s resilience stems from her orphan status, which drives her quest, but emotional depth remains thin despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression from temple entry to self-discovery is cohesive, but pacing stumbles during the abrupt shift to her final metamorphosis; cause-effect logic holds within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: sensory details (figs, thorns, decaying vines) create haunting beauty; contrast between temple’s decay and city’s smog deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (curse/brooch as emotional inheritance, thorns as clinging past) enrich the narrative; ending’s thematic weight is undercut by overly didactic final lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visionary elements resist formula, but “streetwise orphan” and “keeper” tropes border on cliché; similes like “brooch’s echo as lullaby” occasionally veer into sentimental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements merge to create a vivid, thematically coherent whole; brevity feels intentional but leaves some character nuance unexplored, risking superficiality.</comment>
