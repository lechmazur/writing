<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character development relies heavily on abstract description over concrete actions; motivations rooted in insecurity are clear but lack nuanced human complexity, emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure implies arc but lacks narrative propulsion; cause-effect between actions (jab, realization) is abrupt, pacing stumbles between poetic interludes and plot progression, coherence hinges on atmosphere over logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive setting with vivid sensory details (hollow jar, pulsing brain), but the "secret agent" framework clashes with existential themes, undermining atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext evokes existential dread; lyrical prose elevates emotional impact, though occasional purple prose and inconsistent showing-over-telling detract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some repetitive phrases and overwrought imagery ("echo of footsteps") suggest AI-like patterns; avoids clich√©s but tone risks pretension, emotional resonance is genuine despite stylistic excesses.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (fractured self, futile pursuit) but unevenly serve narrative; constrained form works for poetic brevity yet struggles to fully integrate plot and setting.</comment>
