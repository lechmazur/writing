<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's fading champion status is present but underexplored; motivation to prolong purpose is clear but abstract, lacking concrete emotional grounding or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot leans on symbolic transformation rather than traditional structure; lacks narrative momentum and cause-effect logic despite poetic resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (origami as consciousness, broken time) and lyrical prose create lasting resonance; emotional impact emerges indirectly through texture over direct engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Conceptually inventive with fresh metaphors but occasionally veers into obscurity; avoids tropes yet risks alienation through excessive abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but overly reliant on style over substance; the thematic fusion of elements lingers intellectually without visceral emotional payoff.</comment>
