<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment> Motivation (heritage reclamation) is clear but thinly explored; character's "bored excitement" lacks consistent embodiment and internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment> Compact arc exists, but the misdelivered doll device strains credibility. Pacing feels rushed - the station awakening and legacy reveal occur without necessary emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment> Vivid sensory details (ozone, shifting soil) establish mood, but sci-fi/magic blend feels underutilized - the space station's function in the family's lore remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment> Uses legacy theme effectively with holographic land and crumbling doll symbolism, but emotional payoff is weakened by surface-level treatment of transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment> While genre blend is original, combines familiar "chosen one" arcs with "magic object" tropes. Writing style avoids clich√©d phrases but occasionally veers into poetic vagueness rather than precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment> Elements form functional whole but lack surprising synergy. Space station and doll head integration feels more practical than inspired. Impact lingers briefly but superficially.</comment>
