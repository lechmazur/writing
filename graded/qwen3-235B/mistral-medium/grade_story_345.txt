<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is poetic but lacks tangible motivation; his confusion and defiance float abstractly without grounding in concrete actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression—a static vignette of existential brooding; snow patterns as a guide feel arbitrary, and the ending negates momentum by abandoning all narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and original, with bean stalks-as-prison metaphors and tactile frost imagery enhancing the existential tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and layered symbolism (abacus, snow, bean stalks) offer thematic resonance; lacks emotional urgency despite aesthetic strength.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("hush of fate unraveling") and repetitive existential clichés undercut originality; metaphors are vivid but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Beautifully crafted but narratively inert; cohesion exists superficially but lacks the compulsive readability or transformative impact required for top-tier publication.</comment>
