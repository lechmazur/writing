<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to handed-down stories and rebellion feel coherent but lack concrete emotional depth; the noble’s "dazed" quality remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing effectively balances poetic reflection with cyclical plot structure; however, the transition from defiance to transformation feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (sound garden, chalk dust as stardust) but the "composer’s garden" and timeframe between lectures lack deeper integration with the core themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like the chalk-as-talisman and cosmic dance are evocative, and the ending resonates thematically, but emotional stakes could be more viscerally conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise and lyrical prose avoid overt clichés, but some phrases ("storm in his chest") border on conventionality; occasional ornate abstraction risks distancing the reader.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a self-aware narrative about storytelling’s power; the brevity enhances metaphorical resonance while leaving room for thematic reflection.
