<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually atmospheric but lacks psychological depth or distinct voice; actions align with assigned traits but motivation feels abstract rather than emotionally rooted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves minimal coherence through symbolic progression (sweeping as revival), but the word limit compresses emotional stakes; connections between action and transformation feel intuitive rather than structurally rigorous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in decay and nostalgia with concrete details (dust, cold, starlight), though the empire transitions timeframe remains under-integrated; atmosphere often substitutes for concrete contextual depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery ("starlit conversations," "bones shifting") creates haunting lyricism; theme of reclaiming forgotten potential resonates through subtext, though emotional payoff leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Subverts typical "heroic salvager" tropes through melancholy focus, but occasionally relies on ornate metaphors ("gleefully morose laughter") and generic descriptors ("crisp nostalgia"); emotional nuance present but inconsistently realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mixed cohesion - assigned elements create a framework for poetic meditation, but narrative structure feels more assembled than organically unified; atmosphere lingers more than thematic content.</comment>
