<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is enigmatic but underdeveloped; traits like "cardsharp" lack sufficient narrative impact, though motivation ties to central object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but pacing issues in climax; transitions between dream logic and physical action strain coherence within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly visceral—mist and island evoke tangible dread; every sensory detail serves the haunting, liminal tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as fate, mirror as self-confrontation) resonate, but resolution leans on abstract symbolism over emotional specificity; ending lingers but lacks visceral punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("boisterously quiet"); dream motif and doppelgänger twist add originality but aren't fully destabilizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but thematic weight unevenly distributed; brevity works for mystique but undermines character and causal clarity.</comment>
