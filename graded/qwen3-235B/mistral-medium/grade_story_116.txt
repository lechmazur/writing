<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot simulates progression through metaphor accumulation, but lacks tangible conflict or resolution; circular structure within tight word limit feels more atmospheric than narratively coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details create a hauntingly original world; setting functions as character itself, with the sky-lounge and city below operating as metaphysical extensions of the protagonist's psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphorical language elevates the narrative; tension between time and boundary themes creates intellectual resonance; ending achieves poetic closure while maintaining mystery.</comment>
