<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's death wish and motive are clear but feel overly abstract. Personality remains elusive despite poetic descriptions. Motivation drives action but lacks humanizing contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cyclical structure effective but heavily reliant on symbolic repetition rather than earned tension. Pacing well-managed within constraints though some transitions feel concept-driven over character-driven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eerie setting and sensory details (waterfall's mist, ice cracks) are vivid but worldbuilding remains cryptic. Atmosphere supports tone but fails to ground the abstract concept of 'hidden societies' in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and thematic tension between life/death are strong, but overreliance on metaphor dilutes emotional impact. Ending feels conceptually satisfying yet emotionally distant, evoking admiration over connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through surreal symbolism. Some phrases risk becoming 'purple prose' but maintain stylistic consistency. Fresh metaphors (e.g., radio static as symphony) elevate originality despite occasionally mechanical transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively but prioritize thematic resonance over narrative urgency. The short form feels intentional, with the cyclical ending suggesting depth but leaving some character motivations underexplored.</comment>
