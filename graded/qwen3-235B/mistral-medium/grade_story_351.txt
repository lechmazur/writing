<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Poet's rebelliousness and motivation to remember the forgotten are consistent but shallow; lacks depth beyond symbolic traits, no internal conflict or evolution shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Minimalist structure functions but feels static; circular progression (solving riddle to reading names) implies resolution yet lacks traditional arc; pacing deliberate but risks narrative stagnation in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ivy, rust, scent) create haunting atmosphere; setting actively shapes tone and theme rather than backdrop; decay mirrors erasure of unremembered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sundial, trembling ivy) enhances thematic resonance; poetic language risks preciousness but mostly serves emotional weight; ending achieves poignant circularity without feeling trite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conceptually fresh approach to memory/erasure avoids clich√©; metaphors specific yet accessible; occasional phrases verge on ornate but generally maintain purposeful clarity; emotional impact through gesture rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements work symbiotically; brevity amplifies elegiac tone; lingering resonance from cyclical structure and symbolic payoffs; character remains archetypal but serves thematic purpose.</comment>
