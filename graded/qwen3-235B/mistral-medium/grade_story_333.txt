<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's defiance is clear but sincerity feels underexplored; motivation to preserve traditions is consistent but internal conflict lacks depth. His confrontation with fear of meaninglessness is conceptually stated but emotionally thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure (entry → revelation → ritual → departure), but the climactic ritual and resolution feel rushed. Cause-effect logic holds, but pacing falters slightly in conveying emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Settings blend evocatively: damp stone, ghostly light, and "shifting shadows" amplify dread and mystery. The haunted passage’s atmosphere powerfully mirrors the protagonist’s psychological struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor ("living echoes in the stones") and subtext, but themes (tradition vs. erasure) are occasionally stated rather than shown. Ending offers satisfying closure but lacks lingering ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Solid descriptive language avoids cliché in places, but phrases like "braided bitterness of betrayal" lean toward purple prose. Tropes (haunted passages, rebel hero) are familiar but serviceably reworked through atmospheric detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story coheres technically but leans heavily on assigned elements as narrative scaffolding rather than organic components. Memorable imagery and thematic resonance are undercut by overreliance on dramatic abstraction over concrete emotional beats.</comment>
