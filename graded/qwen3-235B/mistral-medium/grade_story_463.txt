<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's dry wit is stylistically present but lacks psychological depth; motivations tied to eroding promises are implied rather than earned, with actions only superficially aligned to "learning traditional methods" through ghostly dance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from confiscating rope to dance climax with cause-effect logic, but the compressed arc feels schematic; the "reckless precision" of the dance drives momentum yet resolution comes abruptly without earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with salt, fog, and flickering ghosts creating palpable decay; the rope's tactile symbolism and lighthouse's groaning light immerse the reader, though the shared dance's emotional weight isn't fully contextualized within the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like rope-as-promise resonate, and the dance-as-survival theme adds subtext; elegant prose elevates impact, though emotional resonance feels curated rather than organically felt, with some phrases leaning toward polished abstraction over visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through surreal unions (e.g., dry wit + haunted dance); language is purposeful with fresh metaphors ("voice like wind through broken glass"), though the lighthouse's traditional haunting occasionally verges on clich√© despite elevated execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere through persistent thematic echoes (erosion, reckoning), but the story leans on poetic abstraction at the expense of narrative grit; brevity amplifies atmospheric effectiveness but leaves character motivations underexplored.</comment>
