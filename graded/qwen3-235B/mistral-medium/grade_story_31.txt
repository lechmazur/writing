<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on descriptors rather than actions demonstrating 'endearingly irritating' qualities. Motivation for connection is consistent but under-explored through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; some transitions between planting the key and the stranger interaction lack organic development within the tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong cyberpunk imagery with holographic vines and neon contrasts, though 'hush between heartbeats' concept feels forced. Sensory details effectively immerse but occasionally overwhelm coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memorable metaphor of the garden as living memory resonates emotionally, though dialogue leans toward poetic abstraction over grounded character interaction. Theme of reconnection is clear but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally defaults to 'lyrical' phrasing over original imagery. The key's symbolic role avoids overused metaphors, while cyberpunk elements lean toward genre tropes with modest subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but struggle with narrative weight; the brevity sharpens focus on atmosphere over character depth, leaving some ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
