<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but driven more by archetype than organic nuance; "gloomy" traits don't evolve beyond surface-level despondency despite pivotal actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Compressed arc from obsession to redemption feels abrupt rather than earned; plot progression relies on poetic transitions rather than sustained cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and evocative—dry skulls humming lullabies, orchards humming with prophetic tension—but occasionally veers into decorative overkill.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery-rich narrative creates lingering emotion through metaphor over plot; symbolic cohesion (e.g., decaying orchard as emotional/physical barrenness) is strong but occasionally saccharine.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("thread stitching past to future") elevate material, but phrases like "machines sang children to sleep" border on nostalgic trope repetition; tone occasionally wavers between mythic and melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story survives thematic cohesion but leans too heavily on atmospheric weight to compensate for underdeveloped human conflicts; ambitious but unevenly executed.</comment>
