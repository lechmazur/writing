<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sufficiently uses symbolic depth, but lacks nuanced human contradictions; internal conflict hinted but not fully embodied in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive within constraints, but relies on abstract transitions over concrete cause-effect; key revelations lack visceral narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative decay and cosmic hum amplify mood, but setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active participant in character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and thematic resolve elevate impact, though some emotions stated rather than embedded in action (e.g., "joyful loneliness").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Creative imagery avoids clich√©s but occasionally descends into ornateness; narrative logic mostly tight but edges toward AI-generated abstraction at climactic moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but rarely surprise; brevity enhances focus but limits character/textural development. Lingering thematic resonance is modest.</comment>
