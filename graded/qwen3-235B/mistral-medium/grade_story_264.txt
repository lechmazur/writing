<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alchemist's traits shape plot but remain archetypal rather than deeply individualized. Motivation clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth beyond thematic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structures celestial transformation effectively within constraints, but the pivotal projector mechanism feels metaphysically vague. Pacing uneven during magical climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sterile observatory contrasted with alchemist's magic creates tangible atmosphere. Sensory details vivid but underdeveloped - the "hum" and "cracked lens" demand more physical grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery of sky-as-canvas resonates. Ending resonates thematically but leans on familiar "magic vs. science" dichotomy rather than subverting it. Metaphors rich but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story avoids major clich√©s but occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over character logic. Some transitions between wonder moments could be less reliant on mystical hand-waving.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively despite brevity. The "touched sky" concept lingers particularly well. Tight construction elevates constraint into deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
