<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; Elias' curse defines his dialogue but not deeper psychological complexity, while the woman's transformation serves plot more than emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean cause-effect progression with poetic momentum, but the abrupt petrification climax and lack of narrative aftermath within the word limit create a truncated arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vividly rendered haunted booth and moonlit imagery immersive; atmospheric details like fluttering banners and birds enhance mood through precise sensory contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric depth (truth as shattering force) and haunting final lines deliver thematic resonance, but some emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction over concrete characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Language occasionally borders on ornate clich√©s ("tapestry of fate"), but the central metaphor of petrification-as-enlightenment offers conceptual originality within gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements cohere around theme but lack interconnectivity; the compressed format sacrifices emotional payoff despite successful tonal cohesion and haunting imagery.</comment>
