<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's naivety is consistently portrayed as strength but lacks psychological depth; motivation to "mend broken" remains abstract despite driving her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows ritual arc but lacks stakes or consequences; pacing is lyrical but cause/effect relationships between humming, fragments, and societal reaction remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (light, hum, tension) create mystical atmosphere, but "virtual essence" jars with medieval vault imagery; tone remains cohesive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bridge between mortal/divine" and cyclical structure elevate; thematic resonance with brokenness/holism exists but feels derivative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s via "virtual" juxtaposition but relies on mystical summoner archetype; poetic abstraction occasionally veils underdeveloped tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</question><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated; elevated language and metaphorical ambition outweigh predictable structural patterns.</comment>
