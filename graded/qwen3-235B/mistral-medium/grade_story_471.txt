<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (mapping ghost towns for redemption) ties to growth, but transformation feels slightly rushed and underexplored. Dialogue and internal conflict hint at depth but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from encounter to revelation, but the word limit strains extended emotional payoff. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic coherence; pacing falters slightly in key transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable—mist, rust, and music create an immersive, haunting world. Sensory details (e.g., "splintered wood," "lens warming") deepen tone. Setting and mood intricately mirror character arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (lens as choice, ghosts as memory). Ending delivers thematic resonance, but emotional beats lean on abstract phrasing ("sharp as a vow unkept") rather than fully realized subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar motifs (sage musician, haunted hero). Language is purposeful but occasionally ventures into ornate description ("notes atomizing into fragments"). Nuanced emotion is implied but inconsistently embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements align structurally, though integration varies—camera lens and "atomize" shine, while "bold vulnerability" and "reckless hunter" lean on trope-adjacent execution. Lingering impression is evocative but uneven in execution.</comment>
