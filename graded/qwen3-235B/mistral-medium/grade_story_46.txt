<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (learning dream language) is clear and consistent, but emotional flatness undermines depth despite thematic justification; blankness both strengthens and weakens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (rumor pursuit → disillusionment), but tight word limit causes rushed transitions; dream language's twist feels abrupt despite solid thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (glowing waterfalls, sentient ferns) creates immersive, haunting atmosphere; sensory details masterfully blend surrealism with tangible physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "precise madness") and layered symbolism (ring as knowledge conduit) enrich narrative; ending's subtextual resolution elevates thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through idiosyncratic concepts (dream language's danger), but occasional abstract phrasing (e.g., "orchard of secrets") risks vagueness; emotional restraint works thematically but could feel detached.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements tightly woven into cohesive whole; tonal consistency and poetic economy of prose suggest deliberate brevity, leaving lingering existential unease.</comment>
