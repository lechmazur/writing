<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with 'analytically playful' shaping his investigative drive. His internal conflict between obsession and sacrifice is understated but present, though the transformation into the curse lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression through unlocking farmhouse secrets drives momentum, but the condensed structure leaves some transitions between discoveries feeling abrupt. The closed loop of beginning/end (holding tooth/destroying tooth) works, though pacing feels slightly uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through contrasts (decaying orchard/neon hub) and sensory details. The 'sorrowful melody' of the curse and tactile descriptions of the tooth immerse readers, though the futuristic setting's potential remains underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tooth as legacy) and lyrical prose elevate impact. The ending's transformation is emotionally resonant, though explicit emotional tellings ('gleeful sorrow') occasionally undercut subtext. Themes of obsession and symbiosis emerge effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original subversion of 'curse' trope through symbiotic absorption. Avoids clich√©s with the tooth's physical/spiritual fusion, though 'futuristic hub' feels like a missed opportunity for cyberpunk contrast. Language remains purposeful despite occasional ornateness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole despite tight word limits. The fusion of orchard/human curse delivers memorable conceptual resonance, though tighter integration of setting elements could enhance narrative necessity.</comment>
