<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's obsession and transformation are clear but psychological depth remains superficial; motivations implied rather than explored, with "theoretically playful" attribute poorly integrated into actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Concise arc from obsession to revelation works within constraints but lacks nuanced progression; cause-effect coherent though occasionally abrupt, with pacing managing tension despite limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like damp wood and jungle whispers create immersive contrasts; Victorian/jungle setting enhances themes but timeframe ("studying") remains underexploited despite sensory richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (caps as soul fragments) and thematic tension between vulnerability/madness resonate powerfully; ending transcends potential clich√© through symbolic cohesion, though emotional impact occasionally diluted by overt telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally edge toward purple prose but generally serve mood; originality shines in symbolic cap usage and jungle-parlor juxtaposition despite predictable descent-into-madness structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Narrative cohesion maintained despite multiplicity of elements; brevity feels intentional but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration; memorable imagery leaves lingering impression without profound philosophical resonance.</comment>
