<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape simulation is clear, but inner conflict lacks depth; actions serve concept more than personality; 'grim' tone dominates, but emotional nuance is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows from isolation to escape, but pacing feels uneven due to dense abstraction; cause-effect between melodies and simulation weakens under scrutiny; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensorial decay and light/dark contrasts masterfully evoke desolation; ghost town mirrors character's solitude; atmospheric coherence occasionally overpowers narrative clarity in critical moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (melodies as bridges, remembering as weapon) add intellectual heft; ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional catharsis; subtext about reality's fragility is compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through poetic abstraction but borders on pretension; fresh coin-melody concept contrasts with overused 'simulated reality' trope; emotional impact feels stated rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution; experimental style enhances atmosphere at prose readability's expense; lingering questions about reality outweigh emotional residue.</comment>
