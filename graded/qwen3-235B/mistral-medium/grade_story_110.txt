<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is consistent but thinly realized; "quietly flambowant" lacks concrete demonstration. The assassin's actions metaphorically align with transmuting pain into art, but interiority remains elusive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Meandering yet purposeful pacing; the circular structure (lantern's decay/rebirth) provides cohesion, but cause-effect logic is sometimes submerged beneath poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in the shop’s damp decay, where moss and grease become extensions of the characters' emotional states. Tone and setting meld masterfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegiac symbolism (swans, clocks, ink) elevates the narrative; the ending’s dual emphasis on erasure and persistence strikes a haunting, ambiguous chord.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush but disciplined prose avoids becoming self-indulgent; tropes are artfully reconceived (e.g., the artisan-assassin) despite occasional near-overwrought metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere within a deliberate, if occasionally opaque, aesthetic; the brevity amplifies the story's melancholic focus but risks superficial engagement with "domestic mysteries."</comment>
