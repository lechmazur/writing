<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is present but rushed; protagonist's spinelessness and transformation lack psychological depth, and the mentor figure feels archetypal rather than distinctly individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure has clear arc but uneven pacing; the prophecy's resolution feels abrupt, while the tight word limit creates compressed cause-effect logic that occasionally strains credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details but setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than integral narrative force; the map room's symbolic potential remains underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thematic resonance (silence vs. prophecy) carry emotional weight, though occasional ornate prose risks veering into purple prose; ending lacks full thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic tropes through strong metaphoric use (key as compass, dollhouse as labyrinth) but contains slightly formulaic phrasing in atmospheric descriptions; emotional subtext feels partially surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly integrated into narrative logic; brevity works thematically but limits deeper exploration of relationships between assigned components.</comment>
