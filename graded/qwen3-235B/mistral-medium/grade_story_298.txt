<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lian’s duality (chameleon nature) is conceptually intriguing but lacks psychological complexity; motivations are clear but underexplored. His “rationally impulsive” actions feel imposed rather than organically revealed through choices. Emotional depth is implied but not fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc from discovery of the dress to the princess’s revelation is coherent but formulaic. Cause/effect relationships are logical (the dress reveals the truth), but pacing feels rushed within the word limit. The ending achieves resolution but lacks structural innovation or tension beyond predictable “twist” tropes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with vivid sensory details (sunlight/debris, tattered doll). The post-oil decay and palace’s “whispers” enrich the mood. However, the reimagined Chinese palace’s specific cultural textures are underdeveloped—feels more archetypal than authentically grounded in its assigned setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical imagery (“doll’s dress as relic”) and emotional pathos in the princess’s fate. The “anxious serenity” tone is conveyed through lyrical prose, but deeper subtext (e.g., societal decay vs. personal redemption) remains underexplored. Dialogue is minimal and perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic palace and chameleon actor are original but occasionally verge on overwrought lyricism (“gilded lies,” “fractured light”). Some descriptors (“rationally impulsive”) feel contrived. The central conflict (truth vs. illusion) is compelling but not executed with sufficient nuance to avoid melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces around its assigned elements but struggles to fully integrate some (e.g., timeframe). The brief format works for episodic mystery but limits thematic depth. Lingering melancholy is effective, but the narrative’s ambition exceeds its structural cohesion.</comment>
