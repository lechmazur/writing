<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poorly developed character beyond surface metaphors; motivation stated but not earned through action or internal conflict. "Underwater welder" profession isn't meaningfully integrated into his time-manipulation role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear structure but lacks narrative stakes or escalation; "unraveling" moment feels abrupt and underdeveloped. Plot progression relies heavily on vague magical realism without clear logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vivid but dissonant imagery; nightclub/planetarium fusion lacks ecological coherence. Sensory details (salt, ozone) exist in isolation rather than creating immersive logic. Time-crossing setting underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic weightlifting, but emotional resonance is superficial. Ending's thematic ambiguity works better than the underbaked middle. Tension between "mending" and "unraveling" conceptually strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional fresh combinations (welding time) amid familiar tropes. Purple prose threatens but atmospheric cohesion prevails. Character psychology remains opaque despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent assembly of disparate elements with inconsistent thematic payoff. Some imaginative sparks but lacks editorial rigor to justify word choices. Lingers more through setting than narrative.</comment>
