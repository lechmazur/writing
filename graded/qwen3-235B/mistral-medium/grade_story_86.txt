<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's apprehension and excellence briefly inform his struggle but lack psychological depth; motivations feel abstract rather than rooted in lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has circularity (festival imagery bookends the story) but pacing feels compressed, relying on lyrical abstraction over concrete cause-effect progression; abrupt shifts blur logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere powerfully merges cyberpunk grit with mythic undertones; neon lights vs. candlelight juxtaposition creates visceral tension; sensory details immerse but occasionally overwhelm coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (candle as truth, arrows as data) evoke visceral themes, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; ending leans on poetic resolution rather than earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Blends genres inventively but falls into AI-like tendencies (overwrought metaphors, sudden festival-data center contrast); avoids complete predictability but trades precision for surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists but feels strainedâ€”elements operate in parallel rather than symbiotic interdependence; style occasionally undermines narrative clarity despite poetic ambition.</comment>
