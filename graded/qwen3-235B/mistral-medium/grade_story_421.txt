<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character concept is evocative but remains abstract; motivations implied through metaphors rather than concrete actions or internal conflicts that feel earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loose structure prioritizes atmosphere over momentum; beginning/middle/end coherence weakened by underdeveloped stakes and uneven pacing of revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (petal fragrances, gleaming wheel) and symbolic contrasts between nature and duty create immersive atmosphere with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (wheel as destiny/guidance) and evocative imagery effectively, but emotional impact diluted by reliance on poetic abstraction over grounded specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some phrasing borders on ornate ("anguished joy"), and character psychology feels overly simplified despite ambitious thematic framing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptual unity exists but execution lacks narrative urgency; poetic flourishes sometimes overshadow character/story integration required for prestige publication.</comment>
