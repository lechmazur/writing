<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters are atmospheric but shallow; motivations (truth-seeking, rebellion) exist but lack psychological depth. Telepathic stone body incongruent with "heart" metaphor. Dialogue feels like thematic exposition rather than genuine interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows predictable rebellion arc with insufficient build-up. Rebellion planning happens through vague descriptions. Climax lacks emotional weight due to compressed timeline. Cause-effect chain exists but feels mechanistic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Steampunk setting established through sensory clich√©s (gears, smog) without unique worldbuilding. Atmosphere supports themes but fails to deepen character logic or political oppression. Ink's glowing reveal strains internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance in hair tie, ink-as-truth gestures. Ending achieves thematic closure (search over victory) yet melodramatic execution undermines impact. Writing style occasionally transcendent but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attempts originality through metaphor-layering (ink as movement, stone hearts) but risks pretension. Some overwrought phrasing ("steam's hum warm yet weary") borders on purple prose. Emotional subtext implied rather than authentically rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements service themes unevenly: hair tie and recognition light function symbolically, while "weatherizing" and gloomy cheerfulness feel imposed. Premature ending provokes thought but sacrifices narrative cohesion.</comment>
