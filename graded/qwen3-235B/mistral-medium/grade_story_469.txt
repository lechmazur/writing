<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character traits exist but lack psychological complexity; motivation is implied rather than dramatized. The skeleton key offers symbolic weight but doesn't fully integrate the "logically emotional" dimension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing generally controlled but resolution feels abrupt; countdown creates urgency but connections between early atmosphere and final revelation remain underdeveloped within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting creates mood through sensory details but lacks integration with core concepts; garden scent as atmospheric motif feels disconnected from spatial logic of tunnel mapping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective imagery and symbolic resonance but relies heavily on familiar literary devices; theme about bearing witness gains emotional traction but feels derivative rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Contains poetic moments but leans on conventional tropes (haunted keys, whispering galleries); atmospheric elements sometimes overwhelm substance; some passages risk becoming self-consciously "literary" rather than organically affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but struggles with balancing assigned elements; world-building feels deliberate yet constrained; ending provides resolution with lingering thematic questions but lacks narrative innovation.</comment>
