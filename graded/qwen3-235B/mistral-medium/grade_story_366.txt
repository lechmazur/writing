<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Promising use of telepathy and 'noble fool' traits, but motivations remain vague and emotional depth underdeveloped despite poetic language. Internal consistency weakened by underexplored contradictions between her efficiency and inefficiency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moments of elegant plotting through the frost-journal connection, but the climactic revelation feels rushed. Structural symmetry exists but lacks propulsion; cause-effect relationships between decoding phases insufficiently developed within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking sensory contrasts between mechanized dock and organic ice patterns, but atmosphere lacks immersive specificity. The cusp-of-seasons motif is effective yet inconsistently woven through the workers' interactions and Lena's perception.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</comment><grade>Strong metaphoric framework (ice as code) supports thematic resonance, but emotional impact muted by excessive abstraction. The ending's philosophical weight feels earned but under-embodied, with tension between individual purpose and systemic expectation underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids standard tropes in its lyrical fusion of blue-collar machinery and cryptic naturalism. Some purple prose tendencies ("symphony of labor") undercut authenticity. Original in concept combination but occasionally sacrifices narrative logic for poetic effect.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole but lack narrative urgency. The compression works for motif reinforcement but weakens character arc and conflict resolution. Memorable imagery outpaces emotional or philosophical profundity.</comment>
