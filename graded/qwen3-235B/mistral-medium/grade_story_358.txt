<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's desperation is present but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack psychological complexity. Minimal internal conflict beyond stated yearning for legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear movement from obsession to surrender, but pacing feels compressed; some cause-effect transitions (e.g., mirror's grasp) lack sufficient groundwork within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse and mirrors create a visceral, haunting atmosphere; sensory details and tone work in unison to amplify dread and isolation effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolism (shattered mirrors, frost, warm fragment) deliver thematic weight; emotional impact is undercut by occasionally cryptic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition and subversion of "power" tropes show ingenuity, but some phrasing (e.g., "sanctified dread") skirts clich√©; tone occasionally prioritizes ornateness over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive in blending elements toward a contemplative resolution; the brevity enhances thematic resonance but sacrifices deeper exploration of character and conflict.</comment>
