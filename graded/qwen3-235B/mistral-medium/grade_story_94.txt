<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations feel philosophically stated rather than organically demonstrated; interiority is stylized but underdeveloped. Her profession as a heartbreak counselor isn't deeply interrogated to reveal contradictions or complexities in her own emotional stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc of release, but the integration of time travel lacks narrative weight. Transitions between introspective elements have a tendency toward poetic abstraction rather than concrete cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambient sensory details and atmospheric coherence are strong, but the setting's metaphysical properties (reflection pool/time travel mechanics) remain frustratingly abstract, undermining the story's grounding in reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story employs rich metaphor and thematically resonant imagery to explore emotional weight, but occasionally loses impact through overly abstract phrasing that distances the reader from visceral engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on clichéd existential pondering ("echoes of a time traveler's misstep") and the balance between poetic abstraction and concrete characterization sometimes wavers, but the emotional core maintains authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack structural integration—time travel's presence feels decorative rather than functionally transformative. The brevity serves atmospheric goals better than narrative complexity.</comment>
