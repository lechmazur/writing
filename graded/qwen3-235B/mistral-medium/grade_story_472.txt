<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's matchmaker identity is underexplored; motivations are hinted at but lack depth, with actions driven by vague cosmic imperatives rather than organic personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elegant circular structure undermined by rushed development—key revelations feel abrupt rather than earned, with underdeveloped transitions between critical plot beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (engine hums, flag ripples, tactile book decay) create an immersive, haunting environment that powerfully embodies the theme of latent narratives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vivid imagery occasionally lapses into familiar tropes (e.g., "whispers of the cosmos") rather than consistently original metaphors, with some overwrought descriptive clusters diluting narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in concept but uneven in execution—combines strong atmospheric unity with unresolved character and thematic ambiguity that weakens definitive interpretative power.</comment>
