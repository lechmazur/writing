<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's 'obituary for the living' profession and rebelliousness are stated but underexplored; motivations feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded, and the mask's influence on his identity remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from quest to transformation, but the revolutionary context and pipe organ's power are introduced without full causal integration, creating slight narrative dissonance in the word-constrained climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The giant's bookshelf and pipe organ chamber create an intoxicating tactile atmosphere, but the 'revolution' timeframe remains atmospheric rather than structurally intertwined with the story's emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (labyrinth/mask/art as rebellion) and resonant imagery (dissolving stages, humming resonance) elevate the narrative; the ending's interplay of fragility and defiance lingers thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through inventive pairings (bookshelf labyrinth, organ-driven magic), though occasional phrases ("rebels with a song") and the mask's personification border on overfamiliarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>All required elements are woven into a cohesive mythic tapestry without feeling imposed, though the revolution's thematic potential and the labyrinth metaphor could be more deeply excavated within the brevity.</comment>
