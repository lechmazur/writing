<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are abstract and inconsistently tied to her profession as an astronomer; emotional shifts occur without sufficient psychological grounding, relying on metaphor over human behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague cause-effect (snowflake patterns melting ice idols); circular structure satisfies cohesion minimally but sacrifices momentum in its haste to mythologize resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting's crystalline decay and lighthouse symbolism create haunting sensory immersion; atmosphere masterfully reinforces emotional desolation and fragile hope through tactile ice/snow imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (e.g., sorrow crystallizing into ice) elevate themes of creation/destruction cycles, though emotional payoff feels more intellectual than viscerally earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Striking original imagery undercut by repetitive abstract phrasing ("crystallized sorrow," "rational veins") and schematic symbolism that telegraphs meaning rather than allowing organic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ideas-rich narrative sacrifices character depth for conceptual grandeur; elements serve a unified vision but lack the friction to make the climax feel earned rather than imposed.</comment>
