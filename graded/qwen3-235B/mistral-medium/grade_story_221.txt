<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character shows clear arc from legacy-bound to self-liberated, with motivations tied to rejecting parental influence demonstrated through symbolic actions. Lacks deeper exploration of specific past traumas shaping his psyche, and internal voice feels more atmospheric than distinctly individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear structure from entrapment to rebellion with satisfying bookending of setting. Pacing accelerates through key acts (destroying letter, firing pistol) but transitional moments like the amber's transformation feel rushed within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (rusted metal, fluttering moth-fragments) create visceral decay. Shooting gallery setting perfectly mirrors psychological entrapment and liberation. Sensory immersion slightly uneven near conclusion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Effective symbolism (amber as paralysis) and resonant ending. Emotional subtext partially undercut by occasional explicit declarations ("joyfully melancholic") rather than fully embodied action. Central conflict well-contained but theme feels somewhat surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unconventional object metaphors (amber insect mirroring human stasis). Writing style maintains tonal consistency with poetic-terse balance. Some phrases border on ornamental ("night wrapped soft") but mostly restrained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively despite high-concept density. Short form feels intentional with economical character economy. Lingering afterimage of thawing amber insect suggests depth beyond text, though not fully transformative.</comment>
