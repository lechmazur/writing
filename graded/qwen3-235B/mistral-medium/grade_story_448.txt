<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth in internal conflict exploration. "Rebelliously docile" trait shapes actions but feels underdeveloped in complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear beginning/middle/end progression. Pacing is intentional but slightly rushed during pivotal transformation sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sweat-stained walls, humming candlestick) effectively ground the supernatural elements in tangible atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids genre tropes. The brass candlestick/seashell combination offers fresh magic logic without succumbing to formulaic fantasy elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements achieves thematic resonance. Short form constraints occasionally expose conceptual shortcuts but generally serve narrative purpose.</comment>
