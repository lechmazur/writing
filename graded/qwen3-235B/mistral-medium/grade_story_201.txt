<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's whimsy and impulsiveness drive her actions, but motivation for resolving emotional inheritance lacks gradual development; internal conflicts surface abruptly without layered reasons for her quest.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to climax, but reliance on "magical realism" resolution (waterfall rhythm) borders on deus ex machina; pacing is tight yet occasionally rushed during emotional transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting blends mythic and sensory realism effectively, with the fortress and waterfall acting as active symbols; time-sensitive dusk atmosphere enhances tension but occasionally relies on generic twilight imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and kinetic prose elevate emotional stakes; theme of inheritance-as-redemption emerges organically. Some "telling" of emotional states undermines subtlety, but the metaphor of music-as-legacy resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains slightly overwrought phrases ("stones humming in approval") and occasionally inconsistent emotional beats. Shooting star motif feels AI-generated in its abstract linkage to plot resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, but the story occasionally prioritizes poetic texture over narrative cohesion; its emotional arc satisfies yet lacks groundbreaking conceptual innovation.</comment>
