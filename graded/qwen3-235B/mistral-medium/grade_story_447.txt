<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clara’s defiance is present but lacks nuanced motivation; her sacrifices feel driven more by abstract duty than specific personal stakes. The stuffed ear’s symbolic role is established but underdeveloped as a character proxy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with cause-effect from bulletins to resolutions, but pacing feels slightly rushed in reconciling multiple town fractures within word constraints. Logical gaps exist in how bulletins directly enact change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Amber prison evokes claustrophobic mood; sensory details (steam, stew scent) immerse readers. Atmosphere aligns with theme but lacks deeper integration with plot mechanics (e.g., why amber?).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (ear’s deterioration, stew as metaphor for communal healing). Ending’s quiet triumph delivers emotional impact. Over-reliance on metaphor occasionally muddies narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh concept with bulletins-as-rebellion method; avoids clichés through surreal execution. Writing style balances lyricism with precision, avoiding purple prose. Subtext (sacrificing childhood to heal society) adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive use of elements with clear thematic unity. Story leverages brevity effectively, though some plot mechanics remain under-explained. Ending invites reflection but may feel overly neat for some tastes.</comment>
