<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent alignment of Alistair's submissive demeanor and empathy with his covert actions; "earnest flippancy" voice lacks depth but adds nuance to internal conflict</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight pacing and cause-effect logic (eavesdropping → rescue) maintain coherence despite紧凑 word count; abrupt transition into workshop sabotage slightly disrupts flow</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic espionage tropes through bioluminescent fox and aristocrat-saboteur; earns subversion via unconventional tools (letter opener) and understated tone</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but predictably; brief length enhances tension; leaves lingering reflection on subversive agency rather than mere escapism</comment>
