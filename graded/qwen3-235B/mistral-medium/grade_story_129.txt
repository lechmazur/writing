<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Weak character definition; motivation lacks depth despite consistent actions. The troubadour's personality remains diffuse, with only the ring and tablecloths serving as plot devices rather than organic character extensions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Convoluted plot structure with arbitrary progression. The curse-breaking mechanics feel unearned, relying on vague metaphors rather than logical cause-effect. The arc compresses too much into limited space without adequate tension development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</question><comment>Mixed atmospheric execution. Rocket launch site offers strong visual potential but remains superficially rendered. Sensory details are present but generic, failing to fully integrate with thematic elements or character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Uneven literary impact. Striking imagery (e.g., "verses twisting like serpents") contrasts with overused phrases ("monument to failure"). The ending's thematic resonance feels underdeveloped compared to the rich symbolic potential established.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Shows traces of formulaic writing beneath poetic surface. While avoiding direct clich√©s, the generational curse trope and redemptive symbolism follow predictable emotional trajectories without sufficient nuance or subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Partially cohesive but uneven concept integration. Strong visual metaphors clash with underdeveloped thematic elements. The brief format feels more restrictive than artistically purposeful, leaving key narrative threads unresolved.</comment>
