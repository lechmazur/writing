<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth beyond archetypal "warrior-philosopher" framework. Motivation feels abstractly stated rather than dramatized through specific actions or decisions. "Patiently frantic" contradicts itself without emotional context, making reactions feel mechanical rather than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows mythic structure effectively within constraints, but causal logic (e.g., how prism refraction works) remains vague. Pacing is intense but compressed—emotional beats lose impact. Clear beginning/middle/end arc exists but resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm atmosphere is viscerally rendered through kinetic language and sensory details (humming armor, crackling lightning). Sky burial site remains underexploited as a thematic location—its connection to dead whispers feels tacked-on rather than integrated into world logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (prism/refraction imagery, armor as mirage) elevate the prose, but emotional resonance remains superficial. Ending’s thematic declaration lacks narrative support—more poetic incantation than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Aesthetic of "techno-mysticism" shows creativity but veers into purple prose (e.g., "circuits burned with conviction"). Formulaic phrases ("collision course with truth," "whispers carried away") undermine uniqueness. Emotional abstractions dominate over grounded specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story successfully synthesizes most elements into a cohesive mood piece, though technical excellence outweighs narrative innovation. Lingering power comes from striking imagery rather than philosophical depth—evocative but more atmospheric than transcendent.</comment>
