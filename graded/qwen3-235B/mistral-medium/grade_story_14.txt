<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth—more symbolic placeholder than fleshed-out protagonist. Motivation (last spark) is clear but underdeveloped; reactions are abstract rather than grounded in human nuance. Dialogue/stories of professors add contrast but leave Elias as a vessel for themes, not a full character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves cyclical structure and symbolic cohesion within word limit, but pacing feels compressed. Beginning-to-end connection exists thematically (candle’s burning as arc), but cause-effect logic (why professors see through Elias, how his debt is settled) relies on abstraction rather than narrative causality. Some rushed progression toward finale.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered: the tidal station’s industrial decay, candlelit dinners, and professors’ madness create a haunting, immersive mood. Sensory details (wax-stained molds, turbines’ hum) deepen thematic echoes of impermanence. Timeframe during dinners is underutilized but atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storytelling is evocative, using candle as metaphor for gambling, oblivion, and cycles. Literary devices (e.g., shadows twisting like bargains, tide as inevitability) are skillfully deployed. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact is tempered by abstraction. Subtext about bargains and cruelty of eternal recurrence is clear and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphors and cyclical framing; avoids clichés. Avoids "purple prose" despite lyrical style, prioritizing purposeful imagery. Character reasoning aligns with symbolic roles, though Elias’s naivete lacks psychological complexity. No formulaic phrasing; tone is consistent and stylized to suit themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements (candle mold, professors, tidal station) are tightly woven into a cohesive narrative. The brief length feels intentional, distilling themes to their essence. Style balances clarity and artistry. Leaves lingering questions about fate and cycles, though abstract nature may limit emotional reverberation for some readers.</comment>
