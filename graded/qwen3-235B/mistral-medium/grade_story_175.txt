<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and consistent motivation, but emotional depth remains elusive; actions align with traits but lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent but compressed; the ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance, and the word limit constrains emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details (mist, creaking cage), but setting integration feels occasionally superficial, especially mushroom village's underexplored role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (birdcage, crumbling sign) and layered subtext elevate the narrative; the ending lingers thematically, though some emotional beats rely on implication rather than immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors and consistent tone; the "feral elegance" trope is subverted through restraint, but some phrasing edges toward poetic excess without added depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive despite tight constraints; elements serve thematic unity, but the brevity slightly undermines full realization of the minstrel’s transformation.</comment>
