<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conceptual depth over character; motivations are implied through abstract imagery rather than concrete actions or dialogue, leaving Elias feeling more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Structure loops like the labyrinth but lacks clear momentum; the elevator's arc is metaphorical rather than plot-driven, and the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic echoes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (humming metal, static-filled memories) but fragmented; the abstract "migration pattern archive" dilutes setting cohesion despite sensory details like the elevator’s hum and worn cards.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("spaces between" geometry) resonate, but emotional impact is diffused by abstraction; the ending’s lyrical closure leans on cliché ("constellation through the dark") despite moments of originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but risks purple prose ("migration pattern archive," "drifting signals"); the labyrinth-as-self epiphany is familiar, though revitalized by the metaphor of unspoken bonds as maps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the pirate radio and archive feel imposed rather than organic, though the calling cards and elevator’s unresolved farewell integrate well; the ending’s reflective tone lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
