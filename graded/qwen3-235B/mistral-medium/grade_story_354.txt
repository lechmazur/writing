<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's ethereal nature and "daring compassion" motivation are clear but lack emotional depth or nuanced internal conflict. Motivation shapes surface actions but doesn't explore psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but occasionally prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum. Some transitions feel compressed yet maintain logical progression toward the symbolic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest aspect - vivid sensory details like "glitches like fireflies" and "code unraveling into poetry" create an immersive, hauntingly beautiful world that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (teddy bear as fragmented world, auroras as transcendence) elevates the narrative. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact could be more visceral through character-driven moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly original with minimal clich√©s. Avoids formulaic phrasing through striking metaphors ("world where logic bent but never broke"). Some poetic abstraction but maintains stylistic coherence and emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally interconnected, though some (like "cosmic disclaimers") strain plausibility. The short format works well for poetic storytelling but occasionally limits emotional payoff.</comment>
