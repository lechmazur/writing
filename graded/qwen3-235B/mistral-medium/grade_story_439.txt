<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character’s muteness is conceptually integrated but lacks emotional depth; motivations are implied through action rather than concrete development, leaving the protagonist more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses via metaphorical movement rather than causal events; the tight arc feels artificial due to reliance on abstract resolutions over structural inevitability within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vivid and thematically resonant, though the storm-battered harbor feels underexploited beyond mood; snow and opera house enhance the introspective tone through precise sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphors (comet as guidance, silence as canvas) elevate thematic cohesion; the ending’s introspective revelation feels earned but risks being overly didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the metaphorical framework, but some phrases ("dust motes dancing like lost performers") verge on cliché; subtext is layered yet occasionally undermined by ornate abstraction.</comment>
