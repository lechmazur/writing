<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sleepy trait underdeveloped; motivation to shed pride feels imposed rather than organically tied to character. Spiritual/material attribute mentioned once without narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from entering room to departure, but action progression (lifting barbells) lacks dramatic stakes. Intangible limits theme remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (storm vs. disguise room) create mood, but secret agent setting and hush timeframe feel arbitrarily juxtaposed rather than thematically fused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors about strength/humility resonate, but ending feels overly diagrammatic. Subtext present yet lacks emotional urgency; themes stated more than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on redemptive arc clich√©s; "mist-shrouded hills" and excessive abstract adjectives border on purple prose. Internal logic strained by forced connection between hiking mishap and disguise room.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Concept-heavy structure sacrifices emotional authenticity. Elements cohere thematically but feel checkerboard-arranged rather than organically linked; style overshadows substance.</comment>
