<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's irate trait manifests physically but lacks psychological depth; motivation to find waterfalls feels symbolic without concrete personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot flows linearly but compresses emotional and physical journeys into a narrow scope; pacing strains coherence at points, particularly the sudden tunnel-to-waterfall transition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but rely on interpretive leaps; the story’s brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of its ambitious concepts.</comment>
