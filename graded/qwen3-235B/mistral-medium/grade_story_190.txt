<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character psychology is inconsistently developed; motivations (mastering empathy, using butterfly as talisman) are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions. The smuggler's "meticulously impulsive" nature lacks tangible grounding in behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No coherent plot arc exists within constraints. Storm prediction emerges abruptly without causal connection to painter’s confession; narrative conclusion feels arbitrary. Pacing emphasizes abstract musing over structural progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Effort to create immersive atmosphere through synesthetic descriptions ("hummed with musical memories"), but setting remains vague. Drought imagery and emotional tension are conceptually linked but lack visceral sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterfly fragility vs. control) and thematic tension between logic/empathy have potential, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending lacks resolution or revelatory force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some vivid imagery ("colors faded but still vibrant") avoids cliché, but frequent poetic abstraction ("delirious stream of truths") suggests artificial construction. Emotional beats feel generalized rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elements appear included rather than essential. Story lacks narrative urgency or thematic clarity; brevity doesn't feel purposeful. Thematic exploration of empathy remains superficial despite symbolic scaffolding.</comment>
