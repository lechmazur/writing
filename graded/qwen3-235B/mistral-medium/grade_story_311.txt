<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited psychological depth beyond surface traits. Motivation is clear but lacks exploration of inner conflict. Actions align with stated goals but fail to reveal complex interiority or nuanced character growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from yearning to action, but logical vulnerabilities (e.g., photograph's cryptographic function) undermine narrative credibility. Pacing feels compressed but manages a complete arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually striking lunar greenhouse contrasts effectively with sterile base. Atmospheric details ("scent of green things growing") create immersive tension between biology and barrenness, though tactile/auditory elements underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (vines as rebellion, codes in photographs) elevates premise. Ending achieves thematic resonance through "whispering" synecdoche. Some phrasing ("serene anger") feels conceptually elegant but underdramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rebellious bodyguard trope given slight freshness through nonviolent escape. Some clich√©d elements ("whispers approval") and underdeveloped emotional subtext suggest algorithmic tendencies. Sensory details occasionally precise but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but lack deeper integration. Thematic ambition apparent but constrained by brevity and procedural logic gaps. Leaves conceptual impression but lacks lingering emotional residue.</comment>
