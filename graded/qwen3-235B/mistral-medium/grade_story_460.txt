<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is introspective but lacks distinct voice beyond abstract traits; motivation is abstract and inconsistent with "lethargically energetic" attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks clear cause-effect progression; closure feels artificial within word limit, relying on atmospheric drift rather than narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive sensory details immerse, but some descriptions overwhelm rather than deepen thematic connection to decay/wisdom.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism and subtext; ending invites reflection, but occasionally veers into ornate prose that dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original metaphors (feather, acid rain) contrast with familiar post-apocalyptic tropes; avoids full predictability but lacks subversive depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic interplay exists, but some elements function as adornment rather than narrative engine; poetic but uneven in impact.</comment>
