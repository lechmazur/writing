<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract vessel for themes; motivation implied through actions but lacks psychological depth or internal conflict. Assigned attribute "aggressively kind" underdeveloped beyond surface description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure connects beginning/end but feels more symbolic than narrative-driven; action of flinging whale whistle propels plot but cause-effect logic weakened by abstract progression. Pacing uneven despite concision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere masterfully rendered through salt-laden breeze, whale-song resonance, and lighthouse groaning; sensory details immerse reader in liminal space where past/present merge. Timeframe-setting link feels tangential but atmospheric unity strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance via layered symbolism (whistle as offering, silence as power); theme of cultural preservation emerges organically. Subtext-rich ending lingers but some metaphorical density risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("whale’s call a heartbeat in time with dancer’s step") avoid cliche; lyrical prose occasionally borders on purple yet maintains tonal consistency. Subverts "haunted lighthouse" trope with mythic/mythic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion more than plot mechanics; brevity feels intentional but leaves emotional investment uneven. Lingering question about tradition’s survival vs ritual’s futility elevates beyond surface narrative.</comment>
