<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivation; necromancer's meekness lacks nuance, sincerity feels stated rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conceptual progression is logical but feels condensed; the transformation occurs too abruptly without earned emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (tapestry, dew light) immerse the reader, but goblin context remains underexploited atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some overwritten descriptions disrupt flow, but metaphors (tapestry as map) introduce conceptual originality that avoids formulaic fantasy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually to support the resolution, though the brevity undermines deeper engagement with core ideas.</comment>
