<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is symbolic but lacks depth beyond metaphorical traits; motivations are implied but inconsistently fleshed out through actions which lean on abstract symbolism rather than tangible choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows an arc but relies on abstract progression; causal links between preserving voicemails and escaping are implied rather than dramatized, creating a sense of poetic motion over logical momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details immerse reader in surreal setting; the dreamless night and bioluminescent mushrooms create a cohesive, haunting atmosphere that directly amplifies emotional and thematic undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors and imagery (prism, cloak) carry thematic weight; ending resonates with symbolic clarity, though emotional resonance is occasionaly diluted by overly abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending surreal elements, but some phrasing (“static hissing like a serpent”) borders on clichéd; avoids genre tropes but occasionally over-embellishes to the detriment of clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration is cohesive and thematically rich; brevity serves the allegorical tone, leaving lingering questions without feeling constrained, though emotional impact could be sharper.</comment>
