<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "rationally mischievous" nature and motivation to unravel cosmic deception are conceptually coherent but lack emotional depth; actions reveal some nuance but remain abstract and archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves cyclical coherence (threshold to threshold) but pacing falters—dawn's approach and cosmic deception resolution feel rushed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Demonstrates editorial potential but lacks the visceral clarity needed for top-tier publishability; themes resonate intellectually but not viscerally.</comment>
