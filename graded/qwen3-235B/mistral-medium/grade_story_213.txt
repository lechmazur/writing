<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are stated but unexplored. Actions feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded, with minimal voice distinction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot has beginning, middle, and end, but the causal relationship between hair clip destruction and sunrise is illogical. Pacing is uneven; themes dominate over narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere juxtaposes sterile lab with wedding chaos effectively, but setting integration is superficial. Sensory details are evocative but inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thematic resonance (stories as seeds) is memorable, but emotional impact relies on exposition. Metaphors are unevenly developed; ending feels proclamatory rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by clich√©d tropes (e.g., "believe to make real"). Language occasionally veers into abstraction that detracts from clarity; emotional beats lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><comment>Story attempts thematic ambition but struggles with cohesion. Assigned elements are present but variably integrated; length amplifies structural weaknesses.</comment>
