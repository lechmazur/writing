<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s obsession with cosmic patterns shapes his skepticism, but his arc feels compressed; motivations are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc but relies on abrupt shifts (e.g., scholar’s lunging, vine reactions); cause-and-effect connections exist but are strained by word constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on fantastical elements without fully interrogating their implications; some phrases (e.g., “cracks of his own making”) border on familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite constraints; all elements serve the thematic focus on self-awareness, though tonal shifts could feel more deliberate.</comment>
