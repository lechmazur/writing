<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to restore balance is clear, but his emotional interiority feels abstracted, reducing him to a symbolic figure rather than a psychologically nuanced one. The attribute of being "trustworthy unique" isn't demonstrated through specific actions beyond passive observation of fate's threads.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from submerged hall to ascension, but the multiverse implications are underdeveloped. The action of mapping routes lacks narrative weight despite poetic descriptions; cause-effect between his touch and the routes' restoration feels mystical rather than earned through plotted logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Underwater decay and multiverse echoes create vivid atmosphere, but the setting's temporal and spatial mechanics remain vague. Sensory details (salt/dust taste, ledger's pulse) effectively immerse, yet the city hall's fractured time isn't fully integrated into the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "fractured time" and crumbling leaves-as-possibilities resonate thematically, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy reliance on abstract, poetic abstraction over concrete character experience. The ending's cyclical structure satisfies thematically but lacks visceral payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original use of drowned city hall and ledger-as-pact avoids genre clich√©s, though "threads of fate" and phantom hands tread familiar metaphysical territory. Some phrases verge on purple prose ("bittersweet grit") but generally maintain controlled lyricism without overwhelming the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven but occasionally prioritized over emotional clarity. The multiverse framework gives thematic cohesion, while the brevity works as a constraint rather than a strength. Lingering questions about the orchards' symbology suggest intentional depth but remain underexplored.</comment>
