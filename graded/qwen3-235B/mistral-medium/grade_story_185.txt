<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's calm is stated but not nuanced; motivation is clear but lacks depth in exploring why preservation drives him. Object use reveals determination but no psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc (setup to resolution) but feels rushed; cause-effect between decoding and halting decay is underdeveloped. Pacing misses urgency despite the high stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (fractured grace, humming equations) but leans on abstract descriptors; sensory details underutilized to ground the fantastical setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (pencil as bridge between past/future) and theme (resisting entropy), but emotional resonance is hindered by declarative declarations over subtle character nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but includes ornate phrases ("echoes of forgotten genius"); structure leans on trope-like progression (lone hero saving reality) without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative interplay; short length feels limiting rather than deliberate. Conceptual depth intrigues but ends too cleanly for lasting impact.</comment>
