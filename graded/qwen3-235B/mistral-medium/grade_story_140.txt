<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's trauma and redemption arc are present but underdeveloped; interiority relies heavily on familiar tropes rather than nuanced psychological exploration; physical interaction with the doll shows motivation but emotional progression feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure sacrifices clarity; planetarium encounter is underutilized as narrative driver; transformation feels compressed within word limit; while thematic resolution exists, plot mechanics rely on symbolic gestures over cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting delivers atmospheric tension through tactile details but lacks temporal specificity; symbolic elements (cracked mirrors, decaying props) align with character psychology but overreliance on "haunted" clich√©s dilutes visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid metaphoric interplay between physical/damaged objects and emotional states; conclusion rewards thematic consistency; emotional crescendo through symbolic release of trauma; maintains poetic precision without descending into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recycled melancholic tone in descriptions challenged by moments of genuine innovation; some metaphors (weight of past, shattered self) tread familiar ground but execution through specific imagery elevates them; emotional stakes shown more than told, albeit predictably.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements combine competently but not transcendentally; symbolic thread (doll=broken soul) sustains narrative but doesn't break boundaries; length serves poetic brevity over plot development; memorable for imagery, not structural daring.</comment>
