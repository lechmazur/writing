<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are stated but not thoroughly explored. Actions align with traits only superficially. Voice lacks distinctiveness, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a loose arc but feels rushed. Key actions drive progression, but causal logic falters during the climax. Pacing uneven but manages coherence within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting creates a surreal mood but lacks concrete sensory detail. Timeframe enhances atmosphere, but object-setting connections are inconsistent. Magic elements feel underdefined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (e.g., seashell as a soul mirror) and thematic hints about truth/time, but lacks emotional depth. Ending ties to themes but feels abrupt. Overly reliant on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts originality with surreal elements, but leans on clichés (e.g., "power of truth"). Some phrases feel formulaic. Lacks nuance in emotional beats, occasionally veering into vague, ornate language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements loosely cohere, but integration is uneven. Story feels constrained by its structure—length works for brevity but sacrifices development. Memorable imagery but inconsistent thematic focus.</comment>
