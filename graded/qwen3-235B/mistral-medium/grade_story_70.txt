<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (seeking answers) drives actions consistently; transformation from rigidity to softening feels earned through interactions with witch and symbolic elements. Some ambiguity in why the scribe specifically armed himself in "rules" remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear arc from seeking certainty to accepting hope; cause-effect between the scribe's methods (analyzing adhesive), the witch's interventions, and the bulb's transformation support coherence. Pacing avoids feeling rushed despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse/gravestones setting creates haunting yet nurturing atmosphere; sensory details (wilted roses, flickering light) and symbolic juxtapositions (life/death, science/mysticism) immerse the reader and deepen theme of buried optimism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through metaphor (bulb as fragile hope, "arms of steel") and subtext about empathy. Ending synthesizes themes effectively; dialogue sparing but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Combines arcane and historical elements (Tesla, witchcraft) in fresh ways; avoids overused tropes despite familiar themes of transformation. Language precise without excess ornamentation; emotional subtext feels humanely rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively: gravestone setting underpins existential stakes, bulb symbolizes fragile truth-seeking. Themes of hope/uncertainty linger after reading. Short form enhances focus on pivotal moment.</comment>
