<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to reveal truth through poisoning is clear but abstract, with actions/states loosely tied to "innocently guilty" trait; the rapier's symbolism reinforces her duality but psychological depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt plot is underdeveloped, with cryptic clues feeling like a forced engine; circular structure between opening/closing in museum satisfies completeness but pacing drags despite tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting's contrasting atmosphere (still museum vs. skateboarding chaos) and sensory details (almond scent, cracked hilt tactility) immerse effectively; "dusty starlight" tone permeates consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (cracked hilt/guilt duality) and circular imagery elevate impact; ending's thematic resonance about moral ambiguity transcends surface plot, though emotional stakes remain diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original in conceptual blending (poisoner as truth-seeker), with fresh metaphors; prose occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("careful poisoner traced the edge") but avoids genre clich√©s through thematic nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive through symbolic consistency but constrained elements (skateboarding, compasses) feel decorative rather than essential; style enhances theme but narrative momentum sacrifices for lyrical abstraction.</comment>
