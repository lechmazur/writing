<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character is concept-driven; motivation exists but lacks emotional complexity or psychological depth. The advisor functions more as a vehicle for philosophical ideas than a fully rounded individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Minimal narrative progression; lacks clear arc or satisfying structural momentum. Plot consists primarily of internal musings without traditional conflict or development.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>All elements present but integration varies. The poetic ambition comes through but narrative cohesion suffers. The brevity works for atmosphere but hampers dramatic development.</comment>
