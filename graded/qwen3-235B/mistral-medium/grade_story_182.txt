<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is primarily symbolic, lacking depth in personality beyond archetypal roles; motivations are implied through actions but lack emotional grounding or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot is impressionistic rather than structured, relying on poetic progression but lacking clear cause/effect in the transition from discovery to resolution; coherence exists thematically but not technically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eerie, vivid atmosphere with sensory details that immerse readers in the abandoned theater and magnetic mountain; the setting’s symbolic resonance strengthens the story’s themes.</comment>
