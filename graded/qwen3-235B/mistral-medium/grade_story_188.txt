<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear motivation to escape violence is established, but transformation feels abstract and under-earned; lacks specific memories/driving incidents that make his shift believable or distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Simple arc from contemplation to departure exists, but the assigned elements (e.g. "gather broken pieces") are superficially handled; pacing rushes resolution of internal conflict without meaningful dramatization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (smell of rain, cracked spectacles) create atmosphere, but the Japanese castle setting is generic and underutilized; "corroded rapture" tone is inconsistently linked to character's psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (seeds as rebirth) elevate the text, but themes rely on familiar redemption tropes; the ending feels calculated rather than earned, leaning on clich√©d "letter as salvation" narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Language frequently veers into purple prose ("corroded rapture," "improbable miracle"); the use of symbols feels deliberate but occasionally forced; lacks subversive twists on expected tropes despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but often lack depth; promising themes weakened by reliance on abstraction over specificity; concept merits contemplation but execution lacks lasting resonance.</comment>
