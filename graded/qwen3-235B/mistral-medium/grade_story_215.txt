<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Poor psychological depth; traits like "rattled" and "inwardly social" are stated but not demonstrated through specific behaviors or conflicts. Motivation for bridging science/supernatural feels abstract rather than rooted in personal history or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Relies on formulaic puzzle structure with underdeveloped cause-effect logic. The dance lesson timeframe creates artificial contrast rather than organic tension. Pacing prioritizes atmospheric beats over narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting lacks visceral specificity – sterile facility and dance lessons are minimally realized. The hidden room feels conceptually rich but under-described. Sensory details prioritize vague "pulses" over concrete textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("machine whirring to life," "scent of rain") partially compensate for surface-level emotional engagement. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks gut-punch impact. Subtext about futility vs. persistence is clear but not profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overuse of portentous phrases like "war between science and soul" veers into cliché. Puzzles follow adventure-game logic without subversion. The coy aggression tone fluctuates between narrative voice and character action inconsistently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration feels forced – dance lessons, psychic facility, and guarded disclosures operate in silos. The vintage postcard as central metaphor elevates coherence, but conceptual scaffolding often outweighs emotional authenticity.</comment>
