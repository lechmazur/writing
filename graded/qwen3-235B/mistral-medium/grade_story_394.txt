<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (create legacy of compassion) and trait (aimless passion) are stated but lack tangible emotional grounding; actions feel symbolic rather than psychologically coherent; inconsistent interiority undermines distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc (discovery→conflict→resolution) with tight cause-effect between elements, but the "pattern of fallen leaves" method feels mechanically plot-convenient rather than naturally integrated; pacing stumbles during abrupt transition from pedestal to legacy revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subterranean colosseum offers rich sensory potential (whispering leaves, trembling walls) but the amusement park's decay lacks thematic integration; "laughter and screams" echo contrasts well with current silence, yet the setting's history remains superficially rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paper airplane as cyclical symbol (dying/reborn) and light's legacy imagery are potent; ending achieves thematic closure by linking "dangerous knowledge" to earned legacy; emotional impact diluted by overly precise metaphors ("crumpled like a dying bird") that feel calculated rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (whispering ghosts, glowing legacy light) with insufficient subversion; phrases like "haunting reminder" and "unseen forces" verge on cliché; character reasoning prioritizes poetic abstraction over human psychology; some descriptors (e.g., "jagged edges bite") feel forcedly tactile to mask thematic vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Element integration is technically competent but uneven in meaning-making; the colosseum's legacy theme ties many pieces, yet connections between "aimless passion" and the compass-like leaves feel schematic; ending suggests depth but avoids concrete implications of earned legacy.</comment>
