<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent interiority; the missionary's struggle with faith lacks layered emotional complexity despite obsessive actions aligning with his motive. Voice remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc from doubt to transformation, but the piano's cipher mechanism and sudden epiphany strain plausibility. Pacing balances introspection with forward motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting with glass desert and monarch butterfly motifs. Sensory details crystallize the desolate beauty but under-explore tactile/spatial relationships.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (fork as fragile faith, piano as divine code) elevate the prose. The ending's thematic shift—from magic to seeking—feels earned but slightly pat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through the piano/monarch motifs, but borderlines on mystical abstraction. The existential crisis reads authentically without devolving into navel-gazing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but occasionally feel checklist-derived (especially "capriciously consistent"). The epiphany's philosophical weight resonates despite contrived mysticism.</comment>
