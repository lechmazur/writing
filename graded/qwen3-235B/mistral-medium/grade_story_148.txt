<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly without sufficient psychological depth; "eagerly unwilling" trait feels superficially applied. Actions align with assigned concept but lack organic complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but pacing is uneven; tapestry-driven plot connections strain logical flow. Ending feels rushed despite structural completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details contrast desert and alpine settings effectively, but underutilized monastery history weakens temporal depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original elements (tongs as tools of reinvention) present, but storm chaser redemption arc follows predictable patterns. Some purple prose and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved within constraints, but brevity limits thematic expansion. Conceptual framework dominates over organic storytelling at times.</comment>
