<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations lack sufficient depth despite introspective gestures; "quietness" as a trait feels inconsistently portrayed through abstract metaphors rather than concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters in execution: symbolic progression (cracked mirror â†’ mosaic) lacks narrative momentum; cyclical resolution feels conceptually satisfying but emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent thematically but sacrifices narrative specificity for poetic symbolism; constrained length amplifies both lyrical precision and structural gaps.</comment>
