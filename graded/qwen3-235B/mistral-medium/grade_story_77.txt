<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's introverted empathy is inconsistently shown; motivation to "champion the outcasts" drives the plot but lacks psychological depth. The starfish's role feels symbolic rather than integral to their behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on abrupt emotional shifts. The marionette’s reassembly lacks logical causal links in the pirates' behavior. Pacing is uneven within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered but disconnected from the plot’s mechanics. Sensory details (asteroid glow, marionette’s dust) enhance tone, but the space pirate setting isn’t leveraged to challenge or deepen the character’s journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (starfish as "mountain wisdom") and subtext ("fragile things held strength") elevate it, but emotional beats often rely on explicit statements rather than nuanced subtext or character action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing ("drowsy enthusiasm," "tapestry of shared isolation") veers toward purple prose. Some tropes (e.g., "misunderstood outcasts") are subverted, but emotional beats feel algorithmically generated rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, but the story leans on thematic declarations rather than organic development. The brevity works for the narrative’s fable-like tone, though emotional resonance feels surface-level.</comment>
