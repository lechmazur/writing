<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Core motivation (solving wife’s death) drives plot, but orchardist’s profession and vigilance lack clear connection to decoding blueprints. Tardiness trait is inconsistently applied beyond the final confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on implausible decoding method; peacock patterns feel contrived. Pacing rushes from revelation to confrontation; contrived “sirens” undercut resolution. Beginning/end lack emotional payoff despite thematic symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paper airplane facility clashes with peacock-espionage themes. “Sterile” descriptions are generic; atmosphere blends noir clichés with surreal imagery without cohesive tone. Sensory details (e.g., linoleum clicks) are sparse and dissonant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Peacock patterns and seal symbolism offer elegant metaphors for truth-hidden-in-plain-sight. Emotional undercurrents of grief are implied via objects, not fully dramatized. Ending’s poetic justice satisfies thematically but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conspiracy and peacock motifs are fresh, but “too many watches” director and sardonic glee feel recycled. Language vacillates between evocative (“truth bloomed like a peacock’s fan”) and overly ornate. Nuanced grief portrayal distinguishes from formulaic AI writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements forced into surreal alignment rather than serving organic story. Paper airplane facility and peacock decoding strain credulity. Lingering impression of tragedy-as-metaphor overpowers narrative logic, leaving thematic rather than emotional resonance.</comment>
