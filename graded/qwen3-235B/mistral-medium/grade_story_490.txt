<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but thinly developed; 'methodically random' trait lacks concrete behavioral manifestation, and emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven: rushed buildup to relic discovery vs. abrupt dissolution; cause-effect between hacking and relic's activation feels underexplored despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with salt, rust, and lavender details effectively create haunting desolation; atmosphere powerfully mirrors the protagonist's decaying obsession.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "newborn galaxy of secrets" and symbolic use of lavender create lingering resonance; ending achieves poetic closure through cosmic dissolution rather than narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Phrases like "rapturous surrender" veer toward contrived lyricism; while concept avoids overt tropes, motivation feels like a generalized "dangerous knowledge" archetype without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sufficient cohesion but lacks conceptual risk-taking; elements serve theme well but don't transcend it; emotional impact is diffuse rather than piercing.</comment>
