<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with the prince’s exile driving his quest for resolution. However, the focus is more atmospheric than psychological, leaving less room for complex interiority or nuanced emotional evolution beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from exile to self-confrontation, with the mortar’s ritual serving as the central action. Pacing is effective, but the turn of the key as a timeframe feels abstract and the ending leans more on metaphor than narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered—the snowstorm’s menace, the decaying customs office, and visceral details like the mortar’s wear complement the themes. The object-setting connection is strong, though the “unseen forces” remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through evocative imagery (e.g., the liquid darkening as memories surface) and layered symbolism. The ending’s thematic punch—loneliness as a shape to carry—avoids sentimentality. Subtext enriches the narrative without overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by focusing on psychological metaphor over plot mechanics. Prose is lyrical but purposeful, with fresh metaphors (e.g., “voice like wind through hollow bones”). The stranger’s abrupt exit risks feeling contrived but serves the story’s mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole. The self-contained format suits the allegorical tale, and the ending lingers as a meditation on exile and identity. Some assigned prompts (e.g., “unseen forces”) feel less integral than others.</comment>
