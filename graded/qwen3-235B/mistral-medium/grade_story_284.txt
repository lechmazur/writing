<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is archetypal but lacks integration of "pirate" trait; motivations hinted but underexplored through the paper plane's delayed revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows emotional arc, but the wallet-returning premise feels contrived; cause-effect between paper plane and resolution is rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere rich with honey/sight/sound details, but "beekeeper's sanctuary" lacks cohesion with pirate elements; tone inconsistently tied to timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (paper plane, anchoring) work, but dialogue feels slightly mannered; theme of emotional liberation is clear but undersubtextual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with singular images (bees as witnesses), but "untamed sincerity" veers into abstraction; emotional resonance is earned but bordering on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively in micro, but broader narrative logic gaps (pirate-sanctuary intersection) hinder total unity; brevity works for mood but not concept.</comment>
