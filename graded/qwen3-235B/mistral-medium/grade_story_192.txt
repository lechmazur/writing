<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations obscured by poetic abstraction rather than revealed through actions; emotional arc feels projected onto events rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot fractures under its own metaphorical weight; mystical resolution feels unearned within word constraints. Cause-effect between poltergeist activity and needlework lacks narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory fragments (wood scent, flickering shadows), but historical setting remains decorative rather than integral to thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</comment>Relies heavily on poetic abstraction over concrete storytelling; metaphors (stitches/time) lack narrative payoff. Ending achieves emotional resonance more through diction than earned narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive metaphor density ("technically organic wood," "digital age's hunger for connection") feels algorithmically generated. Emotional beats told rather than shown through concrete action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements collide uneasily; spiritual themes and digital age anxiety never coalesce into unified narrative vision. Stylistic flourishes overwhelm structural integrity.</comment>
