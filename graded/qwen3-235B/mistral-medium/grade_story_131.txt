<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character shows clear, meaningful arc from solitude to transformation, with internal motivations consistently realized through tactile interactions with symbolic objects. Personality shaped effectively through specific reactions to assigned elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to resolution; assigned action "loosen" pivotal to structure yet pacing occasionally uneven with some underdeveloped transitions within word constraints. Cohesive arc achieved despite brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively evoked through sensory details but gravitational anomaly feels underutilized as a surreal setting element. Garage cleaning timeframe somewhat perfunctory in integration with deeper narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact with layered symbolism (stones as emotional anchors, anomaly as transformation doorway). Ending resonates thematically with effective showing rather than telling. Memorable literary approach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh object symbolism and emotional nuance. Some phrases slightly border on poetic abstraction but overall maintains original voice without purple prose or formulaic structures. Unique perspective on transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated into cohesive narrative with all contributing to theme. Story feels deliberately concise rather than constrained, leaving lasting impression of emotional and thematic resonance from well-connected components.</comment>
