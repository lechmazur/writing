<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's nonchalant defiance and cryptic motivation are distinct but underexplored; his interactions lack emotional depth despite a magnetic presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot pulses with atmospheric momentum, but the abstract nature of "taming chaos" weakens cause/effect logic; coherence hinges on stylistic cohesion over narrative rigor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk airship's brass fittings, oil-saturated air, and flickering gaslight create a tactile, brooding atmosphere that amplifies the tension between order and madness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("ink shifting like steam") and existential subtext ("the sky is a lie") elevate the prose; the ending lingers as both resolution and haunting question.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original in synthesis of steampunk and cosmic horror, but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; avoids predictability while occasionally leaning on genre-poetic clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist elegantly, though the brevity leaves conceptual gaps; the fusion of machinery and myth feels intentional but lacks narrative payoff.</comment>
