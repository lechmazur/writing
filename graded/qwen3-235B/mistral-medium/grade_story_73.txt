<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (preservation) is clear but "whimsical" trait lacks manifestation; actions feel reverent, not whimsical, creating dissonance with assigned attribute. Focus on ritual neglects human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect (ritual execution), but brevity flattens tension/resolution arc; overlapping worlds concept introduced too late to fully shape narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details establish mystical atmosphere, but "ancient Aztec temple" lacks cultural specificity; broken fence line and overlapping worlds remain disconnected elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors and imagery elevate text; ending achieves thematic closure. Lacks deeper subtext—preservation theme stated more than explored through character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept undercut by clichéd phrases ("whispers of the past," "heartbeat of the temple"). Toned-down lyricism would strengthen impact over ornate descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive structure but feels engineered around mandatory elements. Brief length sacrifices emotional depth—ritual's stakes remain abstract despite poetic surface.</comment>
