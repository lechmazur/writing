<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's amiable trait lacks behavioral specificity; motivation to "fuse ancient lore with modern dreams" is stated but underdemonstrated. Core conflict between ghosts and "good news" establishes tension but suffers from inconsistent prioritization. Minimal dialogue prevents voice development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot pivots on solving crossword as communication with ghosts, creating circular structure. Climactic realization about the crossword as a bridge provides resolution but lacks escalation. Pacing feels compressed rather than purposefully tight. Causal links between timbers' vibrations and character actions are implied but not fully rendered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through synesthetic sensory details ("whispers of timbers," "pulse beneath feet"). Ghostly hunger and lighthouse mechanics create tangible isolation. Timeframe's "waiting room" description conflates with setting in confusing ways, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on abstract metaphor over concrete imagery (e.g., "chorus" of timbers, "pulse of the past"). Subtext about preserving history works but isn't sufficiently differentiated from surface narrative. Ending succeeds emotionally but risks sentimentality through generalities.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overuse of "doubly singular" as a descriptor suggests thematic prompting rather than organic development. Recurring wave/timber metaphors verge on clich√© through repetition rather than gaining resonance. Nuanced emotional beats (timbers' approval) contrast with explicitly stated motivations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Element integration is strongest with setting-atmosphere connections; weakest in unresolved "waiting room" timeframe concept. Metaphorical approach has depth but sacrifices narrative urgency. Some inventive combinations (crossword as historical conduit) elevate above formulaic ghost narratives.</comment>
