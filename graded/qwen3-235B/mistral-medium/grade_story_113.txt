<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks deep internal motivation exploration despite symbolic use of plush; emotional shifts are implied but underdeveloped; distinct voice is partially obscured by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is discernible but pacing between dream sequences feels compressed; cause-effect logic between songs and emotional unraveling remains underexplained; coherence maintained through recurring motifs rather than narrative mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (xenon light, metallic battlefield smells) effectively immerse; atmosphere aligns with sorrowful tone but some setting elements (tunnel's purpose) remain ambiguously functional rather than thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry, fraying time) are evocative and thematically cohesive; resolution carries emotional weight through symbolic action rather than explicit exposition; lyrical prose elevates craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in merging mechanical devices with emotional healing; some phrases veer toward ornate abstraction ("hollow air") but avoid full purple prose through consistent metaphor system; emotional nuance leans on symbolism over psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively though unevenly; brevity feels intentional but reveals structural strain; lingering resonance stems from poetic themes rather than narrative complexity.</comment>
