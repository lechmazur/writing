<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Minimal emotional depth; motivations exist conceptually but lack nuanced psychological complexity or relatable human layers. The twinâ€™s ghostly presence serves plot over character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear three-act skeleton but strained by brevity; abrupt shifts (actor vanishing, twin dissolving) disrupt narrative flow. Climax feels rushed despite strong visual payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Evocative but inconsistent imagery (crystal shadows, market/mountain contrasts) create mood, but sensory details rarely deepen character or plot stakes beyond atmospheric decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose elevates themes of duality/time, but emotional resonance relies on stated ideas rather than fully dramatized moments. Ending achieves thematic closure but risks triteness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Hybridizes genre tropes (prophecies, time travel) with poetical language but falls into AI-writing patterns: overused "flickering" entities, cryptic prophecy phrasing, and overly polished dialogue lacking organic cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration shows creativity (baseball as cyclical relic) but struggles to fully merge market/mountain, twin/time motifs. Theme of identity fusion lingers, though execution feels rushed.</comment>
