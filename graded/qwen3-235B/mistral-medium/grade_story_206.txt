<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; the vendetta drives actions but inner turmoil lacks depth. Dialogue absent, voice shaped by vengeful focus but remains one-dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by photographs and candy art, but pacing stumbles under word limits; beginning/end connection exists but feels compressed, resolution abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, decaying market atmosphere with sensory details immerses reader; rebellion scars and hidden continent lore hinted but underdeveloped. Tone contrasts effectively with thematic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in sugar art as vengeance; layered themes of betrayal and legacy resonate. Ending evokes reflection on cyclical destruction; emotional resonance undercut by rushed delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose and contrivanced twists (e.g., betrayer’s kindness) challenge believability; avoids total cliché with inventive revenge-as-art concept but slips into ornate description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements woven cohesively but unevenly weighted; rebellion timeframe feels imposed rather than integral. Memorable premise with lingering existential questions about legacy and power.</comment>
