<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation to understand the past is clear, but jadedness lacks nuance; character voice is distinct but inconsistently sustained. Actions align with desperation but lack deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows from scalpel to revelation, but transition to crystal-driven vision strains logic; pacing balances mystery and revelation but feels slightly rushed in emotional aftermath. Resolution ties to theme but hinges on unexplained sci-fi mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambiance thrives on neon, crystals, and fireworks, creating a vivid liminal space; however, the lab’s scientific purpose feels underexplored, weakening the connection between setting and character’s trauma.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery (scalpel as “fate,” crystals as memory conduits) elevates the story; subtext about rewriting identity resonates, but dialogue (“weight lifting”) relies on clichés. Ending is thematically satisfying but risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on mystical tropes; metaphors like the scalpel-brush are fresh, yet emotional beats (laughter of “sorrow and hope”) verge on predictable. Sensory details enrich atmosphere but occasionally lapse into generality (“eerily glowing” crystals).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements cohesively but unevenly; some (scalpel, lab) drive plot, while others (fireworks, “globalize”) feel tacked on. Style serves the surreal tone but occasionally lapses into abstraction. Leaves a lingering impression, albeit with gaps in internal logic.</comment>
