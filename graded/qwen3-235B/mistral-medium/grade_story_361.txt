<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but surface-level; "gentle" trait underdeveloped. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite first-person elements. Actions align with preservation theme but character complexity remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but feels compressed; archive quest drives narrative effectively. Pacing uneven in final act. Concept-thread connection to diegetic elements (dice, equations) occasionally contrived yet ultimately cohesive within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly textured (neon/oil/coffee) but inconsistent integration of setting elements (schoolhouse vs diner). Retro-futurism established through specific details but thematic connections to indigenous knowledge feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emotional impact relies on conceptual gravity more than execution. Central metaphor (guardian/core) resonates but ending's simplistic harmony undermines tension. Shows technical skill but lacks transcendent literary craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overtly formulaic prose while embracing genre conventions (lone guardian trope). Sensory details specific but occasionally strained. Combines elements inventively without fully subverting expectations; emotional nuance present but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements work collectively despite occasional dissonance between specific components (schoolhouse equations in diner setting). Tight economy within constraints; leaves thematic imprint without overwhelming force. Style enhances premise but lacks distinctive authorial signature.</comment>
