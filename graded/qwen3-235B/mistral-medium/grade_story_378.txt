<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character arc is present but thinly sketched; grumpiness as shield lacks sufficient earlier demonstration; motivations shift abruptly without layered internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but relies heavily on convenient revelations; pacing uneven with abrupt leaps (beetle transformation, monks' role); resolution feels compressed within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create vivid atmosphere; polluted orchard and carnival ghosts enhance tone; reclusive monks feel underutilized but intriguingly eerie.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (beetle, swamp decay) skillfully convey theme; ending resonates emotionally; some "showing" diluted by explanatory narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends tropes (chosen one, prophecy) with unique elements (clockwork beetle integration); avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar transformation arcs; prose occasionally over-embellished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>ELEMENTS generally cohesive; brevity occasionally strains narrative logic; creative use of water wisdom theme elevates beyond formulaic fantasy.</comment>
