<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; the transformation feels abrupt and insufficiently earned through actions or reactions to assigned elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but relies on elliptical phrasing rather than logical progression; the word limit forces compression that undermines clear cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere and sensory details create a haunting, immersive setting; the carnival's decay is vividly rendered but occasionally prioritizes mood over narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical language elevates the story, but thematic focus on "light" and "redemption" lacks sufficient subtext to transcend familiar tropes; ending feels somewhat pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on noir-esque clich√©s and overwrought metaphors; descriptions occasionally lapse into decorative abstraction that feels more stylistic than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric cohesion and poetic language partially compensate for underdeveloped character arcs and forced integration of some assigned elements.</comment>
