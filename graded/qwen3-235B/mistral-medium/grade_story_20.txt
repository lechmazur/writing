<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivations are implied through symbols (comb, arrows) but remain abstract without actionable depth beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but strained by rushed pacing—roadside attraction and celestial timeframe feel arbitrarily inserted rather than organically driving the narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (inverted waterfall, mist) but inconsistent; celestial imagery lacks integration with emotional stakes to fully immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (broken arrows, tarnished comb) and thematic focus on regret/resilience elevate the story, though emotional payoff feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on symbolic tropes (bridge, celestial motifs); language occasionally veers into poetic abstraction without earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly weighted—the bridge and comb succeed, while the roadside attraction and timeframe feel contrived to meet constraints.</comment>
