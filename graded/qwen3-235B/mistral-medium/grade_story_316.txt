<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Promises drive action but motivations lack depth; timidity becomes purpose without believable progression, undermining authenticity. Assigned traits surface but aren’t fully integrated into character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on symbolic actions without causal logic – "weaving healing" and "scoreboard decryption" feel metaphorical rather than narratively cohesive. Pacing collapses under word constraints; shifts between scenes are disjointed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but tonal dissonance – factory whistles and arcade scoreboards jar against ancient temple atmosphere. Sensory details lack grounding logic; "scattered harmony" concept manifests inconsistently in setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery often overshadows narrative clarity. Emotional resonance diluted by abstract symbolism; themes of healing feel generalized rather than embodied. Ending lacks earned catharsis despite lyrical language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on ornate metaphor ("needle darting like a hummingbird") veers into purple prose. Mechanical linkages between elements (scoreboard as healing guide) suggest formulaic connections rather than organic invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Cumbersome combination of anachronistic elements (arcade scoreboards in temples) undermines coherence. Assigned components feel stitched together rather than fused into organic narrative. Short length exposes structural fragmentations.</comment>
