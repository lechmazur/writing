<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's aimless nature contrasts with clear motivation to preserve recipes; handkerchief connection adds depth but emotional arc remains underexplored</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cryptic puzzle-solving drives plot effectively, but hopscotch-to-recipes logic feels strained; ending resolves surface narrative while larger character arc stays nebulous</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parchment-iron air, frost-glazed stone, ink-stained caretaker create visceral atmosphere; celestial alignments and thawing snowflake connect setting to thematic urgency</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of culinary anthropology and mystical symbology avoids formulaic paths; occasional purple prose ("seeds sewn in hem") and overly-wrought metaphors undermine otherwise fresh concepts</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Multiple assigned elements feel organically interwoven (archive, hopscotch, recipes) while others (snowflake melt timing) strain credulity in service of poetic resolution</comment>
