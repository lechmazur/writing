<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but underexplored; bitterness is shown more effectively than optimism or agency in decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying throughline but relies on underexplained metaphysics; cause-effect of the detour-to-resolution feels rushed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, unique atmosphere with sensory immersion, but some elements (e.g., cloud migration mechanics) lack full integration into setting logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance and theme of legacy/repair, but emotional beats occasionally veer toward tell-rather-than-show abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains slight overreliance on precise-yet-vague descriptors ("reckless precision"); tonal balance uneven in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive concept with strong central metaphor, but brevity sacrifices deeper emotional investment; ending feels slightly pat.</comment>
