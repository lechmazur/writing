<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is symbolically consistent but lacks depth in personal history/motivation beyond thematic role. Motivation to 'dethrone fear' is clear but psychologically simplistic. Dialogue voice blends into environment rather than revealing distinct psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression flows logically within surreal constraints, but the cause-effect of photographs' transformation feels abstract rather than earned. Pacing manages arc completion within brevity but relies on predetermined "metaphor delivery" rather than narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with tactile photographs and diner textures, but sensory details prioritize aesthetic density over emotional grounding. Timeframe's ambiguity weakens temporal specificity despite vivid spatial immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evokes thematic resonance through layered metaphors (Möbius strips, photograph arcs) and subtext about recontextualizing trauma. Ending avoids sentimentality but risks obscurity—emotional impact filtered through abstraction rather than visceral character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original conceit (anxiety-as-menu) avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into "poetic vagueness" that feels contrived—e.g., 'rationally absurd' dialogue verges on pretentious. Sensory details occasionally over-embellished without earning emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>ELEMENTS are seamlessly woven into narrative fabric rather than tacked on. Briefness enhances the story's thematic compression (e.g., photo metamorphosis mirrors psychological shift). Leverages constraints to amplify metaphorical impact rather than diminish it.</comment>
