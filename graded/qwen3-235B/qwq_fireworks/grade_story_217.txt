<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters’ motivations (Lila’s grief/adaptation, Mara’s intervention) are coherent but underdeveloped; their rebel identity feels vague rather than integral to their choices. Dialogue adds minimal voice distinction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on the ghost attack and taco-flare resolution, which strains logic. Pacing is uneven—exposition clashes with abrupt supernatural escalation. Completeness achieved but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rust-slicked haunted house’s “ribcage” corridors and ghostly taco ad create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details anchor the eerie tone, though the setting’s broader decay lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (knife as layered identity, tacos as shared resilience) deepen theme. Ending’s “dance with the unexpected” line is sentimental but effective. Subtext on grief and stagnation elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes by intertwining genre (haunted house) with mundane elements (tacos), but the sister’s miraculous timing and “spark wonder” dialogue feel contrived. Language avoids purple prose but leans on lyrical brevity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements (knife, adaptation theme) are tightly woven, but the cuisine subplot feels tacked on. The brief length works for urgency but undermines the sisters’ emotional complexity. Lingering theme about adaptation is clear.</comment>
