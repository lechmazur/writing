<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Contrite swordsman’s guilt and redemption arc are evident but lack depth; motivations are clear yet insufficiently nuanced to fully justify drastic behavioral shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but strains credibility in using yarn to unravel tattoos; pacing is brisk yet occasionally rushed, undermining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Floating spa’s lush, surreal imagery immerses effectively, though absurd elements (giggling tea) risk tonal dissonance rather than enhancing mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (yarn as truth) and theme of kindness vs. violence resonate, but emotional beats rely partly on exposition (“mended his own裂痕”) rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in concept (yarn therapy as espionage) is admirable, but overly ornate descriptors (“serpent-like tattoos”) and abrupt tonal shifts hint at forced invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but occasionally strain under their own ambition; tone and theme persist despite fantastical premises, though brevity leaves some arcs underexplored.</comment>
