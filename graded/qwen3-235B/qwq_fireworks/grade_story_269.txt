<question>1</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are tightly woven with the speculative elements, and internal conflict is shown through vivid imagery rather than exposition. The nostalgic tailor aspect is underdeveloped but suggested through symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surprisingly cohesive plot with tight pacing for the word constraint. The cyclical structure (beginning/end at the observation deck mirror) reinforces thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion—metallic tang of static, tactile cold of mirror, visual storm patterns—all reinforce mood and character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors create powerful subtext; ending subverts expectation of transcendence. Emotional impact is earned through concrete imagery rather than abstract declarations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evident stylistic fingerprints with specific metaphors (stitching lightning into sails) and conceptual blending of organic/machinic. Avoids clichéd emotional cues through symbolic transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity rather than checklist fulfillment. Brevity enhances urgency rather than limiting scope. Lingering resonance from philosophical questions about progress vs. preservation.</comment>
