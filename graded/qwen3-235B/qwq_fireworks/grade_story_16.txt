<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Freelancer's multiplicity lacks depth; motivations feel assigned rather than organically connected to their polyvalent roles. Internal conflict between mercenary and preservationist impulses only hinted at.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight pacing within constraints; rhythmic motif as structural spine works. However, the ring's late revelation of coordinates strains coherence with earlier plot logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Corroded vents and phosphorescent caves create visceral atmosphere. The steampunk engine room's integration with tidal rhythms achieves symbolic synergy, though "scattered harmony" tonal concept remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evoke/provoke balance uneven: atmospheric details resonate but thematic weight ("wisdom preservation vs exploitation") feels schematic. Final prose-as-bridge metaphor poignant but insufficiently earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps; rhythmic synchronization as narrative device shows ingenuity. However, freelancer's multi-role definition leans on trope rather than deep subversion; mechanical dialogue ("last good intention") occasionally formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements service cohesive machinery but lack emotional gravity. Tight concatenation of plot elements admirable, yet thematic resonance remains at surface level despite structural sophistication.</comment>
