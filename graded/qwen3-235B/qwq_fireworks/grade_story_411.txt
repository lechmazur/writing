<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Main characterâ€™s self-avoidance motivation feels abstract, underdeveloped; emotional transformation lacks visceral depth despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cyclical structure creates cohesion, but the abrupt pivot from self-realization to resumed stasis feels under-earned within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite, layered sensory details (glowing petals, starlit water) immerse readers, though some descriptions verge on ornamental without narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (fragments = truths, rust = time) and resonant ending elevate thematic weight; cyclical momentum balances introspection with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional overwrought imagery ("exultant grief") and a reliance on abstract emotional states over nuanced human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements harmonize for a haunting whole, but brevity exposes slight underdevelopment in character logic and thematic follow-through.</comment>
