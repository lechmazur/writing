<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's merchant background and "aloof passion" are underexplored; motivations are clear but psychological depth remains superficial despite symbolic use of the butter churn.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot driven effectively by object-action connection; some narrative leaps (e.g., poster portal mechanics) lack explanation but maintain momentum within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (frostbite, peeling posters), cohesive post-ecological-collapse atmosphere; holographic illusions vs skeletal machinery contrast enhances thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (butter churn as revolutionary tool) and layered theme of cyclical destruction/creation resonate; ending sparks reflection through visual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh object-concept fusion avoids genre tropes; minor purple prose ("desperate engineers scrambling"); emotional beats shown rather than stated with few exceptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically with minor contrivances; concise form serves narrative; leaves lingering questions about systemic collapse and hope.</comment>
