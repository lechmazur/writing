<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Primary motivation (finding sister) is clear and consistent, but emotional depth and psychological complexity remain underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc (theft → performance → escape) but relies on abrupt transitions (karaoke's magical mechanics); pacing uneven in places but maintains momentum despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory specificity (shifting hourglass sands, dissolving chalk lines), but the worldbuilding feels superficial in places, sacrificing deeper integration of time-worn themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (broken sharpener as unfulfilled potential) and symbolic singing work well, but emotional resonance suffers from underdeveloped subtext; ending lacks thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in the karaoke mechanic and hourglass metaphor, but sister’s disappearance trope feels familiar; language avoids purple prose but occasionally sacrifices precision for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative with memorable hooks (karaoke as plot device), though thematic focus and emotional depth are uneven; brevity works but feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
