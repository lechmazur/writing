<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While Lira's fixed state as a statue limits traditional character development, her motivation (truth-seeking) drives the narrative. The girl's emotional arc shows subtler development through actions like bringing the scroll. The use of telepathy to "hear" lies and communicate with the girl is consistent but could have deeper exploration of Lira's inner conflict between immobility and agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from silent protest to collective action, anchored by the statue's calligraphy. Pacing compresses timelines effectively, though the leap to riots feels slightly rushed. The interplay between Lira's method (writing truths) and the girl's activism creates coherent cause/effect. The cyclical ending strengthens structural completeness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (hissing brass pipes, glowing calligraphy) immerse readers in the steampunk setting. The polluted city square's "gloomy cheerfulness" mirrors Lira's tragic resolve and the hair tie's fragile hope. Atmospheric elements like steam and ink integrate with thematic concerns (truth obscured/illuminated).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (ink as crystallized grief, hair tie as connection) create layers of meaning. The ending's cyclical structure invites reflection on systemic oppression and generational resistance. Tension between permanence (stone/statues) and impermanence (ink, protests) is subtly woven. Subtext about truth's resilience elevates impact beyond surface narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures through unusual conceits (a stone telepath's ink-based communication). Concise, purposeful prose with minimal purple passage risk. Emotional resonance emerges from symbolic actions (tracing stone cheeks, fraying hair ties) rather than exposition. The interplay of cyclical time and persistent rebellion feels inventive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements serve thematic cohesion: bronze pipes and poisoned rivers critique industrial hypocrisy; calligraphy embodies truth's beauty and fragility. The condensed form enhances intentional symbolism. The central metaphor ("recognition's light seeping into cracks") lingers as a potent call for quiet resistance.</comment>
