<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to chronicle patterns is clear but lacks deep internal stakes; reactions feel reactive rather than shaped by the cranky oracle trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc (task, ritual, realization) with effective urgency from sunset constraint, but ending feels rushed and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid setting details (burning parchment, pawn shop musk) ground the atmosphere, though some sensory elements (sounds, texture) remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of cyclical deception are layered, and the subversion of the oracle's complicity elevates impact, but prose occasionally leans into overly ornate description.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original for subverting the oracle's role as outsider, but certain phrases ("spectral vines") feel slightly contrived, and emotional beats rely partly on explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements feel mostly cohesive but occasionally forced; the brief length works but sacrifices depth in the oracleâ€™s internal conflict.</comment>
