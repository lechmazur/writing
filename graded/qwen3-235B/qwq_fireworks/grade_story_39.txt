<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like restlessness and deceptiveness are mentioned but underdeveloped; motivations align with actions but lack emotional depth; sewing skills as method are effective but not fully integrated into personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent despite brevity, with clear cause-effect between visions and repairs; pacing feels rushed in climax, weakening emotional payoff of the biodome’s revival.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (recycled air, tremors, rust sky) build immersion; setting enhances survival themes but bookshop’s connection to broader biodome logic is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (light as sound, grit as metaphorical material) elevate the narrative; theme of endurance is clear but resolution feels slightly sentimental rather than deeply earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic dystopia tropes through tactile details (brass etchings, conductive thread) and hybrid genres (steampunk sci-fi); language is purposeful without excess, though a few phrases ("sculpt a new tomorrow") risk cliche.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive and thematically anchored despite constraints; length suits the core arc but limits deeper exploration of secondary characters and setting.</comment>
