<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Complex motivation and internal conflict well-established through symbolic actions and sparse but meaningful dialogue, though emotional nuance could be deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive three-act structure within constraints, with clear beginning/middle/end; transitions logically tied but slightly rushed in conceptualizing wish-engine mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral nano-scale details (carbon nanotube lattices, light-amber atmosphere) create immersive biomechanical world where plague scars inform both setting and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphor density (e.g., "forgiveness as prism", "wishes woven into alloy") with emotionally resonant thematic payoff through physical object transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visionary concepts (wish-engines, dissolution of scars into light) avoid genre clich√©s through poetic integration, though occasional descriptor overload ("sickly amber") slightly distracts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight synthesis of all elements into emotionally impactful narrative about healing fractured systems; thematic momentum compensates for minor pacing accelerations.</comment>
