<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reticent nature feels superficial—actions (conducing echoes, rigging pulleys) contradict shyness. Motivation (anti-complacency) stated rather than demonstrated through layered behavior. Technically mischievousness hinted via tunnel maps but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional payoff in climax, but causality (how knocking triggers echoes) feels under-explained. Cake motif interrupts momentum; transitions between ritual and supernatural elements strain coherence within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visually rich (glowing runes, cracked mirrors) but atmosphere prioritizes style over thematic function. Flooded setting offers physical stakes but doesn’t organically shape character decisions or echo concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (echoes as inherited voices, cake tin as baton) elevate the narrative. Ending resonates with duality of creation/destruction, but character interiority remains thin despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but relies on ‘magical object awakening space’ archetype. Some generic phrasing (“whispered secrets,” “fevered gold”) undermines originality. Emotional subtlety in tablet’s heartbeat warmth vs. stated “genuine smile” imbalance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Balances assigned elements with emotional core; the opera house itself functions as a character. Brevity amplifies mystery but leaves thematic questions underexplored. Lingering impact stems from atmosphere more than narrative.</comment>
