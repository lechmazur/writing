<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character development lacks emotional nuance; Cedric's transformation feels abrupt despite symbolic use of the scarf; motivations are implied but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but constrained by word limit; key transitions between reality and maze rely on exposition over dramatization; resolution feels rushed despite clever circularity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (burnt sugar, ghostly light) that deepen the haunting-yet-playful tone; the sentient maze enhances thematic subtext.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (scarf as emotional burden, laughter as transformative force); ending resonates thematically but slightly underdelivers on the maze's existential stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Some overwritten descriptors ("corn silk laughter") flirt with purple prose; generally avoids clich√©s but occasional phrasing feels overly ornate rather than precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates most elements but struggles to fully leverage the sentience deadline; brevity works for thematic impact but limits emotional payoff.</comment>
