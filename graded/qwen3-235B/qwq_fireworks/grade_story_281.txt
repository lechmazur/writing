<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and arc, but motivation shift from theft to transformation lacks sufficient emotional groundwork; reactions to the dummy feel reactive rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates clear arc and thematic resolution, but rapid transformation and cause-effect between poetry lines and mechanical reactions strain internal logic; pacing leans rushed in central section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (grease, rusted pipes, dummy's glass eyes) create immersive claustrophobic atmosphere; setting deeply interwoven with theme, though timeframe's role remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of paradoxical imagery ("cold silver," "scorching epiphany") and layered metaphors; ending resonates thematically, though some poetic devices verge on overwritten abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clich√©s through metaphorical approach, but AI-like tendencies emerge in overly precise descriptors ("400-500 word constraint") and occasionally mechanical dialogue cadence in dummy's lines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than average short fiction, though timeframe device and some poetic devices feel imposed rather than organic; thematic resonance outweighs minor structural imperfections.</comment>
