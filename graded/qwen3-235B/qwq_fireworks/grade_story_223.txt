<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric's guilt and cowardice are clear, but his "awkwardly charming" trait feels underexplored. His redemption through the orchid is symbolically tied to his actions, but internal motivation lacks layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight structure with the moon-phase countdown, but the resolution feels abrupt. The bulb-to-truth transaction lacks emotional buildup, and pacing stumbles under the word limit's constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Surreal, immersive setting—crystal fortress, rainbow canyon, liquid starlight—creates a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (crystallized salt, prismatic light) enhance mood, though the fortress's metaphysical rules remain underdefined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror as self-deception, orchid as healing) enrich the theme, but emotional impact is undercut by predictable redemption beats. The ending’s thematic closure feels earned, if not revelatory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality diluted by familiar tropes (haunted mirrors, guilt-to-redemption arcs). Some sensory details (e.g., "prismatic daggers") feel overly ornate. Avoids purple prose but leans on formulaic transitions during the orchid’s growth sequence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically, but the narrative prioritizes poetic imagery over emotional depth. The brief length works for atmosphere but limits character and thematic exploration.</comment>
