<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marla's fear of the dark is central but underexplored psychologically; motivations feel surface-level despite thematic alignment with her stunts and unraveling the net. Nuanced reactions to the net’s revelations are hinted but lack depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pacing feels rushed in key moments (e.g., transition to pyramid); plot arcs are conceptually clear but strained by word constraints, with cause-effect gaps (e.g., envelope’s origin) weakening cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eerie, vivid details (whispers, glowing hieroglyphs) immerse readers, but the pyramid library’s mythic tone clashes unevenly with the "mundanely spiritual" envelope, diluting atmospheric unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (net as psyche) and the triumph theme resonate emotionally, but subtext is occasionally heavy-handed; ending is poignant but slightly contrived in its neat resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but leans on familiar tropes (ancient relics, fear-conquering arcs); prose wavers between striking imagery and overly ornate phrasing that distracts from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Story hangs together, but elements like the envelope’s role feel forced; brevity elevates thematic focus but leaves arcs underdeveloped, undercutting the potential for lingering resonance.</comment>
