<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are intriguing but underdeveloped; Mara’s transition from interpreter to lawbreaker lacks emotional grounding despite compelling premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coheres within tight constraints but relies on abrupt, unearned shifts (e.g., phantom engineer’s voice); resolution feels compressed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High-concept coherence with lingering resonance; some plot contrivances undercut otherwise elegant synthesis of form and theme.</comment>
