<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fails to leverage "thin-lipped" as more than physical description; motivation of knowledge-seeking reads as surface-level despite repeated declarations. Actions driven by plot mechanics rather than psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect from fragment's power to map discovery to curse activation, but rushed ending compresses emotional payoff. Pacing strains against 500-word limit, particularly in abrupt transition from spectral ship to physical destruction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mold-iron olfactory pairing creates visceral decay; collapsing mine-as-library establishes isolation. Sensory details (cravat silk, fragment heat) anchor surrealism. Timeframe's midnight chime adds eerie specificity but underused.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("shadows like serpents") undercut by overwrought personification ("library gasped"). Theme of dangerous knowledge has potential but remains conceptual. Ending's question mark symbolizes theme superficially rather than organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Recycles occult-archaeology tropes without subversion. Fragment's "heartbeat" pulses feel recycled, though mine-library's collapse into fjord offers modest originality. Excess precision in descriptions ("glassless eyes") veers toward artificiality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</graduate><comment>Cohesive but predictable structure; all elements present yet unevenly weighted. The fragment and curse drive momentum while timeframe feels arbitrarily symbolic. Lingering question mark offers conceptual closure but thin emotional resonance.</comment>
