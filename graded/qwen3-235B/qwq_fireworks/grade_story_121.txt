<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clay’s spontaneity and parole history hint at depth but his emotional shifts feel rushed; Lila’s reconciliation lacks nuanced motivation despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from parole to reunion, but the caravans’ vanishing and abrupt ritual mechanics strain coherence; pacing is taut but occasionally cryptic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere—rotting drive-in, spectral caravans, caramel-and-decay imagery—evokes haunting melancholy; sensory details ground the surreal elements in tactile realism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (quartz as regret, silver bridge) resonate, and the ending’s subtext about fracture/unity offers reflection; some emotional beats verge on sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but skirts AI-like phrasing (“spectral glow,” “angusthed joy”); subversion of guilt-as-mineral is inventive, though emotional nuance occasionally flattens into symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively into a thematic exploration of failure/redemption; brevity feels intentional, though the circus’s role remains intriguingly ambiguous.</comment>
