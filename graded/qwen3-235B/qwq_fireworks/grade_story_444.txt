<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth in personal stakes; actions align with traits but could explore nuance in emotional conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through the chain of events and letters; cohesive arc within the word limit, but the ship's backstory resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and atmospheric decay enhance themes; setting's decay mirrors the dismantling of illusions, though secondary locations (library, lighthouse) feel underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interwoven cohesive; the brevity accentuates thematic focus, though the ending's impact could linger more strongly.</comment>
