<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but internal conflict resolution feels rushed; transformation from caution to purpose lacks gradual nuance despite impactful final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains clear arc from discovery to thematic resolution, but tight word limit causes compressed pacing during the fortress's transformation; cause-effect between rosary's symbolism and collective action remains logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Serpent-shaped fortress offers striking visual anchor and the desert atmosphere is evocative, but sensory details (sound of humming walls, texture of amber) could enhance immersion rather than merely serve symbolic purposes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in amber beads containing transient art; subtext about preservation vs. creation is effectively shown through character actions and transformed environment rather than stated; lyrical prose balances concrete imagery and abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original combination of desert archivist with ephemeral art philosophy; avoids genre tropes through specific cultural details (sand sculptures, chalk murals); metaphors avoid cliche through precise sensory grounding in fossilized scenes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements coalesce around theme of impermanence; forced brevity occasionally flattens secondary developments but deliberately serves the story's meditation on artistic ephemeralism; lingering emotional resonance emerges from paradoxical preservation of transience.</comment>
