<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's zealotry is clear but underexplored; motivation for obsession with legacy exists but lacks emotional depth, creating a psychological flatness despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure connects beginning and end but relies on abrupt revelations; pacing compresses emotional beats, making key realizations feel under-earned despite coherent cause-effect chains.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral, detailed descriptions (rusted pipes, fractal screens) create a haunting atmosphere; sensory precision (humming generators, tactile paper money) immerses readers in the lab’s liminal space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (scar as currency, attractor as legacy) resonate; ending balances resignation with thematic closure. Subtext on generational sacrifice lacks visceral emotional grounding despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on "haunted scientist" tropes; similes like "fraying edges of a collapsing system" elevate originality. Stylized prose occasionally veers into pretension without derailing narrative intimacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically but unevenly in execution; brevity serves metaphor over emotional complexity. Lingering questions about legacy’s cost feel intentional yet unresolved in character depth.</comment>
