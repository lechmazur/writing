<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations align with claustrophobia and melancholic curiosity, but emotional transformation feels slightly accelerated. Voice remains consistent, though the jam-tasting method lacks sufficient psychological nuance beyond metaphorical shorthand.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic arc from isolation to integration, but the pivotal jellyfish sting and sudden "healing touch" revelation disrupt pacing. Some cause-effect transitions feel poetic rather than logically grounded, straining coherence within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting imagery of bioluminescent kelp and floating ruins creates immersive atmosphere. The tea house's living quality enhances the mystical tone, though the "sun-warmed orchard" flashback in quince tasting risks sensory dissonance with the underwater setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (jam as emotional lexicon) resonate with quiet melancholy. The ending's thematic loop ("improbable beginnings") and healing-as-listening concept are poignant, but the final line feels slightly overwrought. Emotional beats lean on sensory descriptions rather than interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through inventive use of jam alchemy and aquatic mysticism. Some phrases ("cracking ice" laugh) verge on familiar symbolism. The claustrophobia-healing parallel shows human nuance, but character reasoning occasionally defaults to mythic simplicity over psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically cohesive whole, but the brevity necessitates glossed-over logic (e.g., jam science, jellyfish's connection to owner's voice). Lingering impact resides in its sensory poetry rather than radical structural innovation.</comment>
