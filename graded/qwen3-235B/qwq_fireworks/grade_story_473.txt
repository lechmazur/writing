<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara’s cartographic skill is mentioned but underutilized thematically; her "calculated unpredictability" is demonstrated through actions like planting saplings but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly coiled around pruning as both symbol and action, but the leap from encoded disclaimers to corporate compliance strains plausibility within the brief arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory contrasts (solar panels vs. gnarled roots) create a haunting atmosphere; setting is integral to every thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (pruning as choosing futures) are potent, but the resolution’s disclaimer feels slightly pat; the handshake ritual as "faith" elevates the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid originality in merging environmentalism with coded resistance; some phrases ("rasp honed by years") veer into cliche, and emotional beats occasionally over-explain (e.g., sleepless nights).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story transcends constraints with poetic precision in tying elements into a cohesive whole; the map-as-resistance angle could be more deeply excavated.</comment>
