<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's crisis as a labyrinth architect is central but underdeveloped; her desperation is felt but her transformation lacks grounding in actionable details. The "unspoken bonds" theme informs motivation but isn't deeply integrated into her personal history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Non-linear progression works within constraints but sacrifices clarity; cause/effect between equation fragments and maze realignment feels abrupt. The migration rhythm revelation lacks methodical scaffolding for plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere mastered through synesthetic details (radio's melodic-geometric crossover, fraying card edges mirroring psychological states). The archive setting's surreal elements overwhelm its pragmatic function for migration pattern storage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors transcend decoration, with sacred geometry reframed as sonic archaeology. The ending's existential truth lands with poetic weight through physical embodiment of math ("silence between heartbeats").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subverts labyrinth trope by making spatial principles temporal. Avoids clich√© with radio waves as epistemological tools, but "whispers in migrations" risks anthropocentrism. Prose remains crystalline despite density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into haunting unity; brevity amplifies existential questions. The convergence of math, migration, and mourning achieves conceptual alchemy that rewards rereading.</comment>
