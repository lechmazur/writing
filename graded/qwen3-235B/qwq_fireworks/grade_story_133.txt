<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve hunting methods is present but underexplored; character's jadedness manifests primarily through cynicism rather than nuanced behavior; reactions to throne and gloves show technical skill but lack emotional resonance beyond plot functionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pottery class mechanism drives plot effectively but compressed 500-word arc creates uneven pacing; throne's resolution feels abrupt despite clever lock callback; cause-effect between Elias's skills and his "understanding sacrifice" epiphany lacks sufficient psychological buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Colonial rooftops and labyrinth orchard create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere through tactile details (shattered glass gravel, cider smell); some spatial logic gaps (how rooftops connect to pottery studio); tone-enhancing elements (gloves' shifting embroidery) superbly executed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtly layered theme of earned power vs. brute force; pottery-as-hunt metaphor and literalized map-as-cushioning are memorably original; emotional understatement pays dividends ("fraying jadedness," vine-scar) allows reader interpretation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrases ("blade wrapped in silk") contrast with precise imagery; avoids major tropes through throne/glove mechanics twist but occasionally defaults to portentous exposition ("you've preserved the hunt's soul"); characterization maintains consistent voice but lacks humanizing quirks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive despite density; throne and gloves particularly organic, while "painting" timeframe and colonial setting occasionally feel decorative rather than narrative-driven; brevity serves mystery but sacrifices motivational depth; lingering thematic questions about tradition vs. evolution succeed.</comment>
