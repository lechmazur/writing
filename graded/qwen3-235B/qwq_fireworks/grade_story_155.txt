<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weakly defined motivation; welder background lacks narrative integration. "Patiently impatient" trait feels superficial, actions driven more by plot demands than organic character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot moves decisively but sacrifices coherence - sudden temporal shifts and unclear mechanical logic of button-pampering relationship create fractures in narrative flow. Ending feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Nightly pulse of neon vines vs. fractured marble creates vivid tension. Sensory mismatch - too many tactile details (sticky floors, oil slicks) but lacks auditory specificity of nightclub vs. planetarium silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors work (welding/mending timelines), ending resonates conceptually but emotional impact diluted by rapid pacing. "Liquid constellations" and screaming mirrors create powerful imagery that outlasts plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps but contains artificial elements: prophetic mirrors, overly-explaining whispers. Some phrases ("seeped into cracks") show originality while others ("trembled hands") rely on shorthand. Voice remains consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements interlock tighter than most constrained stories but with compromises - welder profession feels decorative rather than structurally essential. Mends its own narrative fractures through ending, but fragility remains.</comment>
