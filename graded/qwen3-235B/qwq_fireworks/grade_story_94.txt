<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually strong but constrained by brevity; Lila’s transformation feels compressed rather than fully earned despite her compelling backstory and symbolic use of the earrings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained through vivid conceptual shifts, but the rapid resolution of Lila’s arc and the client’s narrative lacks sufficient emotional or structural payoff within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., “fractured light of the sky reflection pool,” “labyrinth of desires”) create a haunting atmosphere that deeply intertwines with the story’s themes of entrapment and liberation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (earrings as shackles, desires as gravity) and thematic resonance elevate the story; the ending provokes reflection on freedom and self-imposed illusions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi (time travel) with emotional alchemy; some phrasing risks appearing ornate, but the core concept avoids formulaic tropes with nuanced subtext on regret and control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements (time travel, earrings, sky pool) supports a layered narrative; the ending lingers emotionally, though the brevity sacrifices some character and plot depth.</comment>
