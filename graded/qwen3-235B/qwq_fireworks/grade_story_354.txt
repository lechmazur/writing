<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (reversing curse) is clear and drives action, but depth beyond core trait is limited. Her compassion is demonstrated, but internal conflict and growth remain superficial despite magical context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc (attempt → revelation → resolution), but pacing rushes the climax. Cause-effect around ricochet and bear's mechanism lacks subtle buildup. Coherence holds but feels constrained by brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with immersive details (data streams, prismatic collapse) that enhance tone. Aurora patterns and archive's collapse create striking sensory atmosphere, though some descriptors risk overloading the prose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("threads" as salvation, bear as vault) and subtext (compassion vs. cosmic rules). Ending resonates thematically, and tension between anchoring vs. transcendence is compelling. Dialogue integrates conceptually.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise combining magic and VR, but "elegant chaos" sometimes veers into ornate abstraction (e.g., "load cycle" as cosmic metaphor). Teddy bear twist avoids cliché, but phrases like "voices older than stars" feel overfamiliar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively drive narrative despite brevity; VR archive, ricochet, and bear are integral. Conceptual linking of compassion and magic feels deliberate, though thematic payoff is slightly undercut by rushed execution.</comment>
