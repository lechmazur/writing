<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness is inconsistently portrayed; initial hesitation aligns with the trait, but decisive action at the climax undercuts established motivation. Dialogue lacks distinctive voice, and reactions to the key/dollhouse only partially reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves decisively from map room to dollhouse, but the word limit forces underdeveloped cause-effect transitions. The abandoned resolution—keeping vs. destroying the prophecy—leaves tension unresolved, though the choice maintains thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (burnt cinnamon, bleeding ink) create a haunting atmosphere. The juxtaposition of Victorian key in a tech-infused setting is novel, though the map projection room’s static-laced holograms feel underexplored as a narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., "luminous doubt" as fireflies, the spine as fiction) deepen the theme. The ending’s ambiguity provokes reflection, but the central conflict’s stakes remain abstract. Some telling ("spine was a fiction") undermines show-don’t-tell aspirations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes by subverting destructive prophecy clichés, though the "spineless warrior" leans on familiar antihero tropes. Prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("whisper in his palm"), but the key’s paradoxical "trivial yet pivotal" role and vanishing mentor add fresh angles.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nearly all assigned elements are used, but integration varies. The dollhouse and key are central; however, "forgotten trails" and "projection room" feel peripherally utilized. The story’s brevity enhances poetic ambiguity but weakens plot resolution.</comment>
