<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Therapist lacks depth, motivation is externally functional, and internal conflicts remain undeveloped. Agents serve as static symbols rather than individuals with unique motivations tied to their tics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has a beginning and end, but the mechanics of draining memories via wax lack internal logic. Pacing feels rushed, with cause-effect relationships obscured by abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere shines with tactile details (candle wax texture, corroded ports) and eerie contrasts between organic and technological. Sensory immersion elevates the setting's uncanny cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like wax coding are effective but underexploited. The ending's "promise, not a requiem" offers thematic resonance, though emotional stakes remain distant due to thin character engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echoes of ritualistic technology avoid clich√©s, and the wax-code mechanic feels inventive. Occasional purple prose ("liquid hieroglyphs") and overly abstract phrasing undercut authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements collectively create an intriguing whole, though some (secret agent context) feel perfunctory. The story's brevity enhances its elliptical mystique but diminishes payoff for deeper themes.</comment>
