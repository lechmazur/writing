<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Obscure motivations and inconsistent portrayal of "aggressively kind" traits undercut character depth. The observer's actions don't fully cohere into a meaningful persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Purposeful structure with whale/dancer interplay driving the plot, but compressed word limit creates abrupt transitions and an overly cryptic resolution that weakens emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually lush lighthouse descriptions create immersive atmosphere, though some supernatural elements (ghostly figures) feel underexplained within the story's internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic resonance about tradition, but emotional impact is diluted by overly abstract character arcs and minimal interpersonal stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original conceptual fusion of dance, maritime myth, and mysticism, though some poetic descriptions verge on "purple prose" and tonal dissonance between elements exists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Visually cohesive but emotionally distant narrative; symbolic elements create intellectual fascination more than narrative urgency or emotional resonance.</comment>
