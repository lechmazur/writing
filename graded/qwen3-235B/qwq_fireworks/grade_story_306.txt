<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motivations are hinted at but lack depth; her transformation into madness feels more conceptual than psychologically grounded. The child star backstory shapes her ambition but doesn’t fully permeate her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a ritual’s execution, but pacing is uneven. The vortex sequence crescendos well, though the ending feels abrupt, leaving emotional stakes unresolved despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The cathedral’s atmosphere is exquisitely rendered with sensory richness—burnt sugar, fractal light—but the vibration chamber’s role feels underexplored amid the ethereal details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery elevates the story; metaphors like “tombstone engravings” linger. The theme of ambition as self-annihilation resonates, though the ending’s abstraction dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original and evocative, but occasionally veers into ornate prose (“spectral hieroglyphs”). The tone avoids cliché but risks alienating clarity for the sake of aesthetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story’s ambition is clear, and its elements cohesively orbit themes of madness and fame. However, the brevity leaves arcs underdeveloped, making the ending feel more cryptic than resonant.</comment>
