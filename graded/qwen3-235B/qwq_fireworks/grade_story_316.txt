<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's timidity is evident but underdeveloped; motivations tied to childhood promise and healing are clear, but "seraphic seamstress" identity remains superficially integrated. Actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure pivots on transformative machine interaction, but pacing strains under word limit; cause/effect for hologram revelation and community gathering feel rushed despite resonant arc from closure to renewal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Greek temple arcade metaphor adds mythic weight, while sensory details (humid air, rusted keys) evoke decay. Atmosphere supports thematic melancholy but temporal blending of factory era with arcade's decay weakens historical clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (scoreboard as loom, ribbon as healing thread) deepen theme; subtext of scars-as-strength works well. Emotional impact is diluted by infrequent on-the-nose declarations ("mend what was frayed").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (arcade-scoreboard connection fresh) but strains with occasional overwrought symbolism ("sacred thread"). Tropes like childhood promise feel familiar yet reframed by tactile specificity of machinery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements fused with thematic intent (e.g. ribbon-scoreboard nexus) but uneven integration (Greek temple flourish; "overtake" contradicts gentle mending premise). Lingering impression of unresolved tension between personal vs communal healing.</comment>
