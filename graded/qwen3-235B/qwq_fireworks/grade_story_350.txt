<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysandra's skill as a puppeteer is tied to her precision but feels underutilized thematically; her reaction to the gown reveals backstory, but emotional depth lacks nuance in such a brief format.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from puzzle-solving to revelation, but the abrupt statue niche and "lyre symphony" climax strain credibility; structure is cohesive but pacing feels rushed in key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Temple's decaying grandeur and sensory details (dust, lyre's resonance) create haunting intimacy; the setting deepens the mystery but historical specificity remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (stamps bleeding ink, tears as coordinates) elevate the narrative; the emotional impact of the tragic reveal is potent, though some poetic phrasing risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with unique stamp/gown interplay; prose balances lyricism and clarity but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("symphonies of truth" lacks concrete grounding).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements feel interconnected through the theme of fragmented truth; concise length works for mystery but sacrifices deeper character exploration.</comment>
