<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve languages is clear but his inner conflict between past/family and mission lacks deeper exploration. Emotional reactions often remain surface-level, with sister's memory feeling underdeveloped despite symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot driven by dares and diversion, but pacing feels rushed in key moments (e.g., Marcus's confrontation). The beginning/end connection via the gift tag works, but cause/effect around Marcus's motives and system vulnerabilities remain underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent biodome and stretching mechanics create vivid atmosphere, though sensory details often lean generic (e.g., "whispering leaves"). The connection between genetically altered crops and linguistic extinction is conceptually strong but underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Uses layered metaphors (languages as ghosts, vines as memory) effectively, but emotional impact is diluted by explicit exposition. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks the visceral punch implied by "ghostly resolve" tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific cultural references (Nahuatl, Tupi) and restrained prose. The rivalry trope and hologram message feel slightly formulaic, but the fusion of linguistic archival with biotech setting demonstrates inventive thinking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but with inconsistent execution (e.g., "impatient patience" feels stated rather than dramatized). The short form works for urgency but sacrifices deeper exploration of moral dilemmas raised by the ending.</comment>
