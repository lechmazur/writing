<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character has poetic voice and purpose but motivations (non-violence, confronting history) lack gradual development or emotional nuance. Internal logic of her connection to plants remains abstract despite symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on convenient confessions and mystical elements. Cause/effect between drunken historian and engineer feels contrived. Resolution feels abrupt rather than earned despite tight word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gothic atmosphere brilliantly rendered through tactile details (sticky sap, pulsing petals). Timeframe between subway stops creates eerie temporal liminality. "Empty abundance" remains underexplored thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory metaphors elevate narrative; poems as revolutionary tools add subtext. Ending ties together plot but thematic depth (listening vs silence) feels simplified. Conflict against systemic violence resolved too neatly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through botanical symbolism but relies on familiar "city's buried secrets" framework. Language occasionally ventures into poetic abstraction but maintains distinct voice. Subversion of revolutionary narrative through passivity feels conceptually fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into haunting whole but structural seams showâ€”party confession feels forced, engineer's transformation underdeveloped. Ending lingers with its meditation on listening, but execution occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative precision.</comment>
