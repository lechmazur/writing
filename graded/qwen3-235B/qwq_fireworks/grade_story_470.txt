<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's practicality and 'precisely imperfect' trait are clear but lack deeper exploration of how these uniquely shape her identity beyond surface-level plot actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly woven around the screw and diary, but the transition from problem-solving to guardian quest feels slightly rushed despite clear cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid steampunk imagery (carnival lights, groaning engines, whalebone keys) creates an immersive atmosphere, though the street fair’s integration with the submarine setting lacks some cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids egregious clichés by blending steampunk with bardic lore, but some elements (hidden diary, guardian trope) feel familiar despite clever contextual twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a compressed narrative with a clear arc, though its brevity limits deeper exploration of the guardian mythos and character complexities.</comment>
