<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (exposing deception) is clear but thinly contextualized; the cook's profession adds intrigue without deeper thematic rooting; reactions to objects feel driven by plot needs over organic psychology; voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person-like narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot tightly structured within constraints: discovery of notches → ledger’s erased entries → subversion of facility’s systems. Assigned elements (notches, eraser, subvert) drive progression. Some leaps (e.g., immediate control room access) strain verisimilitude, but momentum sustains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decayed technology and historical erasure is visceral: rusted machinery, "centuries of dust," smudged ink create claustrophobic urgency. Sensory details (scratching eraser, trembling hands) mirror psychological tension. Setting as character—decaying facility embodies institutional lies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evokes awe/unease via lyrical precision ("dust motes swirled like suspended earthquakes"). Metaphors (eraser as "weapon," notches as tombstones) resonate. Ending avoids melodrama, implying truth’s survival through loss. Ambiguous yet resonant subtext: power of hidden histories. "Telling" is minimal but occasionally present (e.g., "root of all lies").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through hyper-specific imagery ("18th-century ledger nibbled by time," "red screen’s illusion crumbled"). Some phrases ("frantic search dissolving into calm") risk abstraction, but overall style feels human—unpredictable, with emotional resonance in material details (e.g., cracked eraser revealing erased ink).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements (cook, eraser, notches, facility) inseparable from narrative logic—each propels revelation. Tone ("frenzied tranquility") and concept ("impossibly conceivable") deepen thematic tension between control and chaos. Concise format feels intentional, leaving echoes of erased lives and institutional complicity.</comment>
