<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation for healing traditions is clear but underexplored; "gracefully awkward" trait appears superficially without deep character integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot advances through coded letter discoveries but feels rushed in its emotional payoff; cause-and-effect connections exist but lack resonance due to compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid juxtaposition of ossuary decay and gourmet opulence works well; inconsistent sensory details (e.g., taste descriptions) prevent full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (bones as memory, food as healing) show promise but execute thematically. Ending lacks satisfying closure while attempting philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by familiar arcs (choosing healing over violence) and occasional ornate phrasing that distracts from narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist but strain cohesion; brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional. Subtextual layering exists but remains underdeveloped.</comment>
