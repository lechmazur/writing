<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (guilt, atonement) is clear but occasionally veers into melodrama; reincarnation element feels underexplored as a thematic device beyond surface-level penance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is efficient and cohesive within constraints, but the storm’s role as catalyst lacks deeper integration; pivotal moments feel slightly rushed despite solid narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Absorbing, atmospheric details (mold, creaks, rusted key) masterfully amplify decay and stagnation; setting’s sensory richness directly supports themes and mood without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (toy soldier, rainwater) elevates subtext; ending resonates as both resolution and quiet rebellion; emotional impact is genuine but occasionally undercut by occasionally labored metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with inventive premise (reincarnated goldfish caretaker), but some phrases ("hum in her bones") border on purple prose; tonal consistency strengthens over time but has uneven patches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere tightly around guilt/redemption theme; tightrope between lyrical prose and narrative efficiency mostly succeeds, though word count occasionally limits emotional payoff of secondary motifs.</comment>
