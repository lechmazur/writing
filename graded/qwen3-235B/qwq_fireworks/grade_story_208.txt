<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (undoing regrets) are consistent and tied to his identity as a musician, but interiority feels slightly underdeveloped despite symbolic gestures. The pen’s interaction reveals his guilt but lacks raw human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot driven effectively by the "rewind" mechanism, though minor abruptness in time-loop transitions. Resolution connects cohesively to opening imagery, balancing tight pacing with emotional payoff. Causality in regret-backlash mechanic remains clear.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting’s sterile machinery contrasts nicely with nostalgic pen/suitcase motifs, but atmospherics lean heavily on visual descriptors—more olfactory/tactile details could deepen immersion in the facility’s liminal space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance via metaphors (pen as a mirror, suitcase as life). Lyrical prose avoids melodrama while exploring grief. Ending’s theme—"regrets as retuned stories"—is both poignant and intellectually satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing; the "laughter in cosmic absurdity" twist feels fresh. Sensory details lean specific without decadence. Subtextual layers (guilt vs. forgiveness) emerge organically. Occasional phrase ("liquid memory") risks abstraction but mostly works.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive synergy between elements: postal facility thematically links to lost communication, pen enables psychological stakes, and rewind mechanic shapes both plot and character arc. Tight economy in brief format.</comment>
