<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Feral traits surface primarily in Kael’s untamed freedom but lack visceral physicality; her preservation motivation ties to the bookmark but feels underexplored in emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (attempting the dirge, pivotal leaf sound, post-procedure reflection) but the vanishing stars’ consequence feels underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dreamlike sensory details (ink’s liquid amber, starless ache) create an immersive mood; the factory’s connection to musical entropy is evocative but could lean harder into its surreal mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as vanishing stars, music as rebirth) add depth; the ending’s thematic echo (“save” vs. “reborn”) lingers effectively despite minimal emotional exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original premise avoids tropes; lush descriptions occasionally border on ornate but generally serve atmosphere over self-indulgence. The paradox of preservation through reinvention feels humanly nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole but sacrifice some character depth for conceptual scope. The brevity amplifies poetic resonance without feeling cramped.</comment>
