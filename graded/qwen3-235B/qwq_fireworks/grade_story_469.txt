<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inconsistent character depth; motivations are partially obscured by stylized prose, though the logically emotional trait is occasionally demonstrated through split-second decisions. The skeleton key feels more symbolic than integrally tied to her personality beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive plot structure with urgent pacing, but the final countdown’s stakes remain abstract. Cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., overreaching for the shadow) feel purposeful, though the abrupt ending sacrifices emotional payoff for thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (jasmine, whispers, marble) masterfully create an eerie, mythic atmosphere. The garden scent as a "compass" ties setting to theme, though the whispering gallery’s lore feels underexplored despite its atmospheric density.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with effective metaphors (e.g., skeleton key as a "metronome"), but emotional resonance is undercut by overreliance on poetic abstraction. Subtext (sacrifice vs. survival) emerges clearly, though the ending feels thematically pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with unique imagery (constellation-etched tunnels), but the "logically emotional" trait feels surface-level. Character voice occasionally veers into melodrama ("grandiose modesty"), and some phrases ("thrashing heart") lack originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive yet uneven; assigned elements are well-integrated (key, countdown), but deeper interplay between logic/emotion and survival feels underdeveloped. The bittersweet ending lingers, though the story’s brevity prioritizes style over thematic complexity.</comment>
