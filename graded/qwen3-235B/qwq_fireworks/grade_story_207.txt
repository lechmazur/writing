<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (oath-breaking/redemption) is clear and drives action, but "meekly assertive" trait feels occasionally forced. The bouquet as a symbolic object effectively reveals her history but could use more internal conflict depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dividing the bouquet propels the plot effectively, with satisfying cause-effect connections. However, the compressed word count makes the airlock scattering section feel abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned medical bay excels with vivid rust/antiseptic sensory details and holographic decay. The skeletal scanners' jagged shadows and haunting cosmic hum create an oppressive yet sacred atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (bouquet=divided souls) and cyclical narrative (entrance/exit) create resonance. Subtext about redemption as process rather than endpoint lingers, though emotional transitions could be smoother.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but features one-overused "universe hums" metaphor. Peddler's voice maintains consistency, though some phrases like "meekness hardening into quiet strength" border on writerly abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but strained by gossip columns as an implausible information source in a space station. The redemptive arc and cosmic symbolism provide thematic unity despite structural constraints.</comment>
