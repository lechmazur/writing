<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation to restore systems is clear but underexplored; her creative actions align with traits but lack deeper personal stakes or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression from conflict to renewal is logical, but pacing strains coherence; some beats (keeper's shift) feel abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ethereal setting enhanced by sensory details (shimmering gravel, trembling leaves) creates immersive phantasmal atmosphere, though tech-organic fusion could be richer.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (chaos/renewal) and cyclical theme resonate; ending's lyrical closure elevates impact, though emotional depth remains restrained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but edges toward poetic abstraction; fresh use of "sound as repair" contrasts with occasionally florid descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate well (e.g., leaves as both plot device and symbol), but brevity limits thematic expansion; premise's potential exceeds execution.</comment>
