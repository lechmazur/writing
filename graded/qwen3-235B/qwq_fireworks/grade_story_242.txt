<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly without sufficient psychological depth, undermining consistent voice. Assigned traits (bridge between cultures) are conceptually clear but under-realized in behavior or internal conflict. Loyalty shifts feel reactive rather than earned through embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The revolution plot device drives the arc but resolution feels compressed. The "tailing strangers" method initiates change but lacks visceral stakes. Beginning/end connect thematically but pivotal stranger interaction lacks tension development within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting thrums with tactile specificity: neon flicker, sage smoke, CRT static. Timeframe ("after last truth") merges with atmospheric decay. Herbs in the booth create symbolic continuity. The vault's artifacts actively shape mood and cultural weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Static-as-connection metaphor carries subtext of fragmented communication. Ending's "whispering embers" image invites reflection on preservation. Story transcends plot through sensory "showing"â€”note the refugees' softened faces becoming "stories" rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ("fractured present," "mirthful solemnity") border on abstract vagueness. The loyalties trope is subverted by refugee twist, but sage bundle "gift" risks mystical trope repetition. Emotional nuance emerges through object focus rather than default sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story's tight thematic web (preservation/erasure/connection) elevates constrained structure. Elements like "rarely frequent" booth aren't fully exploited, but vault-as-crossroads concept creates resonant closure. Lingering question about who "Lila" truly serves sustains post-reading.</comment>
