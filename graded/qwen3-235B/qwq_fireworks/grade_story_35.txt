<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Quiet gardener's motivation to understand emotional language is established but lacks deeper exploration of her personal stakes. Her use of seeds and purse aligns with motivation, but internal conflicts remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows logical arc but feels compressed. Flicker-driven conflict and planting solution emerge abruptly. Pacing struggles with condensing backstory (retreat, purse significance) into tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between sterile tech center and organic garden amplify atmosphere. Bird calls and flickering lights create immersive, symbolic tension. The purse's tactile details strengthen setting-character connections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (emotions as plants, silence as bridge) resonate. Subtext about ineffability of human experience elevates narrative. Ending evokes lingering contemplation of emotional versus technological understanding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subverts sci-fi tropes with organic solutions. Avoids clich√© explanations for tech malfunction. Embroidery memory shifts and berry-dyed threads feel fresh. Emotional resonance emerges through nuanced reactions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Meticulously constructed yet slightly uneven integration of elements. Premise constraints feel deliberate rather than restrictive. Lingers in mind as a parable about human connection's primacy over quantification.</comment>
