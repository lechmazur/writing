<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Complex motives (betrayal, debt) are clear but emotional shifts feel abrupt; the protagonist’s choice to reject revenge lacks sufficient psychological grounding despite vivid history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Compact structure works, but decoding Morse code → weaponized butterflies plot feels rushed; ending’s thematic choice (mercy vs war) resonates despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk elements (submarine, monocle) evoke atmosphere, but "battered marvel" tone inconsistently applied; sensory details (hissing spores, smoldered ribs) immersive but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong theme (mercy as justice) and imagery (glowing spores, ink as weapon); ending’s subtext elevates it, though emotional impact isn’t fully earned by prior character tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh concepts (infecting butterflies via Morse code) subvert tropes, but phrases like “fairness wasn’t justice” verge on abstract moralizing; atmosphere occasionally prioritizes poetry over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Engaging premise and thematic ambition shine, but emotional stakes feel underexplored; constrained form serves the plot but limits character depth.</comment>
