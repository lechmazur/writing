<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation for "interconnectedness" drives plot mechanically rather than organically. Internal conflict remains abstract, not humanized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but strained by word limit; cause-effect between repairs and visions feels underdeveloped. Pacing uneven—sudden shifts between action and revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully constructed through multisensory details. The "museum of lost crafts" setting vividly reinforces vanishing arts theme and haunting tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (pitcher as memory vessel) and resonant ending. Subtext on art's legacy works well, though some abstract passages dilute emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with hydromancy concept, but "pendulum rhythm" feels formulaic. Language occasionally overwrought but generally purposeful. Emotions shown more often than told, with mixed success.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements skillfully interwoven but not flawless. Tight word limit weakens character development. Leaves thematic questions but lacks emotional punch to sustain reflection long-term.</comment>
