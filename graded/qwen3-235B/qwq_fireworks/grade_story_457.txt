<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character is concept-driven but lacks nuanced interiority; motivations inferred rather than revealed through actions; voice remains diffuse despite poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arc compressed but coherent; duality-as-motif effectively bridges beginning/end; pacing occasionally favors lyricism over narrative urgency in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory fusion of celestial spectacle and grungy urban detritus creates haunting atmosphere; timelessness of nebulae contrasts with the decaying materiality of donated coats and subway graffiti.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphysical themes resonate through precise symbolism (zipper as fracture of conformity, delayed light as narrative lie); ending avoids didacticism while reinforcing central paradoxes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids algorithmic repetition; language inventive but occasionally skirts abstraction ("walls built from what people refused to name" feels overly generalized); emotional undercurrents implied rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically into mythopoeic structure; compression strengthens thematic thrust; leaves lingering questions about collective meaning-making rather than neat resolution.</comment>
