<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are abstract but consistent; mechanical intuition drives actions yet lacks depth in connecting Eli’s trapper identity to his choices. Emotional cues rely on symbolic gestures over nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on deciphering equations, but the tight word limit forces compressed pacing. The bulldozer threat creates urgency, though the connection between Eli’s actions and the broader stakes feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., frost, neon flicker) and the retro-futuristic diner’s atmosphere evoke mood effectively. Timeframe and setting synergize, but the “brink of change” could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The metaphor of equations as ancestral knowledge adds thematic depth. Ending resonates as a quiet defiance, though emotional impact is muted by abstract character portrayal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Blends retro-tech and indigenous knowledge subvertingly, but the “hearth” metaphor leans on familiar imagery. Dialogue absent; avoids overt clichés but occasionally drifts toward poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story coheres around salvaging heritage, though some elements (e.g., trapper identity) feel ancillary. Style elevates the narrative, leaving a reflective, lingering impression within the constrained structure.</comment>
