<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ties to mapping hidden energy, consistent with death wish, but internal conflict lacks nuanced exploration. Voice remains detached, obscuring deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from crisis to resolution, but psychic element disrupts pacing. Ice collapse and character transformation resolve coherently, though transitions feel rushed in key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cold air, roaring waterfall) immerse readers. Subterranean setting heightens tension. Hidden society’s dogma shapes plot but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (bookmark as conduit, ice as fragile order). Ending resonates thematically but emotional payoff is muted. Story avoids cliché but relies slightly on "sacrificial protagonist" trope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh combination of psychic calls and mystical mapping avoids formulaic storytelling. Language remains purposeful, though some phrases (“strange compulsion”) border on abstraction. Subtext about hidden knowledge elevates originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but unevenly integrated. Talk-radio psychic feels forced. Ending lingers but could deepen thematic resonance. Writing style excels, though structure occasionally strains under ambitious concepts.</comment>
