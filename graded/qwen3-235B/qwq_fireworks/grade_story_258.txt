<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (preserving dances) is clear but underexplored; her profession as a locksmith feels underutilized narratively despite physical/metaphysical contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot cohesion exists but pacing stumbles; key discoveries (map/yearbook) resolved too neatly, undercutting tension from storm's threat.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is lushly immersive with vivid sensory details; driftwood/orchard's paradoxical fragility/resilience mirrors thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes elevate mood, but theme (loss/reclamation) relies overly on explicit metaphors rather than subtextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Evocative premises (floating orchard) undercut by generic tropes (jaded elders) and occasional overwritten passages about "storm's fury."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution feels compressed; thematic threads (cultural erasure, ritual) require deeper engagement.</comment>
