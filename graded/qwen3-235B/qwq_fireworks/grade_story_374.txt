<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Characters’ motivations rooted in inherited rivalry are clear, but their internal complexities (e.g., minstrel’s solitude, Kael’s vulnerability) could be more nuanced. Dialogue reveals conflict but occasionally veers into exposition rather than organic tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot’s compact structure works well: feud’s resolution through stamp alignment is clever, with rising tension over eviction. Pacing is tight but logical, though the storm’s “geometric precision” feels abrupt rather than organic to the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts (neon spires vs. stables, coffee lines vs. cosmos) build immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (steam, hooves) anchor place, but deeper integration of “coffee lines” as symbolic of mundane life could enhance tension between practicality and wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (stamps as inherited legacy) and subtext (rivalry as bridge). The ending’s thematic clarity (“language of compromise”) is moving, though slightly didactic. Dialogue sharp, subtle shifts in Kael’s tremor and minstrel’s hesitation enrich tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh twist on inherited feuds subverts cliché, avoiding sentimental resolution for quiet revelation. Avoids purple prose, though phrases like “cosmos spoke in compromise” lean toward abstract idealism. Emotional beats shown through actions (stamp trembling, telescope use) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock tightly: stamps drive plot and theme, setting mirrors duality, cloud-tracking method ties to ancestral conflict. The story’s brevity feels purposeful, with resonant closure. Slight predictability in rivals uniting undercut by original premise and restrained execution.</comment>
