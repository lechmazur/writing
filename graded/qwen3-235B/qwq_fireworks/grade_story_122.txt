<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivation hinted at but lacks depth. Actions align with "collision course with reality" but internal conflicts feel underdeveloped. The cyber-templar's dual nature as technological and spiritual entity only partially realized through fragmented resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing inconsistent: storm confrontation rushed despite vivid imagery. Refraction method feels logically connected yet under-explained. Ending's cyclical nature clever but resolution lacks thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory alchemy - ozone-bone scent, humming bridle, fractal lightning. Sky burial setting enhances all elements, especially mirage concept, though ancient stones' awakening remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (prism as safety illusion, lightning as defiance) resonate. Ending's paradox elevates theme but relies on overused storm-as-conflict trope. Emotional impact present but diluted by formalistic prose; cyclical conclusion conceptually strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by cyberpunk spiritualist clich√©s. Some fresh combinations (vulture-spirits, bone wings), but character reasoning occasionally reduces to "defiance = good" simplistic AI logic. Fractured resolve motif effective; "skeleton steed" risks trope territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrated but occasionally contrived. Prism/refraction concept central yet underexplored scientifically/mythologically. Poetic descriptions enhance but don't fully compensate for thematic thinness. Lingering "elegant postcard" quality over profound resonance.</comment>
