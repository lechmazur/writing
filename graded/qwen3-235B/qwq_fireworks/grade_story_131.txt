<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness feels underdeveloped despite orphaned backstory; motivation driven more by maternal connection than core trait, though emotional arc resonates through tactile engagement with objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to resolution but relies heavily on contrivance (stones aligning gravity); cause-effect connection between cleaning and anomaly-fixing lacks visceral clarity at key transitional moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (tilted roof, humming stones) create palpable unease; gravitational anomaly's physical manifestations effectively mirror emotional dislocation but require suspension of disbelief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (stones as earth's scars, deflated basketball) elevates narrative; ending's thematic weight exceeds technical polish through juxtaposition of cosmic scale with mundane clean-up.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through geological metaphor and emotionally reserved prose; metaphors resist abstraction, anchoring speculative elements in tactile authenticity with minimal conceptual overlap.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight cohesion despite multiple elements; brevity serves existential metaphor rather than limiting it; resolution feels earned through repeated stone-related motifs rather than algorithmic endpoint.</comment>
