<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's theoretical creativity shapes his use of frost/leaves; motivation to correct regret drives actions. Sister's loss feels visceral but backstory lacks depth. Distinct poetic voice maintains cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Laser-focused plot with clear beginning (regret), middle (library ritual), end (rewritten memory). Frost augmentation drives logical cause-effect chain. Pacing precise, concepts condensed cohesively into 500 words.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Waterfall library creates tangible liminality - mist/crystallization blend physical/spiritual. Frost's fractals mirror regret's recursive nature. Algae librarian and whispering books add mythic texture. Sensory fusion transcendent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (regret as crystal, time as thread). Rewriting endings through fireworks becomes existential metaphor. Ending evokes quantum grief theory - memory as living/non-linear. Show-don't-tell masterclass in temporal mechanics as emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Virtually no clich√©s - waterfall libraries subverted through algae decay. Frost equations avoid over-explanation. Emotional nuance in static constellations/fireworks-as-telephones. Language precise yet lyrical without purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Beyond elemental checklists, story interrogates art-as-atonement. Thematic unity between form (fractal patterns) and content (recursive regret). Leaves-to-ash cycle suggests impermanence deeper than plot mechanics. Hauntingly resonant.</comment>
