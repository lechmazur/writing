<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within constraints, but pivotal moments (shard discovery, transformation) feel compressed; escalator symbolism ties structure together.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone, neon flicker) establish atmosphere, but cyberpunk tropes feel derivative; setting supports theme but lacks distinctive specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Contains fresh concepts (illusions as collective hope) but leans on genre clich√©s (neon decay, renegade inventor); avoids purple prose but inconsistent originality in metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but feel checklist-driven at times; brevity works for momentum but limits thematic exploration and character complexity.</comment>
