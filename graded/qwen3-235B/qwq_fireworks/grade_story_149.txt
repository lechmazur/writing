<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weakly defined core motivations; exchanges feel contrived. Prophet's actions lack emotional weight, rebels motivation shifts without inner conflict. Dialogue exposition heavy. Distinct voices present but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive three-act structure within constraints. Laundromat to study to parking lot provides clear arc. Some forced cause-effect (door opens to impossible space). Pacing balanced but transitions between realism/magic leave logical gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually striking contrasts (sickly fluorescents vs stained glass). Sensory immersion strong but connection between mundane setting and metaphysical space underdeveloped. Atmospheric elements like amber light enhance tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (decay holding light) and symbolic resonance. Undermined by heavy-handed dialogue. Theme of unity through separation emerges clearly but lacks multidimensional exploration. Ending's emotional payoff strong despite didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of banal laundromat setting with poetic magic. Avoids cliche through specific details (liquid gold flower, *Between Scenes* shelf). Minimal purple prose, some predictable phrasing ("forgotten promise"). Nuanced emotional texture beneath conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrated with narrative purpose. Timeframe/setting occasionally feel decorative rather than transformational. Technical execution polished; invites reflection on perception and hidden connections.</comment>
