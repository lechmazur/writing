<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Skittishness manifested through tactile focus on shoes and loom, but minimal interior voice; motivation clear yet psychological complexity remains underexplored despite symbolic integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lean arc from restless entry to epiphany holds coherence, but pivotal weaving process lacks procedural stakes; resolution feels earned yet compressed, sacrificing deeper tension development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lunar colony’s anachronistic barbershop effectively juxtaposes tech and tradition; sensory details precise but sparse, leaving atmospheric potential untapped despite fertile imagery like "chrome fixtures glinting under dim light."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Loom-as-mind metaphor elegantly unifies theme, but emotional resonance stays abstract; ending’s clarity lacks visceral impact, leaning on intellectual elegance over felt revelation despite poetic "collided refinement and grit."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps through singular metaphoric systems; risks veering into pretension (e.g., "subconscious isn’t a labyrinth but a loom") are tempered by grit in ballet shoes’ stains and hum of functional machinery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved but not transcendent; assigned elements like loom/method are deftly integrated, yet lunar colony’s psychological weight lags behind its atmospheric potential.</comment>
