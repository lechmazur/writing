<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but lacks emotional depth beyond symbolic duality of reason vs. feeling; motivations are clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc, but pacing feels rushed in establishing the idol's threat and overcoming it; snowflake method feels tenuously logical within the narrative framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with haunting sensory details (frost, bioluminescence) that enhance tone and theme, though the ice floes' instability could be more tightly tied to plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolism (e.g., snowflake patterns as cosmic language) elevate impact, but the central theme of "rationally organic hope" feels underdeveloped rather than fully resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise with poetic flourishes, but the astronomer's internal conflict relies on familiar binaries; some lush descriptions border on ornamental rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story coheres despite dense elements, though brevity leaves emotional themes unresolved; the interplay of grief and logic suggests depth not fully excavated in the constrained scope.</comment>
