<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation aligns with his actions, though the librarian's shift lacks depth. Character dynamics are compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc but abrupt transitions between conflict and resolution. Pacing mostly effective but strained by word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and cohesive setting; frost/warmth contrast enhances mood. Minor elements underexplored (e.g., Children’s Wing).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (dentures as legacy) and thematic resonance. Ending satisfying but emotional beats occasionally overtold.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh core concept undercut by predictable tropes (redemptive librarian) and occasional clichéd phrases.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Creative use of elements with lingering thematic questions, though pacing and character depth uneven.</comment>
