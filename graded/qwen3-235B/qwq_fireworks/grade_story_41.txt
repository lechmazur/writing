<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's academic wildness inconsistently demonstrated; cosmic gifts shown through sparks but not integrated into personality. Motivation for breaking free is clear but underexplored psychologically. Assigned traits shape actions superficially; deeper internal conflict needed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ritual action drives plot effectively but final leap's cosmic consequences feel abrupt. Pacing compressed yet coherent; symbolic elements tie beginning/end well. Cause-effect for brooch's activation lacks full explanation. Word limit creates slight friction in emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Factory heat vs. abyssal void creates visceral contrast. Gargoyle eyes glow ominously; gargoyles scattering constellations offers striking visual. Sensory details (metal chill, machinery clatter) immerse effectively. Setting-object connection strong through brooch's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "sparks of gravity" resonate but cosmic-weaver ending risks grandiosity. Theme of generational doubt woven throughout but stated overtly. Ending satisfies character arc but galaxies' symphony feels overstated. Shows more than tells in sensory moments but undercuts with explanatory phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ordered disarray" motif prevents complete cliche but cosmic awakening contains generic mythic language. Some purple prose ("abyss's pull dissolved into choice"). Emotional reactions shown through physical sensations (footprints, warmth) but brooch's "testament" risks sentimentality. Style distinctive but occasionally overadorned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively despite high concept density. Cosmic powers feel organic to family legacy rather than forced. Story consciously uses brevity for mystical compression. Lingering question about inherited doubt vs. individual destiny elevates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
