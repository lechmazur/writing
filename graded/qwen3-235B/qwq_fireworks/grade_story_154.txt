<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's 'strongly weak' trait is shown through physical frailty versus determined actions, but lacks depth in personal stakes or evolution; motivation to track social changes is clear but underexplored thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves completeness within word limit: clear beginning (task), middle (journey), resolution (mending strands); pacing is brisk but cohesive, with logical cause-and-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (amber roofs, ink’s starlight shimmer) and mythic elements (Black Thorn, auroras) create immersive, mystical atmosphere aligned with theme of fragile courage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (courage as woven strands) and layered themes; ending ties back to character’s role, prompting reflection on communal resilience, though subtext could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tropes but has occasional overwritten phrases; the Celtic setting leans on generic mythic motifs; emotional nuance present but occasionally overtold vs. shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated with few forced moments; style maintains clarity within lyrical prose; length serves the narrative focus; leaves lingering resonance on vulnerability as courage.</comment>
