<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's reserved nature is evident, but her "oracle" aspects are underdeveloped; motivations tie to preservation but lack layered complexity in connecting her personal history to the broader narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot progresses through clear cause-effect beats (glyphs → discovery → mending → ripple), but the choir's sudden adoption of the lullaby feels rushed; ending ties together themes but with slight narrative compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Laboratory's atmosphere immerses through tactile details like "peeling wallpaper" and "spectral keyboard"; choir practice harmonies contrast with sterile environment; tone balances melancholy and reverence effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges in anonymity theme and quiet legacy; metaphors (threads, ripples) reinforce subtext but occasionally rely on abstract "telling" over concrete "showing" of emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh integration of sound preservation and tactile repair; avoids formulaic clichés through specific imagery (faint scrawls, humming lab); some lyrical passages risk veering into ornateness but mostly succeed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story coheres despite constrained length; elements serve narrative (e.g., choir timeframe mirrors theme) but brief moments (e.g., anonymous historian mention) feel like postscript rather than organic closure.</comment>
