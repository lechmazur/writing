<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (redemption for brother's fate) and emotional resonance in reactions to the map and reflection, but lacks deeper individuality beyond archetypal "tormented inventor" tropes. Assigned attributes like "solitary" shape actions but aren't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from map theft to ritual execution, with demolition timing providing clear endpoint. Pacing tightens too abruptly in climax; sudden "body unraveling" moment sacrifices emotional payoff for spectacle. Assigned action/method alignment strong, but structural compression weakens some transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Quantum beach's decay-beauty duality creates immersive atmosphere through specific details (collapsing star particles, spectral wave hues, sand entropy). Timeframe urgency enhances setting, while "corroded rapture" tone permeates sensory descriptions. Some worldbuilding questions linger unanswered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses striking metaphors ("origami birds scattering debris," "spark detonating") and achieves thematic cohesion around self-erasure/creation. Ending leaves lingering emotional resonance via brother's smile glimpse. Over-reliance on abstract phrasing ("corroded rapture") occasionally obscures deeper meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in quantum mysticism fusion and map-as-living-object concept. Avoids typical AI patterns (no dialogue, limited emotional telling), but "sand crystallizing bridge" feels formulaic. Sensory details specific rather than generic; tone shifts natural despite high weirdness quotient.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements coexist without feeling forced, though holiday ritual subplot remains underutilized. Brevity sacrifices full resolution in favor of poetic closure. Language choices enhance momentum despite occasional ornate phrases ("corroded rapture"). Ending's thematic punch outweighs minor structural compression flaws.</comment>
