<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character is distinct and consistent in motivation, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped despite clear external actions aligning with traits. Subtlety and arrogance are well-woven into behavior but lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from quiet resistance to systemic reclamation, with a tight arc that leverages constraints effectively. Minor pacing dips in middle sections don't disrupt overall coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>World-building excels through sensory contrasts (neon vs. green, synthetic vs. organic) and atmospheric tension. Immersion deepens with specific details like "holograms strangled by vines" but occasionally verges on excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storytelling mastery through layered metaphors, symbolic momentum, and thematically resonant literary devices. The ending achieves poetic closure while maintaining narrative momentum, though subtext remains slightly surface-bound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality thrives in concept execution (seed pods as rebellion) and structural ingenuity. Minimal purple prose detected; emotional resonance shown rather than stated. Occasional descriptors border on overabundance but mostly support vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements unify seamlessly into a cohesive allegory, with brevity amplifying thematic power. Leaves lingering impression of urban possibility and quiet defiance, achieving rare balance between compact form and expansive meaning.</comment>
