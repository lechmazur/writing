<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Characters remain cryptic ciphers; soft-voiced guide's traits surface only in surface descriptors. Partner's silent speech lacks psychological nuance. Motivations stated rather than embodied through action or subtext. Reactions to high-concept elements feel disconnected from tangible emotional cores.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Premise has potential but pacing falters: blackout's apocalyptic weight introduced then resolved too abruptly. Cause-effect chain between train deviation and scream harnessing feels contrived. Tight space strains narrative arc cohesion; key moments lack emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is story's strongest suit: evocative tactile details (flickering threads, groaning cables) and conceptual contrasts (blissful agony) create immersive tension. Setting elements like Floating Cloud Cafe feel conceptually rich but under-integrated into character dynamics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lyrical flourishes overwhelm emotional authenticity. Subtext about silent trauma remains superficial. End lacks thematic resonance - neither closure nor provocative open-endedness achieved. Prose prioritizes texture over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Excessively ornate descriptions border on pastiche - constellations-as-maps, scream-as-visible-light feel derivative. Dialogue reduced to existential platitudes. Sudden shifts without grounding (blackout onset, scream manifestation) suggest underdeveloped logic structures typical of algorithmic fabulism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Technical competence evident but conceptual cohesion lacking. Assigned elements force-march plot rather than organically shape it. Breach between poetic language and narrative purpose weakens overall impact. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution quality.</comment>
