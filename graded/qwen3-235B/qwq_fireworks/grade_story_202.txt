<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivation as a poisoner is present but underexplored; actions (poisoning leads) lack emotional complexity, reducing visceral impact of assigned attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot's scavenger hunt structure drives momentum, but the skateboarding motif feels arbitrarily tacked on; resolution is thematically satisfying despite some rushed transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dust-starlight atmosphere and museum-skatepark contrast create vivid, tactile tension; sensory details (leather creak, gear sounds) immerse reader in liminal space between decay and motion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The closing leap as metaphor for moral gravity and self-confrontation elevates the story; the rapier's "mirror" functions as potent symbol undercutting protagonist's certainty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; skatepark scavenger hunt and "innocently guilty" duality feel inventive; occasional overreliance on abstract phrasing ("edges tested") softens visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements (poisoner, rapier, skatepark) interweave with thematic intent, though museum setting feels underutilized; abrupt tonal shift from mystery to philosophical revelation risks coherence.</comment>
