<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (restoring lost art through rebellion) is consistent but lacks depth in internal conflict; reactions to objects like the mask feel underexplored in shaping distinct personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses through manifestation and mask interaction, but cause-effect logic (e.g., how "fracturing" the labyrinth achieves rebellion) remains nebulous; pacing is uneven, with rushed climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (humming organs, living books), but political rumors and revolution timeframe feel tacked on rather than organically integrated into setting mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic use of masks and manifesting, with resonant theme about choice as reckoning; some emotional beats rely on abstraction rather than tangible character actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fantasy elements subvert literalism (e.g., obituaries as rebellion), but phrases like "kaleidoscope of intent" verge on overused metaphor; revolutionary arc feels both fresh and structurally predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High-concept fusion works but lacks narrative density needed for full emotional impact; the brevity strains thematic cohesion despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
