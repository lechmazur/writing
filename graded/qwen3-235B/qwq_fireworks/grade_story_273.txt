<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Main character has clear motives and purpose but lacks psychological depth; motivation is stated rather than revealed through nuanced character development; limited personal voice due to third-person narration; connection between aristocratic background and current actions insufficiently explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has complete arc from inciting rebellion to result, but pacing feels rushed in key moments; transitions between fortress scenes and revolution occur without sufficient narrative buildup; cause-effect logic holds but some developments feel schematic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Swamp fortress creates compelling isolation and tension; rich sensory details establish mood but unevenly distributed; the "before the universe" timeframe only peripherally connects to narrative; atmospheric elements occasionally overwhelm plot progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vibrant metaphors and poetic language enhance thematic resonance; subtle showing rather than telling about cultural erasure; subtext about storytelling's power well-integrated; ending transcends narrative to connect universal human themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative prose with meaningful symbolism, though occasional purple passages; emotional authenticity through subtle actions rather than declarations; avoids common resistance tropes through specific cultural preservation focus; lyrical quality occasionally undermines narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements contribute meaningfully to core narrative; none feel arbitrarily imposed; concise form becomes strength through metaphorical compression; memorable imagery and theme compensate for slight character underdevelopment; cohesive despite thematic ambition.</comment>
