<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but internal transformation lacks gradual nuance; "peaceful anger" stated more than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but pacing feels slightly compressed; some transitions (e.g., chamber reveal) lack buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (shimmering walls, humming flute) and eerie atmosphere enhance tone and worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing and underexplored tropes (e.g., "quiet fire beneath calm"), though fusion of extinct languages and bone flute offers freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but "planted chances" and timeframe feel secondary; thematically resonant yet lacks lingering, urgent power.</comment>
