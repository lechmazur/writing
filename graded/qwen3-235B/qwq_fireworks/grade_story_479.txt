<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Glamorous undertaker aspect is underexplored; motivations around tradition and remembrance are clear but surface-level. Character's voice exists but isn't distinctive enough to elevate beyond functional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on sudden "hidden thread" reveal that feels slightly contrived within tight constraints. Pacing uneven in early sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie, vivid atmosphere combines tactile details (chiming brass, rippling paint) with digital decay to create haunting tension between ephemeral and eternal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegiac tone and layered metaphors (quantified grief, algorithmic memory) create profound emotional resonance. Ending balances paradoxes thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s; "emotional depth" metric satirizes data culture while fresh imagery (cobalt swallowing sepia) resists predictability. No purple prose detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements intricately interwoven with theme; brief length enhances focus on existential tension rather than feeling limited. Lingering philosophical questions strengthen impact.</comment>
