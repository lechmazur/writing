<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Naivety drives choices but lacks psychological depth; motivations hinted at through repeated gambler archetypes but never transcended into distinctive individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows ritualistic structure but compression flattens emotional beats; sudden reactor surge and shadow swallowing feel rushed rather than inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rust-bitten nautical atmosphere vividly rendered through tactile details (groaning dock, salt-stung eyes) but mythic undertones of tides-as-fate remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Memorable imagery (green candleflame, dissolving memories) clashes with unearned thematic weight; "next time I'll bet smarter" feels narratively hollow rather than existentially resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Mix of noir gamblers and mad scientists teeters toward genre pastiche; candle symbolism and bargains with oblivion echo familiar tropes without subversive reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><comment>Elements superficially integrated without deep cohesion; tight word count reveals rather than hides underdeveloped thematic intersections between gambling, memory, and energy.</comment>
