<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clara's guilt and self-punishment through puzzles are clear, but her internal shift from bitterness to release lacks sufficient emotional buildup within the limited scope, making the catharsis feel abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot’s twist—Clara as the sender—is clever, but the rapid progression through puzzle rooms in the word limit flattens tension; structural cohesion exists, yet some transitions (e.g., mirror scenes) feel rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s claustrophobic atmosphere and sensory details (e.g., groaning rocks, bleeding ink) immerse readers, but the island’s lore remains unexplored, weakening the setting’s thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The string as a symbol of burden and the mirrors’ use for memory are potent. The ending’s subtext—self-destruction as self-discovery—elevates the story, though the brevity limits deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés in its twist but leans on familiar tropes (haunted lighthouse, guilt-ridden protagonist). Some phrases (“bitter truth seeped in”) risk melodrama, and the self-unraveling arc feels derivative of psychological thrillers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story’s tight integration of symbols (string, light) and its haunting conclusion suggest ambition, but the constrained format leaves certain elements (e.g., the brother’s drowning) underdeveloped, undermining full cohesion.</comment>
