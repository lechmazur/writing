<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's awkwardness and hesitation are surface-level traits rather than driving forces; motivation to restore systems lacks emotional grounding despite thematic hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abrupt realizations; cause-effect logic for postcard's power feels contrived; narrative arc compressed awkwardly but maintains minimal coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vividly rendered setting with striking tactile details (frost, steam); atmosphere reinforces theme of fragile balance but occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., crabs as liminal actors) and subtext about impermanence; ending evokes quiet awe but emotional impact diluted by conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise subverts fantasy tropes through crab symbolism, but relies on familiar "chosen one" structure; avoids purple prose but occasionally favors ornate description over forward motion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but unevenly weighted; brevity creates thematic fragmentation; haunting imagery outweighs narrative urgency.</comment>
