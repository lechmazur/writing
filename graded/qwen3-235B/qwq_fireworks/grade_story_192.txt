<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; internal conflicts remain surface-level, though the interplay between the lookout’s longing for connection and her actions provides some depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but feels slightly compressed; the method of analyzing poltergeist activity is logical yet underelaborated, while the resolution bends plausibility without breaking coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly layered atmosphere blending ancient and futuristic elements; vivid sensory details (bioluminescent wood, humming static) immerse readers, though the setting’s symbolic potential remains partially untapped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of analog vs. digital coexistence resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by occasional abstraction; the ending’s subtext about symbiosis lingers but lacks visceral emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on genre tropes (haunted tech, reclusive moguls); prose is purposeful yet occasionally overwrought, with some metaphors (e.g., "digital rot") feeling undercooked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story coheres around its concept but feels constrained by its brevity; elements like the sewing box are ingeniously integrated, but the narrative’s ambition occasionally outpaces its tight framework.</comment>
