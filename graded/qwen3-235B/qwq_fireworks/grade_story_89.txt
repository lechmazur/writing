<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through novel element combinations (stars-as-surveillance, material-spiritual duality) but contains minor purple prose patches and familiar revolt tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through strong central metaphor; some elements (time capsules, star vibrations) feel tacked on rather than organically integrated despite efficient word count usage.</comment>
