<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's role as ghost whisperer informs her connection to lineage but lacks nuanced emotional layers beyond symbolic rebellion. Actions align with motivation, but inner conflict could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot arcs cleanly from ritual to rebellion, but the half-written letter's revelation feels slightly rushed. Pacing balances action and introspection within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and cohesive—Arctic wind, melting ice, frozen insect—all reinforce themes. Sensory details (frost, pulsing amber, peeling posters) immerse reader without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (amber as stasis, thawing heart) and thematic resolution elevate the story. Emotional impact is undercut slightly by abrupt shifts in internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by subverting family tradition tropes. Language is purposeful but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing ("laughter crackled like frost"). Subtext resonates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements synergize to explore legacy and liberation. The brevity feels intentional, with lingering resonance from the interplay of silence, ice, and rebellion.</comment>
