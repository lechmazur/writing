<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s melancholy is present but underexplored; motivation ties to rituals but lacks psychological depth or internal conflict. Actions align with assigned traits, yet voice remains cryptic without emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained through ritual restoration goal; cause-and-effect logic holds despite tight word count. Pacing stumbles slightly with abrupt shifts, but the triangle alignment resolution is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting immersion succeeds via sensory details (rust, paint fumes) and claustrophobic submarine tone. Atmosphere amplifies ritual decay and fragile hope, though steampunk elements feel vaguely generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story evokes contemplation through ritual vs. decay themes. Effective use of tea leaves and triangles as symbols; ending carries emotional weight. Subtext on collective memory is implied but could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While avoiding overt tropes, some elements (rust-scraping, paint as metaphor) lean slightly formulaic. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; tone remains consistent. Metaphors are fresh but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Arc feels cohesive despite constraints. Assigned elements are mostly organic, with tea leaves and inverted chamber as exceptions. Leaves lingering curiosity about ritual’s cosmic stakes, though brevity occasionally undermines depth.</comment>
