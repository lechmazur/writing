<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Main character's traits shape actions but psychological layers remain underexplored; motivations (ambition/purpose) are clear but emotional resonance feels occasionally surface-level despite strong thematic connections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Forward momentum driven by key actions (planting, town's reaction) but some rushed transitions between pivotal moments; cohesive arc exists though tighter structural control over word limit needed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, specific sensory details (citrus cleaner, rust, bioluminescence) create immersive atmosphere; setting meaningfully interacts with theme and character but deeper integration possible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance through metaphor (xerography as replication of intent); memorable imagery and layered subtext about creation/destruction duality; ending rewards thoughtful consideration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh interpretations of elements avoid formulaic patterns; emotional complexity emerges through symbolic interactions rather than explicit statements; prose balances precision with evocative language effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite diverse elements; maintains deliberate brevity while suggesting expansive thematic territory; synthesis of artistic vision and technical execution mostly successful.</comment>
