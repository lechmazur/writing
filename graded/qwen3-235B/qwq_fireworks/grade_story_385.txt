<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clara’s manipulation is clear but underdeveloped; her role as a meddler exists but lacks emotional or psychological depth. Motivation to decode symbols is surface-level, with actions feeling driven by plot demands rather than organic psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing is strained by the word limit; the plot hinges on sudden revelations without sufficient setup or emotional weight. Cause-effect between footprints and the skyscraper’s collapse remains murky despite symbolic ties.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn setting are evocative, but the hospital’s quiet shift underutilized. Sensory details (e.g., salt breeze, corroded skates) add texture but inconsistently ground the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ice skates and symbols function as effective metaphors; the ending’s lingering question adds resonance. Thematic threads about manipulation and fragility are hinted at but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases (“frozen monolith”) lean toward cliché; the footprints-as-method feels mechanically inserted rather than integrated. The skyscraper’s supernatural collapse lacks fresh narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly fused. The hospital setting and central conflict feel secondary to the symbolic puzzle, weakening cohesion. Potential for depth is undercut by rushed execution.</comment>
