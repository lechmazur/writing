<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Potential for depth exists but remains underdeveloped. The revelation of self-forgiveness hinges on underexplored internal conflicts, and the rational mischief feels more like a label than an organic trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Structure is mostly coherent, but the cosmic-to-personal pivot feels abrupt. Some cause-effect moments (e.g., statues melting into moths) lack narrative scaffolding despite efficient word economy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory flourishes (bioluminescent sap, obsidian apples), but the symbolic logic of statues as "fragments of self" strains believability within the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical scaffolding (mirrors, maps) and thematic resonance on apology/self-forgiveness elevate the story, though some poetic flourishes border on excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise (the mind as an orchard with time-stamped moths) subverts expectations, but "living statues" and "moon paths" lean on familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh executionâ€”cohesive themes and poetic language elevate the piece, but the brevity sacrifices deeper emotional payoff.</comment>
