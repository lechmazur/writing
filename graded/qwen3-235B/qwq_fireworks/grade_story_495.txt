<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character displays consistent conflict between duty and longing but lacks nuanced internal complexity; motivations to rediscover joy are clear yet under-explored beyond surface-level contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rapid plot progression from postcard obsession to spacetime rift feels slightly condensed; cause-effect between illustration and mechanical failures lacks gradual buildup within tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory contrasts between metallic sanctuary (grinding gears, chipped paddle) and organic island (fireflies, coral birds) create immersive, emotionally resonant atmospheres that deepen the central theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like bread paddle as compass and fading postcards carry thematic weight; ending balances emotional resolution with lingering sorrow, though subtext remains more implicit than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but postcard concept leans on familiar magical realism tropes; prose is elegant without excessive ornamentation, though spacetime folds feel underdeveloped rather than synthetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through recurring symbolic objects but occasionally prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative efficiency; leaves resonant thematic questions about freedom and loss.</comment>
