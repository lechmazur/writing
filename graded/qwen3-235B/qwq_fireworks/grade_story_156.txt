<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks deep interiority; motivations (confusion, duty) are present but underexplored. The spare key drives plot but isn't fully integrated into their psychology. Voice remains generic despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but relies on abrupt epiphanies. Bird data revelation feels underprepared; pacing balances exposition with action but stumbles during the council confrontation. Coherence maintained despite tight limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (salt's sting, crystalline pillars) create immersive atmosphere. The salt mine setting enhances themes of fragility and isolation. Timeframe feels natural to the contemplative tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance through paradoxes—joy/tragedy, order/freedom. Strong imagery (wind chime laughter, fractal patterns) elevates theme. Ending achieves satisfying synthesis without oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("counterpoints endless"). Subverts oppressive hierarchy trope well, though character reasoning sometimes feels algorithmically logical rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere structurally but not thematically. The brief format works for meditative tone yet strains complex philosophical ideas. Leaves lingering questions about conformity vs. evolution.</comment>
