<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's introverted nature and dancer background shape her analytical yet non-linear methods, but emotional depth beyond obsession feels surface-level. Relationship with Eli sketched but lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently from decoding to escape, using knitting as both method and symbolism. Narrative arc is complete but rushed; cause-effect between charts and storm cycles feels underdeveloped despite logical premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pungent details (burnt wiring, glowing threads) and juxtaposed settings (claustrophobic office vs. vast wasteland) create immersive duality. Atmosphere amplifies tension between entrapment and yearning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose elevates craft: knitting as coded language, stars as bodily rhythms. Ending resonates with quiet defiance, showing rather than stating hope. Subtext of art as survival is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s by intertwining dance, astronomy, and textiles innovatively. Emotions shown through gesture (a nod, a stitch) prevent sentimentality. Some ornate phrases ("illogically logical") risk feeling contrived but mostly enhance mystique.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>All elements serve symbolic and plot functions cohesively. Brevity enhances mythic tone without feeling truncated. Leverages constraints to explore escape-as-identity, leaving echoes of wonder post-reading.</comment>
