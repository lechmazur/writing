<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character shows consistent traits and a clear arc but lacks specific personal history to deepen investment. Her "hardheaded" nature informs actions but could be more idiosyncratically expressed. Reaction to the mirror reveals vulnerability but stays somewhat generalized rather than emotionally transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Predictable progression through mystical revelations lacks structural innovation. Connection between beginning and end is thematic but lacks narrative surprise. Pacing is generally managed within constraints but lacks tension or complexity in revealing the story's secrets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory descriptions create a distinct atmosphere but occasionally overwhelm. The ephemeral art gallery concept connects well with themes of transience. Contrast between snowy exterior and mystical interior supports emotional arc but could better integrate the "snow days" timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (mirror, ephemeral art) but occasionally veers into purple prose. Ending feels emotionally coherent but not deeply surprising. Theme of vulnerability as power is clear but conventional. Lacks distinctive literary voice that would elevate impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contains fresh concepts (ephemeral art gallery, specific formulation of power's cost) but relies on fantasy tropes (mystical prophecies, hidden wisdom). Language occasionally flows naturally but has ornate tendencies. Subverts "treasure in a safe" expectation but follows conventional self-discovery arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but not memorably. The brief length could be more radical in structure. Some evidence of creative thinking (mirror as safe contents) but overall lacks distinctive approach to elevate above competent to exceptional.</comment>
