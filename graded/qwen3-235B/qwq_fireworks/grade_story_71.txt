<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Scarce emotional depth undermines static character; oath motivation consistent but lacks human nuance, rendering "fervent apathy" more conceptual than experiential through the hollow, unchanging scarecrow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vignette-style progression between worlds maintains momentum despite constrained word count; plot completeness achieved through cyclical duty ritual, though VR confrontation feels somewhat disconnected from ancient setting imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Evocative fossilized giant imagery clashes with modern VR elements; inconsistent sensory integration between eerie ancient atmosphere and digital settings weakens cohesive immersion despite striking individual details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lace fan symbolism and oath-as-cold-fire metaphors create thematic depth; poetic prose elevates tension between preservation and dissolution, though detached narration limits emotional impact beyond intellectual intrigue.</commit>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique fantasy-VR hybrid, but "dissolving into pixels" feels derivative; tonal shifts between mythic and digital occasionally strain credibility despite inventive core concept of oath-keeping via skewering.</commit>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><commit>Elements cohere thematically around boundary-preservation but struggle tonally; VR method feels artificially inserted rather than organically integrated, diminishing story's potential to transcend conceptual framework into visceral experience.</commit>
