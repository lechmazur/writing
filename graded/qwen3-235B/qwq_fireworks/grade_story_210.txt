<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's scholarly nature is evident but 'amiable' doesn't manifest through interaction; motivation is implied but lacks emotional depth, with passive reactions that don't fully reveal inner life.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect but feels compressed; crossword-to-ritual progression is coherent yet rushed, with abrupt tonal shifts between technical clues and mystical climax within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich setting with vibrating timbers and spectral whispers immerses reader; lighthouse as physical and metaphorical liminal space directly enhances mystery and character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bridge between realms" and dissolving crossword create thematic resonance; emotional impact is cerebral rather than visceral, with layered exploration of time/history slightly undercut by abstract conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√©s; ship logs and spiraling shadows feel fresh; ornate descriptions occasionally teeter on edge of purple prose but mostly serve atmospheric cohesion rather than distract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story coalesces assigned elements into unified whole; lighthouse's dual beams as thematic backbone works conceptually but brevity creates tension between poetic abstraction and narrative clarity.</comment>
