<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations shift too abruptly (curiosity to myth-making). “Docile bruiser” lacks sufficient physical/behavioral texture. Calmness is consistent but underexplored as a trait shaping choices beyond confrontation with plants.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Twist provides narrative cohesion. Pacing feels hurried during moral dilemma resolution, but cause/effect between baton use and plant dissolution remains logical. Tight arc for the word limit, though the thematic pivot to myth-making lacks gradual buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse labyrinth’s oppressive humidity and carnivorous flora create visceral immersion. Drum solos as the composer’s “voice” connect timeframe and setting elegantly. Batons’ slick coldness and glowing tip anchor sensory logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mythic subtext elevates genre tropes. The baton’s symbolism—control vs. release—resonates powerfully. Ending’s statuesque transformation avoids sentimentality while echoing the theme of art as transfiguration. Emotional restraint amplifies impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés initially but leans on familiar “sentient predator plant” archetypes. The twist on “treasure” works, though some phrasing (“collage of guttural clicks”) feels overly elaborate. Drum solos as a narrative device border on arbitrary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (language barriers → myth as translation), but mechanical integration varies. Labyrinth structure feels obligatory rather than organic. Brevity serves the haunting tone but sacrifices depth in secondary character moments.</comment>
