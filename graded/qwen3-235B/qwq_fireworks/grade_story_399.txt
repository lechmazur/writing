<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness as armor is hinted but lacks nuance; motivations around trauma are implied but underdeveloped; transformation feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but pacing stumbles—memory surge/resolution too rushed; cause-effect logic in sand-to-stars metaphor struggles with credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere has striking visuals (stained glass, obsidian) but leans on gothic clichés; sensory details often overwhelm rather than enhance thematic intent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Witch’s "bridge between worlds" line feels derivative; some fresh linkages (cardboard tube as trauma vessel) contrast with predictable "light vs. shadows" binaries.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but lack integrative elegance; thematic ambition outpaces execution in tight word count; ends on a promising but undercooked note.</comment>
