<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s assigned trait (moral code) shapes actions superficially but lacks inner conflict depth; motivations remain stated rather than revealed through nuanced behavior or dilemma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot coherence is achieved despite brevity, but the connection between bottle caps and the vault’s security feels contrived; pacing is uneven during key revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting fails to integrate assigned elements meaningfully; the reimagined Roman marketplace is stylistically flat, with sensory details that are generic and underused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Storytelling uses symbolism (bottle caps as legacy fragments) and subtext about historical erasure effectively, culminating in a resonant, layered ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging ancient and futuristic motifs, though “confident uncertainty” tone occasionally lapses; avoids clichés in character reasoning and atmospheric layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story feels constrained by assigned elements; some, like “tea steeping,” are arbitrary rather than integral to the narrative’s momentum or thematic weight.</comment>
