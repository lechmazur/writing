<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks layered internal conflict exploration; "eagerly unwilling" attribute surfaces through actions but lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates tight cohesion between storm-chasing and tapestry decoding, but pacing stumbles slightly in the desert-to-monastery transition, leaving some cause-effect gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert and alpine settings create vivid atmospheric contrasts, though sensory details in desert sequences could deepen to fully immerse; cold/warm texture contrasts enhance thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story reveals emotional resonance through symbolic bridges of legacy/innovation; ending achieves thematic closure through metaphor of storms as creative forces rather than just machinery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in tapestry-as-blueprint concept, but some phrasing ("fogged icy air") verges on conventionality; metaphors like "music of winds" strike fresh notes within familiar mystical framework.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve dual narrative purposes (storm energy as both plot device and emotional struggle), though carousel's magical realism could feel more earned than wondrous exposition; lingers through layered endings.</comment>
