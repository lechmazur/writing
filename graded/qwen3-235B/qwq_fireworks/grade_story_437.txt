<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Spineless leader lacks consistent internal conflict; motivations shift without full emotional grounding. Use of photographs as symbolic anchors is strong but underdeveloped in revealing character psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid cause-effect between rainfall, dome collapse, and character transformation. Pacing tight yet maintains logical progression; beginning/end symmetry through owl's destruction and floral revelation feels purposefully cyclical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Acidic rain and greenhouse decay create memorable visuals but underutilize tactile/sensory immersion (e.g., smell of toxicity, sting of tears). The static hum of generators hints at sound, but overall atmosphere remains visually one-note.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Floral-personal parallels (sister's face/bloom) create emotional resonance. Over-reliance on "whispers" and "statically dynamic" phrases dilutes impact; subtext about borrowed purpose vs. authentic connection remains partially submerged.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some striking metaphors (tears as "bridges") emerge organically, but "toxic gray" descriptors verge on clich√©. Dialogue remains cryptic rather than revealingly symbolic; "statically dynamic" repetition feels more formulaic than purposefully recursive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but lack tight interweaving - owl's destruction feels more symbolic than narratively earned. Brief length accentuates thematic contrasts (decay/rebirth) but shortchanges follower development, reducing collective impact.</comment>
