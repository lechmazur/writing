<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Guard's distraction and guilt drive actions effectively, but internal conflict lacks visceral nuance; motivation feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Sister's haunting remains underexplored beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Focused cause-effect chain anchors plot; unraveling ribbon catalyzes clear arc. However, pivotal bridge revelation feels conceptually compressed within tight word count despite effective momentum toward climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory alchemy makes infernal kitchen palpableâ€”steam/sound/silence interplay creates oppressive atmosphere. Timeframe's existential waiting room tone deepens immersion without feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (voice as currency, silence as antagonist). Ending rejects expected catharsis, privileging painful transformation over cheap redemption. Subtext about linguistic sacrifice permeates structure without becoming didactic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic spine cohesively despite ambitious interweaving. Brevity heightens tension rather than constraining it. Final image of "wound becoming threshold" lingers provocatively, refusing easy resolution.</comment>
