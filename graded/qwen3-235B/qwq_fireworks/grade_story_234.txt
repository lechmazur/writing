<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (unresolved grief, quest for cosmic understanding) are alluded to but underexplored; "gentle swordsman" paradox lacks dramatization; psychological nuance sacrificed to brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tightly packed plot mechanics prioritize mystery-solving over organic progression; some transitions (e.g., fossil rib â†’ hidden chamber) feel mechanically convenient rather than logically grounded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visually evocative but emotionally distant; museum's prehistoric bones juxtaposed with cosmic wonder works conceptually, though sensory immersion remains superficial despite strong opening.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic resonance about humility before mystery emerges powerfully in conclusion, but emotional beats (grief, revelation) often summarized rather than embodied through action or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of concrete images ("hollow eye sockets") and cosmic abstraction creates tension; occasionally veers into vague metaphysical abstraction ("cradle the infinite") that feels more decorative than thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ideas-rich but execution-imbalanced; some elements (sundial riddle, dog silence timeframe) feel like checklist items rather than organic components of a unified artistic vision.</comment>
