<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's "measured" demeanor is shown (hand closing on tassel, deliberate unplugging), but motivations rooted in revenge's moral cost lack sufficient emotional grounding. Dialogue feels slightly detached from human nuance despite crisp voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from initial mission to thematic conclusion, but the bandit confrontation's rapid escalation feels compressed. Genetic patterns as plot engine works logically but pacing stumbles in mid-section debris navigation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful sensory integration - peeling velvet/must/drum circles create physical and psychological decay. Setting amplifies both mystery (tattered theater) and horror (genetic experiments in city hall).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>"Revenge as loop" theme through organic/synthetic duality creates profound subtext. Metaphor of unweaving debt through tassel removal resonates. Ending transcends trope through embodied abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by merging biopunk elements with moral philosophy. Language purposeful despite occasional overwrought phrases ("abrasive calm"). Emotional progression implied through symbolic actions rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere through shared thematics of decay and creation. Tight focus maximizes limited space, though bandit leader's backstory feels underserved. Lingering thematic resonance elevates structural constraints.</comment>
