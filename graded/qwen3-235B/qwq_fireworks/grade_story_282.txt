<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation to revive traditional games aligns with actions, but limited depth beyond core trait; "consciously wild" manifests in plot mechanics more than nuanced characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compelling cause-effect through medal’s destruction reigniting the pinball machine; tight structure with resonant beginning-to-end transformation within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the discount store’s decayed grandeur; dust, light, and metallic relics coalesce into a mythic mundane atmosphere that elevates the premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (nautilus as bridge between chaos/order, medal’s reciprocity as sacrifice); theme of resurrecting dying traditions through radical acts lingers beyond the final line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in subverting "relic" tropes (forgotten medal as power source, using geometry rather than magic); avoids florid overdescription while maintaining lyrical precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements serve thematic cohesion; economy in brief length feels intentional, leaving resonance through implied futures beyond the "next heist" closing line.</comment>
