<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cynicism and arrogance drive the conjurer's actions, but his internal conflict lacks depth beyond intellectual realization. The keeper's motivations are hinted at but remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ritual propels the plot efficiently, with cause-and-effect between celestial alignment, incantation, and spectral emergence.

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as lighthouse, shared isolation as eternity) are evocative but prioritized over emotional weight.

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subverts "lone wizard" tropes through humility in failure, but some phrases ("spectral and familiar") border on cliche. Language balances poeticism and clarity, though "borrowed century" concept occasionally leans on abstraction over cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly around isolation-as-metaphor, though thematic density occasionally overshadows narrative intimacy. Brief length accentuates the story’s contemplative weight, leaving lingering resonance through visual symbolism over character immersion.</comment>
