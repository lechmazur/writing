<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., "coat stitched from shadows") but occasionally overelaborate phrasing risks obscuring narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere around theme, though some (airport lounge) feel more atmospheric than plot-driven; conclusion lingers with reflective weight.</comment>
