<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but superficially developed; the mage’s compassion is inconsistently demonstrated, and her internal conflict regarding "hopeful brutality" lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in key moments (e.g., shadow-child dissolution). Rivet-alignment method ties plot together, but trunk’s "silence" resolution feels disconnected from setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (rust, locket’s chill), but genre-blending (fantasy/espionage) creates tonal dissonance; submarine’s significance is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact through subversion (shadow as child) and symbolism (locket as mirror), but pacing sacrifices depth in character and thematic connections.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (submarine-as-prison, locket memories) but leans on familiar tropes (ancient evils, magical inheritances). Prose is purposeful, though some phrasing ("hopeful brutality") feels strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coalesces despite disparate elements, but some (e.g., secret agent center) feel arbitrary. Rivet method and trunk-resolution showcase creative integration, while the "brutality" theme remains undercooked.</comment>
