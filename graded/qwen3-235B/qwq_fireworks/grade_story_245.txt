<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has some depth through grief and guilt, but motivations (rage vs. memorializing loss) lack nuanced complexity; actions align with traits but emotional layers remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery of data-slug to vault confrontation and symbolic canteen-spilling, but ending feels abrupt; tight structure benefits from clear cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport grittiness is vividly rendered through sensory details (crunching gravel, static wind) but worldbuilding occasionally feels stylized rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism (tea leaves, shattered chopstick) and poetic imagery creates emotional resonance; ending's subtextual meditation on memory elevates craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi and Zen-like metaphors avoids most clich√©s; risks purple prose in moments but generally justifies stylistic flourishes; emotional through-lines feel humanly complex.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion through recurring symbols despite constrained form; elements serve thematic unity over checklist adherence; the "remember" revelation adds lingering resonance.</comment>
