<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Limited interiority undermines motivation; transformation lacks causality; "sneering" trait inconsistently fades; voice remains static despite pivotal discoveries; reactions to objects/setting feel performative rather than revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear but rushed arc; action sequences drive plot effectively; vault climax resolves primary quest but introduces unexplored questions; pacing uneven during machinery activation; atmospheric shifts better developed than character decisions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rich visual details overwhelm tactile/aural dimensions; setting's alien nature inconsistently applied (e.g., human-scale vaults); atmospheric hush conceptually intriguing but under-integrated; sensory specificity clashes with vague mechanical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors about desperation vs. ambition; ending sparks reflection on legacy cycles; conflict between myth and tangible achievement compelling; showing dominates but lacks visceral emotional beats; theme of human impermanence could resonate deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh, specific imagery ("language curled like smoke") counters occasional abstraction ("rambling dark"); avoids algorithmic repetition; emotional progression feels earned rather than stated; tone maintains eerie consistency; "sneering" trope subverted through character's silent evolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Element integration clever but surface-level; brief format constraints oddly amplify mythic tone; lingering questions intentional rather than accidental; some assigned elements feel checklist-driven; style occasionally prioritizes lushness over clarity.</comment>
