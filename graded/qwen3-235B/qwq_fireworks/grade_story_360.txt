<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's meekness contrasts with her determined quest, creating internal conflict. Glimpses of emotional depth, but secondary characterizations (goblin's wisdom) feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear trajectory from problem to resolution, but compressed pacing strains the dew-drop epiphany's weight. Logical cause-effect but lacks emotional beats during key turning points.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid fungal bioluminescence and dew-refracted light immerse readers. The goblin playground's juxtaposition of mirth and melancholy enhances atmosphere, though city culture remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry as interconnected lives/death, pen's rebirth) resonate strongly. Ending's thematic convergence of light/shadow duality elevates narrative beyond surface quest.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subverts necromancy tropes by focusing on mending rather than destruction. The broken nib's transformation through dew avoids mechanical plotting. Some descriptive passages verge on ornate but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements coalesce meaningfully into the tapestry motif's revelations. The brevity sharpens focus on pivotal moments, though deeper worldbuilding would strengthen emotional stakes.</comment>
