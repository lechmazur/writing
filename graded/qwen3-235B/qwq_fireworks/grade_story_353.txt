<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is purposeful but lacks deeper exploration of internal conflict; motivations are clear and consistent with actions, but limited personal stakes beyond the surface-level vendetta against tyranny.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains a tight arc despite constraints; some rushed exposition (e.g., time machine mechanics), but causal logic holds and the ending ties back effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Immersion is strong in pockets (e.g., bakery-garage juxtaposition, orchard scene) but undermined by inconsistent tonal clashes between mystical elements and grounded details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through layered metaphors and symbolic subtext; pacing issues don’t detract from the story’s thematic potency and vivid, imagistic prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés by blending surreal elements in fresh ways, though occasional overreliance on abstract descriptors strains credibility; the narrative voice feels distinctive but leans on poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole, though some (e.g., moon patterns) feel appended rather than necessary; compactness amplifies urgency but underdevelops secondary stakes.</comment>
