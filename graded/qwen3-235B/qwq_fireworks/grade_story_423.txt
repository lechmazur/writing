<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterized by earnest purpose, but lacks interiority depth; motivations stated more than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot driven by astronomical map's revelation, but resolution via magical plant growth feels abrupt; temporal shifts between past/future weaken throughline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive desert and greenhouse settings, with effective sensory details about decay and rebirth; "between mountain passes" timeframe underspecified but atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism in constellations/tears connection and mural-knight parallel; somewhat undercut by abrupt mystical transformations that prioritize concept over organic development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids cloying tropes through specific imagery (crimson vines, "liquid fire"), but "canvas of life" clich√© and occasionally portentous phrasing ("stated concepts") weaken fresh impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compelling integration of assigned elements with thematic spine, but overly tidy resolution sacrifices narrative tension; stylistic ambition outpaces structural rigor.</comment>
