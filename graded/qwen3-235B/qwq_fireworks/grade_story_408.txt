<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation ties to pacifism but lacks depth in exploring soldier background; actions align with resistance to tradition but internal conflict feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent but rushed during the cave revelation and confrontation; connections between setup and climax are implied rather than fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through storm-ravaged orchard imagery and metallic decay; sensory details like the rusted nail and corrupted apples create haunting, cohesive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (nail as beacon, crimson apples) and thematic tension around tradition vs. rebellion; ending resonates with subtext but emotional depth could be richer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes by reworking family tradition into grotesque ecological horror; metaphors and tonal contrasts feel specific, original, and purposefully unsettling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>All elements integrated cohesively; short length emphasizes thematic punch rather than feeling restrictive; lingering questions about cost of survival elevate the narrative.</comment>
