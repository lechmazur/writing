<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Static, underexplored character defined more by abstract traits than lived experience; motivation implied through plot mechanics rather than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tightly structured but occasionally rushed transitions between revelations; the temporal loop concept resolves with clever circularity yet strains credibility in compressed form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory layering (forges, library dust) grounds the surrealism; the atmospheric tension between entropy and preservation is sharply rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor (trades as living fossils) and haunting subtext about documenting impermanence; emotional undercurrents are subtle but resonant in final scenes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inversion (future echoes as alphabet rather than overt warnings); precise, unadorned prose with minimal AI-typical flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion outweighs structural tightness; elements serve concept but occasionally strain under the weight of allegory; lingers more than it moves.</comment>
