<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack deeper exploration of immortality's psychological weight; actions align with traits but emotional layers could be more nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels slightly rushed in key transitions (e.g., sudden tree bloom); cause/effect logic holds but lacks thematic payoff in brief conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively juxtaposes decay and hope with sensory details like "quantum sap" and "ash-sweet peach," but worldbuilding occasionally leans on vague futuristic descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink patterns as maps, "rigidly flexible" balance) add depth; ending's circularity with earbud returning to orchard resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers toward lyrical abstraction ("etched by erased epochs") that risks feeling contrived; emotional resonance stronger in imagery than internal monologue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel optimized for symbolism over organic progression; ending lingers but overall impact undercut by occasional overdetermined details.</comment>
