<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has surface-level depth; past trauma hinted but not fully explored. Motivation consistent but lacks emotional complexity. Internal conflict implied rather than shown through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Puzzles drive plot effectively, but resolution feels rushed. Logical progression strained by abrupt thematic shifts and underdeveloped stakes within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on contrasts: sterile science vs. mysticism. Sensory details (crucifix glinting, humming postcard) masterfully evoke tension. Setting functions as character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Symbolic layering (MÃ¶bius strip, "SYNTHESIS") elevates theme. Lingering questions about redemption anchor emotional impact. Subtext enriches surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blends exorcism and science innovatively but relies on familiar haunted object tropes. Language balances purposeful detail with occasional ornateness. Overall style distinct but uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements feel mostly integrated, though some (inwardly social) underexploited. Tight structure sacrifices depth for cohesion. Leaves thematic questions but lacks transformative finality.</comment>
