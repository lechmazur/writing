<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve tradition is clear but her spirituality/irreligion remains abstract. The coat button and codex reflect her internal conflict effectively, but her 'spiritually secular' trait lacks concrete manifestation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from transmission to decision, but the child's interjection interrupts pacing. The bridge concept ties beginning and end together, though some transitions between action and introspection feel abrupt in the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Barren spaceport and stained coffee create evocative, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details (rust smell, visor fog) anchor the setting, though 'fractal sorrow' tone is better shown than explained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden writing elevates theme of unity-as-action. Final codex page offers resonant closure. Emotional impact stems from symbols (button, stains) rather than exposition, though some phrases ("shuddered engines") border on clich√©.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original integration of coffee-stain divination avoids genre tropes. Language remains purposefully lyrical without excess ornamentation. Spiritual/secular dichotomy feels underexplored but deliberate. No formulaic phrasing detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize tightly: the timer's urgency, bridge symbolism, and tactile details (button, coffee) cohere around central theme. Brevity enhances tension rather than limiting depth. Lingering philosophical resonance achieved.</comment>
