<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stoicism is consistently portrayed through physicality and reactions, but emotional contradictions (laughing, raw confession) lack deeper psychological exploration; beekeeper’s personal connection feels convenient rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong inciting incident and thematic throughline, but pivotal transitions (wallet return, lullaby coordinates) rely on coincidence; ending feels abrupt despite effective symbolic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moments of vivid specificity (salt-caked boots, bees as confetti) contrast with generic elements (thorned hedges); atmosphere evokes mood but fails to fully ground the world’s rules or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (Morse code as wingbeats, storms pollinating) are inventive, and the ending’s thematic resonance lands—but emotional impact is diluted by overuse of poetic abstraction rather than earned character vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with unique pairings (beekeeper/sanctuary), but some phrasing veers toward literary ornamentation (“gasps sharp as compass needles”); emotional sincerity occasionally feels imposed rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements serve plot but strain cohesion (e.g., radio transmitting lullabies as coordinates strains plausibility); poignant moments undercut by occasionally self-conscious prose; thematic undercurrents linger but aren’t fully developed.</comment>
