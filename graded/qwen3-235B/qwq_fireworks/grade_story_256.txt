<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth in exploring internal conflict; disloyalty drives action but feels underexplored compared to loyalty. The "kindly" aspect is mostly stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has arc but pacing stumbles mid-story; abrupt transitions in time/space feel underjustified despite word limits. Typewriter ritual and horizon quest connect beginning and end, but grocery-store-aisle climax lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere rich in surreal imagery (espresso tasting of starlight, static-faced strangers) but undersells sensory specifics like the mist's texture or typewriter's exact sound to deepen immersion in "soft edges."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates themes of temporal fragmentation, but emotional impact is muted by abstract concepts; ending's philosophical resonance is undercut by unclear symbolic payoff for Orin’s transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>No clichés; metaphors (horizon as door, despair stored like groceries) feel fresh. Some phrases flirt with ornateness ("midnight aisles stretched endlessly") but avoid AI-like redundancy; tone remains consistent and inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion is uneven: typewriter rhythm and measuring spoon feel integral, but floating cafe’s role diminishes post-opening. Brief length serves tone but strains plot progression; thematic unity wavers around loyalty vs. disloyalty’s implications.</comment>
