<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear (Eli helping ghost, ghost seeking closure) but lack psychological depth. The "elegantly clumsy" trait appears as surface description rather than shaping meaningful action. Ghost’s emotional arc resolves through minimal dialogue, while Eli’s profession-as-motivation feels underexplored beyond plot convenience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc but relies on convenient progression (bell resolving issue without prior foreshadowing). The assigned action "dissect" shapes early scenes but recedes in importance. Cause-effect logic (ghost’s release through petal scattering) feels symbolically coherent but undermotivated within the story’s realism. Pacing balances character moments against plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Laboratory’s sand castle preservation setting creates richly atmospheric contrast between ephemeral natural forms and artificial preservation. Sensory details (resin scent, metallic clinks) immerse readers in the eerie hush. Timeframe of lunch breaks adds subtle urgency. However, connection between elevator repair and supernatural elements remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (silence as dissonance) and symbol (flower crown as unresolved trauma) create thematic resonance. Subtext about ephemeral vs. permanent enriches narrative. The final scattering of petals provides satisfying closure to both ghost’s arc and Eli’s character growth. Literary devices enhance rather than overwhelm narrative, though tonal self-consciousness occasionally edges toward preciosity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Reverses expected "rescue ghost" trope by making release collaborative. Avoids clichés in portraying Eli as a grounded technician rather than romantic hero. Some sensory descriptions border on overwrought ("fractured whispers") and narrative beats (bell solution) feel slightly formulaic. Emotional nuance emerges through action rather than explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates multiple elements while maintaining emotional throughline. Brief format serves thematic compression rather than feeling restricted. Ending’s philosophical reflection ("holding space until silence could speak") suggests depth but risks overgeneralization. Overall structure demonstrates craftsmanship, though individual element connections could be tighter.</comment>
