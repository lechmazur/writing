<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits of panic and environmental concern are clear but lack depth; motivation (to shape destiny) is inconsistent with mercenary past mentioned once. Sarcastic voice is distinct but insufficiently nuanced to compensate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but uneven pacing—middle section drags despite tight word count. The arc (panic to action) works but transitions between water ring visions and external reactions could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, ironic atmosphere (neon vs. decay) enhances theme. Sensory details (synthetic sweat, shattered billboards) ground the reader. Desert setting and tone mesh flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (puzzle box as stewardship, neon as consumerism) elevates the narrative. Ending’s abrupt hope feels slightly dissonant with earlier cynicism, but subtext about complicity/responsibility is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "neon maze") but occasionally veers into purple prose ("molten sarcasm"). Avoids genre tropes through irony but some phrasing (e.g., "roots pulsed") feels generically resonant.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Compelling concept undone by uneven execution. The puzzle box and "bare hands" theme are cohesive, but forced water ring methodology and underexplored character psychology weaken integration.</comment>
