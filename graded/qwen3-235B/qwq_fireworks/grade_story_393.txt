<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's alchemical expertise and familial motivation are clear but underexplored; actions align with goals but lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot efficiently progresses from cipher to sacrifice, but coincidences strain credibility; abrupt transitions in middle weaken momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (tar's stench, glowing moss) create immersive, eerie atmosphere that powerfully reinforces themes of organic decay/transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("lit match" lineage) and layered symbolism (chrysalis as sacrifice motif) create haunting emotional resonance through subtext rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with suburban alchemy twist, but some AI-like phrasing ("failed alchemical experiments," "chain-reactive coincidences") weakens originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element integration is purposeful but occasionally forced; short form enhances mythic quality rather than limiting it, though emotional impact feels abbreviated.</comment>
