<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment> Eli's motivation as plant researcher is clear but underdeveloped; his unluckiness feels like backstory frosting rather than influencing decisions. While the sextant connects to his grandfather, character voice lacks distinctiveness and emotional depth during critical choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment> Plot progression through shortcut to crisis feels contrived but functional. Meteors-as-conflict lacks organic buildup; resolution via sextant alignment strains credibility. Pacing uneven - compressed city intro and rushed climax undermine cause-effect clarity in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment> Bioluminescent moss and spiraling stone spires create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere. Heat from "bitter honey glow" and scurrying sounds immerse readers. "Systematically chaotic" setting meaningfully shapes alien architecture and cultural logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment> Cosmic vs. terrestrial tensions create thematic depth. Dialogue carries weight despite formulaic "truths like stars" ending. Some telling ("heart raced") dilutes showing, but sextant-as-metaphor for colliding worlds elevates craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment> Fresh concept (celestial plants as planetary shield) distinguishes proceedings. However, "lizard people" borderline clich√©, and emotional peaks often declaimed rather than embodied. Prose mostly purposeful but occasionally strains with forced cosmic metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment> Elements work in service of narrative: sextant enables salvation, plants justify setting. Bitter tone ties to thematic gravity. While word count limits complexity, story suggests deeper lore (meteor-plant connection) without overstaying its welcome.</comment>
