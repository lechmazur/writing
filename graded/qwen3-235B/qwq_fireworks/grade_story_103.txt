<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (duty vs. family) is clear, and interactions with objects (compass, doll) effectively reveal backstory. However, the knight's internal conflict remains underexplored beyond surface guilt, relying on archetypal "broken hero" tropes without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a logical arc of object-driven revelation and redemption, but the climax feels abrupt. The transition from mirror choice to pattern-alignment resolves the central conflict too neatly, undermining the 'impossible' premise. Pacing falters in character-driven moments (e.g., sister's death flashback). </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively oppressive: jagged reefs and flickering mirrors create claustrophobic unease. Weather motifs and tactile details (cold brass, fraying mail) immerse readers. However, the reef's "living prism" core leans into abstract fantasy without sufficient grounding in earlier realism, slightly diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (objects as fragments of truth, mirrors as self-confrontation) elevates the narrative. The ending's thematic marriage of "appreciating love's cost" and "embracing human agony" resonates emotionally. Subtlety falters in the final line's heavy-handed summation, undermining earlier poetic restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by intertwining psychological torment with magical realism. Sensory details (warm brass knocker, vibrating cries) feel purposeful, not ornamental. Slight overuse of "grudgingly sweet" verges on affectation, but the reef’s starlight dissolution and mirrored choice structure demonstrate inventive, non-formulaic worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically: the lighthouse’s structure demands object-pattern deduction; impossible choices necessitate the reflective timeframe. The concise format serves the story’s metaphorical scope rather than limiting it. Ending balances resolution and ambiguity, leaving a lingering meditation on guilt and humanity.</comment>
