<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is consistent with traits (rebellion through blending tradition/modernity), but internal complexity lacks depth—no nuanced contradictions or vulnerabilities to elevate beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing falters in compressed arc; the volcano's "rebirth" resolution feels abrupt. Plot hinges on glyphs' mechanics being hand-waved as mystical, undermining logical cause-effect. Repetitive "echo" motif distracts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details (obsidian veins, luminescent moss) excel. Setting cohesion falters slightly—lava flow coffee shop’s relevance feels superficial beyond aesthetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric imagery and theme of cyclical reinvention resonate. Subtext about cultural preservation vs. evolution is clear but underdeveloped. Ending’s metaphorical weight lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on semi-generic "chosen lineage" tropes. Some ornate phrasing ("whispered of a city swallowed by fire") borders on purple prose. Subtle emotional showing, yet rebellion feels underexplored beyond surface defiance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally serve the narrative, but tightness wavers (coffee shop’s ambient role vs. plot irrelevance). Theme resonates, but compression flattens thematic nuances. Lingering impact is moderate—evocative but not transformative.</comment>
