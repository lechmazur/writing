<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear (closure for team's disappearance) but inner conflict remains underdeveloped; actions align with resolve but lack deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot effectively uses environmental clues (coffee grounds/cutlass) to drive action but resolution feels rushed; beginning-to-end connection exists but lacks full dramatic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich with specific details (salt spray/mangroves/solar hum), but the digital nomad setting isn't fully exploited to deepen character or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (tool-turned-key) and thematic contrast between medicine/betrayal work well; emotional impact is undercut by exposition on plague origins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original blend of historical mystery/thriller elements avoids major clich√©s; some descriptions border on ornate but maintain atmospheric purposefulness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with some mechanical seams showing; brevity serves mystery pacing but limits thematic expansion.</comment>
