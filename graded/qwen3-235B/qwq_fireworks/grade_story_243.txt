<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's jumpiness informs his hesitant actions but lacks deeper psychological layers; motivation to unmask the icon is clear but underexplored thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot's revelation-driven structure works within constraints, but pacing falters during the sentry confrontation; resolution feels abrupt despite logical cause-effect chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Retro video game world's sensory details (arcade sounds, glitching pixels) and slumbering gods' atmosphere create immersive, cohesive setting; fishhook's lunar glow integrates seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (altered mural as cultural amnesia, fishhook as truth-revealer) and thematically resonant twist elevate impact; prose occasionally overwrites tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original combination of protest mural analysis and video game glitch-world subverts genre tropes, but "old gods" concept feels underdeveloped; avoids most AI-writing markers except occasional ornate flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements synergize into thematically cohesive whole; retro setting and mural-analysis method particularly innovative; truncated character arc slightly undermines overall cohesion.</comment>
