<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's duality as deserter/reconstructor is compelling, with clear motivation to break cycles, but desires could be more viscerally explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has momentum, but the shift from reconstruction to burning lacks visceral escalation; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (porcelain's sharpness, warped light) create an oppressive, transformative atmosphere, though plant communication mechanics remain ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fracture as growth, fire as liberation) and layered subtext about narrative ownership elevate the story beyond plot into philosophical resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with inventive symbolism, though some phrases (e.g., "noble foolishness") risk abstraction; emotionally resonant through subtext, not explicit tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, though constrained word count leaves subtle character beats underdeveloped; lingers as an ode to transformation.</comment>
