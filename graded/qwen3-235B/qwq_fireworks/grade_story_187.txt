<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character traits are present but lack depth; motivation is implied but not fully explored. Stoicism informs actions but emotional layers remain superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure has clear progression but feels compressed; cause-and-effect is logical but key moments rushed, undermining full arc development within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (pulsing moss, hollow thud) create immersive atmosphere; some setting elements verge on genre tropes but serve tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (floorboard as void) and thematic cohesion around "necessary lies"; emotional resonance undercut by underdeveloped subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic phrasing; subverts "relic hunter" trope but relies on familiar fantasy staples (witches, eerie woods); metaphors are striking but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite constraints; theme of preserving fragile truths lingers. Word limit sacrifices character depth but enhances mythic tone.</comment>
