<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's grief and guilt are palpable, but "skeptical gambler" trait is underexplored and insufficiently drives actions beyond surface-level decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has emotional momentum but feels compressed, with underdeveloped cause-effect chains (e.g., sudden resolution of guiding lost travelers) marring coherence in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mycelium-lit farm creates striking atmosphere with vivid sensory details; tone shifts between frantic and peaceful are effective but occasionally uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story evokes visceral emotional response and uses strong symbolism (mycelium, petals), but subtext about grief-as-path lacks full thematic development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in setting but employs familiar "lost sister" trope; prose sometimes veers into poetic excess without sufficient emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but unevenly—some (farm/scrawls) integral, others (recipe testing) feel extraneous. Short form exposes structural gaps.</comment>
