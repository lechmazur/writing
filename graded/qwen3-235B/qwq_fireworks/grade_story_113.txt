<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's hesitancy is consistent but remains more symbolic than psychologically nuanced; motivation to mend sorrow ties to actions, but lacks complexity in emotional evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression through dreams with cause-effect logic, but dream transitions feel compressed and slightly disjointed under the word limit's constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich, surreal imagery (xenon glow, collapsing stars) creates haunting atmosphere, but inconsistent integration of time’s fragility as a tangible force weakens cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (tapestry, plush as relic of vulnerability) and cyclical structure elevate thematic depth, though emotional resonance is occasionally diluted by abstract symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unique blend of childlike whimsy (dinosaur plush) and cosmic melancholy avoids clichés, but some descriptors ("fractures in time") lean overly poetic, bordering on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements with a resonant theme of healing through vulnerability; constrained length occasionally glosses over narrative transitions but enhances thematic focus.</comment>
