<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Symbolic gestures outweigh psychological depth; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through nuanced motivation or consistent behavioral logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes metaphor over coherence; pivotal moments lack narrative weight due to compressed pacing and underdeveloped cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details construct a mythic atmosphere, but cultural specifics of the Indian temple setting remain stereotypical and disconnected from protagonist's identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thematic resonance in the union of form and content (cracked blotters/constellations as metaphors for rigid control) elevated by poetic imagery, though undercut by didactic ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Archetypal pattern (deal with shadowy figure, shattering relic) relies on mystical trope recycling; symbolic elements feel over-familiar rather than freshly interrogated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh execution; ambitious synthesis of existential themes and genre elements collapses under word-limit constraints, resulting in conceptual scaffolding rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
