<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character is well-motivated, actions align with traits. "Guarded" aspect could be deeper, but motivation/rebellion feels cohesive across timeline.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plotted with precision under constraints. Begins with artifact discovery, ends with legacy. Pacing tight, logical causality maintained despite complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly rendered (bioluminescence, trembling light) but some setting elements (nano-forest cores) underexploited. Sensory details immersive but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resonant metaphor (music as weapon), thematic clarity (erasure vs. memory), emotionally charged ending. Subtext of intergenerational defiance amplifies impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through technological-organic fusion. Emotional beats emerge from action, not exposition. Stylistically distinct without purple prose; subverts "rebel vs. council" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock precisely (bookmark as symbol of resilience). Compact form feels essential, not imposed. Leaves reader contemplating historical memory as living force.</comment>
