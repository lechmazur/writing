<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; his somber troubadour persona informs actions but lacks psychological nuance or emotional depth beyond surface-level grief and determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through stanzas as clues, but the final stanza appearing "in his mind" feels unearned; the curse-breaking conclusion is emotionally satisfying but slightly rushed within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned rocket site is visceral and evocative with decay-as-metaphor; sensory details (humming tension, flaking tarnish) effectively mirror thematic duality of ruin and renewal, though timeframe transformation remains abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (ring as control/key, torpedo as empathy's trajectory) resonate powerfully; lyrical prose balances specificity and mystery; theme of empathy's cyclical abuse/redemption lingers emotionally and intellectually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps with unique stanzas/tablecloth method; some phrases verge on purple prose ("hushed euphoria"), but the central conceit of weaponized empathy feels freshly subversive rather than AI-generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements cohesively orbit the curse-breaking arc; brevity enhances mythic tone rather than limiting it; interweaving of cosmic/nuclear decay with intimate family trauma demonstrates narrative economy.</comment>
