<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict; motivation stated but not deeply interrogated. Boots as tactile link to the past offers limited psychological insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Efficient use of terminal hologram exposition. Rushed vault discovery undermines tension; scuff patterns as recurring motif provide structural cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mildew/ambition olfactory contrast and celestial holograms create immersive decay. The boots' grime tracing historical pathways adds tactile dimensionality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant phrasing occasionally descends into ornamental excess ("bruised apple dawn"). Avoids genre tropes through fusion of science fantasy and archaeological mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric specificity compensates for compressed character arc. Boot scuff motif provides satisfying throughline that bridges individual and civilizational mortality.</comment>
