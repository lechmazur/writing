<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character embodies 'proudly humble' through actions and dialogue, but internal motivation tied to sister's heartbreak lacks deeper emotional excavation despite symbolic gestures. Consistency maintained, but lacks nuanced complexity for higher-tier character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from trapped psychic to savior via dice/diaries, but the transition from puzzle-solving to reactor manipulation feels slightly contrived. Pacing strained by condensed scope, weakening causal clarity in pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie, symbolic details (shadow family trees, spectral bells) create haunting immediacy, but bullet trains in deep-space setting remain unconvincing. Tone/setting integration succeeds atmospherically but falters logically in worldbuilding cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memorable imagery (dice as fate-anchors, diaries as ancestral threads) elevates the narrative, but thematic delivery leans on surface-level existential platitudes rather than subtextual richness. Irony of choice vs. destiny well-sketched but thinly elaborated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Unique fusion of genealogical mysticism and space piracy avoids genre clichés, with inventive use of mundane objects (dice, train diaries) as metaphysical tools. Some uneven phrasing ('bullet train passenger’s account of a dying star') betrays conceptual tension between terrestrial and cosmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative hangs together cohesively despite multiplicity of assigned elements, though 'bullet trains' and 'space pirates' strain suspension of disbelief. Brevity is both a strength (conceptual daring) and weakness (underdeveloped emotional stakes).</comment>
