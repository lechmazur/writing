<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits influence actions (leaf collection informs map quest) but lack psychological depth; motivation feels archetypal rather than personally urgent or conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from retrieval to revelation, but the rushed collapse/apotheosis sequence weakens the arc; cause-effect between phantom touch and seed rebirth needs further contextualization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral aquatic sensory immersion (sludge textures, algae light) masterfully builds decayed grandeur; the multiverse concept remains under-embodied in setting details beyond leaf symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors about living trade routes offer conceptual richness; occasional overwritten phrases ("infinite possibilities pressing against lungs") undermine subtlety; ending's thematic resonance about stewardship is affectingly bittersweet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phantom hand feels trope-heavy despite atmospheric execution; multiverse references lack distinctive mechanics that might prevent generic cosmicism; leaf collection concept shows ingenuity but occasionally veers into ornamental cataloguing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into purposeful whole but uneven integration - underwater location feels underexploited while leaf-as-memory device elevates multiple aspects; prose achieves moments of brilliance amid slight structural hollowness.</comment>
