<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Boastful warrior lacks psychological depth; motivations shift between defiance and desperation without sufficient grounding in his established traits. The transformation into a "nest architect" feels abrupt despite surface consistency with initial boastfulness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Non-linear structure prioritizes surreal momentum over conventional coherence. Balloon pops as rhythmic narrative beats create tension, while the ending's philosophical ambiguity undermines closure despite tight thematic bookends.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (pulsing latex, citrus dread) create oppressive atmosphere, but the wasp's nest logic oscillates between biological grotesquerie and abstract existentialism, causing tonal whiplash. Atmosphere dominates substance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphors for self-deception and reality construction resonate, but emotional impact diluted by excessive surrealism. Conceptual depth undermined by rushed dissolution ending that feels like thematic evasion rather than resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through bizarre hybridization (warrior-meets-Cronenberg-esque surrealism) but contains moments of overwrought description ("lint-strewn pocket" repetition) and slightly formulaic existential revelations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor compensates for strained element integration. The wasp/reality themes bind disparate elements, but certain details (precise madness tone, lint symbolism) feel imposed rather than organically developed within the tight structure.</comment>
