<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but inner conflict lacks depth; "sharp gentleness" feels underexplored despite coherent actions. Emotional resonance weakened by abstract introspection over experiential demonstration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by mechanism alignment, but prophetic resolution feels hurried despite logical cause-effect; structural cohesion achieved within constraints, undermined by compressed emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae creates hypnotic atmosphere; seashell-mansion parallelism enhances thematic weight, though tactile sensory details remain sparse beneath vivid visuals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (puzzle-box cityscape, reversed wishes) deliver thematic heft; accidental heroism resonates through paradoxical action, elevated by lyrical yet precise prose that lingers thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>No formulaic tropes; "shutter’s final snap" and seashell’s pulse avoid clichés; emotional nuance emerges through symbolic objects rather than direct telling; controlled tonal consistency maintained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements harmonize toward existential resolution; brevity serves thematic compression; ending’s emotional ambivalence suggests depth exceeding spatial limits while maintaining narrative completeness.</comment>
