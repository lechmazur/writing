<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is defined by tactile aversion/conversion arc, but emotional nuance feels constrained by brevity; the "deep-seated prejudice" against valuing touch never fully transcends surface exposition into embodied behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compact three-act structure works within word limits, though the Vrynn encounter's metaphysical implications emerge abruptly; award ceremony framing provides cohesion, but the decay-to-speech transition strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie spaceport aesthetics shine with synesthetic details ("synthetic warmth," "molten copper skin"), but worldbuilding falters in underdeveloped interspecies dynamics; ancient novelty tone oscillates between poetic and half-realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (ticket punch as ancestral memory, starlight orbs as emotional residue) elevates thematic resonance; ending's crowd reaction risks sentimentality but avoids full saccharinity through visceral physical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids AI predictability through hybrid-genre fusion (tech-infused bodywork + post-transportation decay), though "healers merging touch with starlight" flirts with mystical trope recycling; voice maintains specificity despite occasional conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully interwoven rather than checklist-driven, yet emotional payoff remains modest for its lofty conceptual ambitions; the brevity works as thematic condensation but leaves character transformation feeling somewhat schematic.</comment>
