<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but underdeveloped; the brewer's obsession with analog relics lacks psychological depth. Dialogue feels cryptic rather than revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc but relies too heavily on sudden, unexplained transitions (girl's appearance, tent collapse) that undermine coherence in the compressed format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is extraordinaryâ€”burnt caramel, pixelated moonlight, and feral elegance create a haunting analog-digital hybrid that permeates every sensory element.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but occasionally indulges in dense metaphor clusters that strain for "poetic" effect. Blending circus decay with cyberpunk elements feels fresh but unevenly sustained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere visually but lack thematic density. The tight format sacrifices character interiority and logical plotting in favor of striking images that linger.</comment>
