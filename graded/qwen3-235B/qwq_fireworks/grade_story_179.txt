<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ruler's crack influences decisions but psychological nuance lacks full conviction. Transition from envy to surrender feels abbreviated despite symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Microscopic fingerprint patterns provide structural ingenuity but plot progression relies on abstract conceptual shifts rather than concrete narrative momentum within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Beehive's chromatic dynamics and humming claustrophobia create immersive, metaphorically rich environment that breathes with the tension between order and artistic expression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose achieves poetic cohesion; the erosion of envy into collective creation carries subtextual universality. Pacing occasionally sacrifices visceral emotional immediacy for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original conceits (fingerprint cartography, pigment alchemy) avoid genre traps. Some descriptive flourishes risk ornamental excess without descending into full "purple prose" territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Precisely calibrated symbolic architecture demonstrates editorial readiness. Thematic unification of elements occasionally prioritizes allegorical clarity over organic character psychology.</comment>
