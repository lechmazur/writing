<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters show depth through actions and dialogue but 'softly militant' trait underdeveloped. Mira’s emotional arc compressed yet credible. Elias’s mother’s influence effective but underutilized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compact structure with clear beginning/middle/end progression. Fracture’s discovery, seed-bomb solution, and cosmic healing logically connected. Pacing tight but cohesive within constraints; rift closure somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, decayed setting (ivy-choked concrete, smogged skies) evokes visceral decay. Sensorial details like 'hydroponic pipes' and 'spyglass gleaming' anchor the world. Cosmic imagery risks overabstraction but balances with tactile decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (gardener’s puzzle, star’s skeleton) deepen theme. Emotional resonance through symbolic actions (seeds spiraling like embers) rather than exposition. Ending’s 'earth’s sigh' delivers poetic closure. Dialogue sparse but pointed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through cosmic/ecological fusion. Some adjectives ('trembled,' 'brittle') verge on abstract but generally restrained. Conceptual risks (cosmic balance as chorus) feel fresh rather than algorithmic. Mira’s arc occasionally formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematic whole. Tight interplay between ruin and rebirth motifs. Word count pressures character depth but enhances urgency. Ending lingers as thematic revelation rather than narrative surprise.</comment>
