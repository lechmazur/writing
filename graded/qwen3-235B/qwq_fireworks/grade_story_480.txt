<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth—social media exorcist role is underexplored, motivations feel superficially stated rather than dramatized through action. Mara’s indifference/enthusiasm duality remains thematically vague.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but compressed; cause/effect between receipt discovery and ghost exorcism works, though setup feels rushed. Circular structure satisfies within constraints but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mood is viscerally immersive—neon decay, tactile shadows, and analog-digital dissonance enhance tone. Atmospheric consistency falters slightly when blending hauntology with modern tech tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (e.g., “pixelated tears,” “buffering video”) impress but lack thematic resonance. Ending’s cyclical intrigue hints at theme of endless searching but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tropes reworked (digital ghosts, exorcism-as-data) show ingenuity, but execution borders on pastiche. Dialogue/names (gap-toothed bartender, trench-coated man) lean on noir clichés without subverting them decisively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional mystery, but length strains thematic depth. The “raw edge” concept resonates, though its exploration feels truncated rather than purposeful.</comment>
