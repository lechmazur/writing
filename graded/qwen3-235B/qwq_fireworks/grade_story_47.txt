<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations around solving father's obsessions are clear, but limited emotional depth prevents full immersion. The 'eagerly jaded' trait is inconsistently portrayed through fragmented interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Trials form coherent scaffolding but pacing wavers in midsection. The ending feels abrupt despite thematic connection to father's notes, undermining complete narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary's oppressive silence is masterfully rendered through tactile details (sweating glove, vibrating phones) and visual grotesquerie (shattered mirrors, bleeding walls).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical layering (scars as maps, laughter as rebellion) elevates impact. Ending's catharsis feels earned despite occasional overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Refreshing subversion of 'solving' tropes through destructive revelation, but contains occasional purple prose ("fractured urgency"). Emotional resonance prioritizes concept over nuanced character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere compellingly despite brevity constraints. The symbolic significance of laughter as climax feels innovative though thematic connections during middle sections could be stronger.</comment>
