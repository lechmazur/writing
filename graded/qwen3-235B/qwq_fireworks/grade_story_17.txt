<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character is deeply motivated by guilt, driving credible actions. Transformation through confronting her past feels earned despite brevity, though her professional skillset lacks detailed integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tight structure with mirror-image beginning/end. The inciting chip in the bowl directly leads to its healing, creating satisfying circularity within compressed wordcount. Few unnecessary elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie Necropolis setting and occult workshop create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere. Sensory details like burning sage and shifting mist immerse readers without overwhelming narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poignant emotional subtext beneath procedural surface. Metaphors (mending bowl as self-renewal) work beautifully. Ending avoids sentimentality while delivering thematic payoff about iterative self-forgiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique premise (black-market genealogist). Some phrases ("whispering flames") border on clich√©, but generally restrained lyricism. Emotional nuance shown through tangible objects rather than direct explication.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion of guilt/redemption transcends assigned elements. Stylistic rhythm balances poetic resonance with narrative urgency. Ending gesture toward ongoing change lingers memorably.</comment>
