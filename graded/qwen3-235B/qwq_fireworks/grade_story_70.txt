<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's rigidity and intellectual detachment are well-established, but her emotional transformation feels compressed, lacking visceral grounding in her professional history. The "arms of steel" metaphor is literalized awkwardly, diluting psychological resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from bulb investigation to epiphany, but the witch's exposition-heavy dialogue disrupts momentum. The grave visitations create satisfying circularity yet sacrifice depth in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse setting is atmospheric and symbolic, with strong sensory details (e.g., "tongues of rust"), but the grave hill's significance feels underexploited—how does it interact with the bulb's magic?</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphors ("ledger with liberated wings") and thematic coherence prevail. The healing light as emotional reckoning resonates without over-explanation, though occasional ornate phrasing risks losing impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original combination of Tesla lore and graveyard mysticism avoids genre clichés. Emotional progression feels earned rather than algorithmic, though "moss-thick voice" borders on contrived imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around a cohesive thesis: the story's microcosm of emotional growth feels intentional. The bulb-as-antidote-to-rigidity concept lingers, though broader implications remain underdeveloped.</comment>
