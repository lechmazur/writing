<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's uncertainty is visually shown through actions but lacks deeper emotional nuance; dialogue with the giant feels archetypal rather than distinct. The empty purse reveals resolve but motivation remains half-abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc through the labyrinth, but pacing stumbles during the giant confrontation; cause-effect logic holds despite tight word limits, though the resolution feels slightly condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually dense atmosphere with rust, brittle parchment, and crumbling walls immerses the reader; the workshop’s decay directly shapes the archivist’s quest and the theme of fractured beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (purse, labyrinth) and subtext about breaking precedents resonate, but the ending’s "spark catching" feels melodramatic; writing style elevates the narrative unevenly, with occasional overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth and workshop avoid clichés but blend familiar fantasy archetypes; prose leans on ornate descriptions in weaker moments, and emotional beats rely partly on explicit declarations rather than subtext.</comment>
