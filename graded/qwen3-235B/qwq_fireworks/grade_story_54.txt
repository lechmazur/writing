<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Consistent motivation and attribute alignment, but emotional depth feels surface-level; internal conflict lacks nuance beyond stated regrets and sensory triggers like the scarf.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear progression from evasion to offloading, but cause-effect relationships (e.g., vibration sensing’s role in resolution) lack development; pacing occasionally rushed despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative carnival decay and star motifs enrich setting, but sensory details unevenly distributed (e.g., negligible tactile descriptions of temperature or weight).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stellar imagery and symbolic use of constellations elevate the theme of preservation vs. legacy, but subtext remains underexplored; ending feels poetically inevitable but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive integration of constellation navigation and hunting runes avoids genre clichés, but vibrations of intent verge on supernatural convenience; prose occasionally indulges in ornamental phrasing (“elegant chaos” as descriptor).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a tense, thematically unified whole; the constrained form serves the narrative’s urgency without feeling restrictive, though thematic ambition slightly outpaces execution.</comment>
