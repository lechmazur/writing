<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (grief) drives the plot, but "spy" aspect feels underdeveloped. Emotional numbness manifests through action but lacks interiority beyond surface descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but feels rushed - the avalanche's rerouting lacks technical specifics despite emotional weight. The beginning/end connection works but requires reader inference.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory overload through holograms, ozone, and bioluminescence creates immersive cyberpunk gloom. The setting actively shapes character decisions and thematic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of avalanche metaphor and label symbolism. Ending's catharsis works, but the final "anthem" line risks melodrama. Subtext about manipulated systems resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through fractured memory imagery and corporate dystopia. Some AI-pattern phrasing ("metallic tang, new recipe of betrayal") slightly clunky, but overall fresh tonal balance between nihilism and hope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly despite word limit. Timeframe constraint (tasting moment) feels artificial, but most components - particularly label/avalanche interplay - demonstrate inventive narrative engineering.</comment>
