<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character possesses distinct contradictions (reserved yet manipulative) and clear motivation, but internal conflict could be more explicitly dramatized through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight cause-effect chain with clever integration of key elements, but the quantum mechanics conceit occasionally strains internal logic at critical narrative junctures.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive through precise sensory details and metaphoric cohesion; the quantum entanglement garden's atmosphere flawlessly amplifies both theme and tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolic layering and philosophical contemplation elevate the narrative; some thematic subtleties risk being overshadowed by dense imagery overload.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original concept execution with fresh metaphors (quantum moss threads, moth-wing decoys), but contains occasional archaic descriptors that feel formulaic rather than authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Highly conceptual story maintains cohesion while embedding assigned elements organically, though the ending's neat resolution slightly undercuts the moral complexity established earlier.</comment>
