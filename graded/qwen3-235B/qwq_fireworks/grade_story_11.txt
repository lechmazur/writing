<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Flightiness as a character trait shapes mapping actions but lacks emotional depth; motivation to leave legacy drives plot but is resolved too tidily without psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Hidden map discoveries drive plot effectively but the vault discovery feels compressed; pacing balances mystery with urgency but resolution lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gaslight atmosphere effectively contrasts with "strangely normal" hall; sensory details like grease textures and compass weight ground the surreal elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (unity as "flicker," rebellion "in stasis") create thematic resonance; ending feels both earned and haunting, though emotional impact is somewhat muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic mystery tropes through cartographic perspective; metaphors feel fresh but some phrasing ("quiet laugh") leans generic; tension between conformity and defiance feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Beneath the surface intrigue lies themes of institutional deception and legacy; tightly integrated elements amplify mystery without feeling contrived.</comment>
