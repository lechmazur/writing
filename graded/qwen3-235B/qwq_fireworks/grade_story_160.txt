<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivation are hinted but underexplored; lacks emotional depth and personal stakes to justify actions beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has momentum and thematic closure but relies on abrupt leaps (e.g., tree growth) that strain coherence within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Enriching atmosphere through tactile details (rusted gates, iridescent sand) and contrasting decay/nature motifs amplify tone and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors are striking (goggles as memory, sand as rebellion), but emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh integration of steampunk and environmental themes avoids tropes, but occasional flowery descriptors (e.g., "language of roots") border on artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully woven but occasionally strained; the storyâ€™s ambition outpaces the space, leaving gaps in character logic.</comment>
