<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s morbid trade and "tempered beliefs" drive her arc, but motivation shifts abruptly without emotional scaffolding; her transformation feels conceptually driven over psychologically convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Candle’s countdown anchors tension; plot moves from discovery to revelation logically, but the word limit strains the transition from skeptic to cosmic epiphany, leaving arc feeling rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dojo’s floating rock and dying lantern merge with themes via visceral details—salt/ink scents, skeletal shadows—crafting a mythic, cohesive microcosm.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose weds metaphor ("funeral shears prune eternity") to existential inquiry; ending subverts mourning as stasis, demanding active rebirth. Resolution resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mixes fresh cosmic allegory (dojo as "petal of celestial bloom") with minor lapses into lyrical abstraction; avoids clichés but leans on ethereal vagueness over concrete emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements (candle’s time limit, cosmic texts) interlock to service theme over spectacle; brevity risks underdeveloped transitions, but overall cohesion and lingering metaphysical resonance justify structure.</comment>
