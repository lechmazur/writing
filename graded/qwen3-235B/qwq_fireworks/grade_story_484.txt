<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character driven by vague inherited values but lacks emotional depth; motivations hinted but not fully explored. Actions sometimes feel arbitrary without strong internal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic structure but lacks clear stakes; connection between initiating and resolving conflict feels abstract. Pacing uneven in mid-section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually haunting atmosphere with rich sensory details; setting functions as active character. Darkening walls and blurred tombstones enhance thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolic elements (mirror shard as both weapon and sacrifice) creates layered meaning. Ending achieves thematic resonance but sacrifices emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies on haunted mansion tropes with superficial subversion; some poetic phrasing but contains repetitive descriptions of darkness. Avoids overt purple prose yet feels derivative in places.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Successfully weaves assigned elements into gothic framework but struggles with emotional grounding. Leaves conceptual impression without achieving lasting visceral impact.</comment>
