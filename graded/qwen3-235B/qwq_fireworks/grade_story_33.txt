<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated but underexplored; the character's internal logic and trait connections remain surface-level, particularly the tension between nonviolence and wielding chaotic power.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels constrained by word limit; cosmic blink’s stakes aren’t fully grounded, and cause/effect between mask and resolution lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric cohesion; the office’s sterile beauty and spectral contrasts create a haunting mood that enhances thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with rich symbolism (mask, leaves, reflections) and resonant themes; some abstract passages dilute emotional impact slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Fresh, subversive approach to "nonviolence" and cosmic conflict; metaphors feel original, and the fusion of bureaucratic order with mystical rebellion avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Most elements serve the story well, though a few (e.g., "kilter") feel conceptually strained; the ending lingers, but the premise’s ambition occasionally outpaces execution.</comment>
