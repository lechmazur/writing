<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but inner conflict remains underexplored. Shyness as a trait isn't consistently manifested in her actions or narrative voice until the final revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying arc but pacing falters during the abrupt tearing-of-photo climax. Underwater market logic creates engaging middle section but transitions between timelines lack full cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with coral vendors and dissolving languages creates immersive atmosphere. Underwater elements tie to cosmic imbalance thematically but timeframes remain vaguely integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (regret as photographs, choice as tearing) are potent. Ending achieves emotional resonance through subtext rather than exposition. Subtle showing of themes elevates storytelling craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structure through combining social media with cosmic concepts. Some potentially purple prose ("whispering fragments of timelines") balanced by fresh imagery like kelp-paved crossroads. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but slight mechanical feel to assigned components. Brief length enhances tension but sacrifices deeper exploration of parallel timelines. Lingering thematic resonance compensates for minor contrivances.</comment>
