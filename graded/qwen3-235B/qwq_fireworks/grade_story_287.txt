<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (solar cycles, unanswered question) consistent but underexplored; torn visionary aspect feels surface-level compared to depth of obsession shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot hinges on shared book as method but transition from conflict to collaboration feels rushed; ending satisfies but sacrifices emotional weight for thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (vines, rust) evoke decay but overly reliant on "catacombs" as shorthand rather than specific, layered sensory immersion; tone leans into "wildness" at cost of subtlety.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subtext of cyclical knowledge gaps as language elevates narrative; emotional resonance uneven (childâ€™s question payoff diluted by rapid closure).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>1920 cellphone as archaic tech is inventive; avoids cliche through functional integration with solar data. Some phrases ("careful wildness") borderline ornate but mostly purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>All elements service a tightly-conceived speculative framework but fusion of archaic tech and cyclical astronomy occasionally strains plausibility; brevity amplifies thematic focus at cost of character depth.</comment>
