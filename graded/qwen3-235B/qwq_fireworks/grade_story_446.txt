<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (restoring kingdom), but "amiable gambler" trait underdeveloped. The mild obsession drives actions but lacks emotional nuance. The ledger interaction reveals intellectual fixation, but "peaceful anger" remains mostly stated rather than shown through specific behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hydrolysis ritual drives plot decisively. Connection between opening ledger at party and kingdom's reappearance feels cohesive. Pacing balances backstory with climax efficiently despite word count. Concept shapes plot through ritual timing, but charity drive framework feels slightly peripheral to core action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Firefly breeding grounds create vivid magical atmosphere through bioluminescent imagery and primal energy. The charity gala setting contrasts nicely with mystical purpose. Sensory details (shimmering wings, champagne, petal residue) immerse effectively. Timeframe integrates throughout rather than feeling imposed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors of petals and unbecoming convey theme of transformative release. The ending's duality of old/new firefly paths offers poetic resonance. Subtext of theft vs restoration adds depth. Shows through ritual details more than tells, though some emotional descriptions ("peaceful anger") remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic pitfalls but occasionally slips into mystical clichés ("kingdom's shadow flicker"). Sensory details specific rather than generic. The "art of unbecoming" concept itself is original, but the restoration of lost kingdom trope lacks subversion. No明显 AI artifacts or abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively despite density - ledger, fireflies, petal method all interconnect purposefully. Brief format feels deliberate, with self-contained arc. Leaves lingering questions about kingdom's future rather than simple resolution. Style maintains clarity despite lyrical prose.</comment>
