<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (dealing with mother's legacy/burden) is clear and consistent with actions, but the emotional evolution from Ruthlessness to vulnerability feels slightly rushed within 500 words. Mara's distinct voice shines through floral metaphors and abrupt dialogue but lacks full dimensional arcs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure moves efficiently from floral shop to stone circle, but the resolution (instantly decoding carvings with Eli) strains credibility. Logical cause-effect for key moments exists but could use tighter pacing. Beginning/middle/end coherence holds despite constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (slick rain on stones, cracked radio voice, comb's tactile imperfections) create a haunting atmosphere. The mysterious tone complements both the "watcher's burden" and decoding mission seamlessly, though timeframes could integrate better.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (comb as both bridge/failure, stones as coded language) elevates text. Ending resonates emotionally through understated "pause between verses" metaphor. Shows tension through Mara's internal conflict expertly without oversimplifying themes of control vs. collaboration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clichés—metaphors are fresh (scalpel's precision ≠ generic "sharpness"), emotions shown through objects/actions. Dialogue avoids stiffness. Mild overuse of thematic repetition ("notches," "spontaneity") slightly detracts but maintains human nuance overall.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements work together impressively (comb connects personal/folkloric mysteries), but brief length strains complexity. Left wanting deeper exploration of mother's backstory or spiral symbolism. Lingering thought about silence/music as language is potent yet somewhat underdeveloped.</comment>
