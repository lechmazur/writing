<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent blending of logic-driven traits with emotional epiphanies weakens character cohesion. The oracle's voice reveals internal conflict but lacks nuanced evolution from "fact-minded" to emotionally aware.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression through symbolic settings achieves coherence but feels compressed. Heartbreak visions as plot drivers and the mirrored beginning/end at the door create structure, while the "path of empathy" resolution risks abruptness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich metaphors like weeping books and unstable dimensions immerse readers, though haptic descriptions (compass texture, emotional weight of the scarf) anchor abstract concepts more effectively than visual motifs alone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolic transformation of the compass into a key and the final room of "recomposed heartbreaks" elevate thematic depth. Over-reliance on explicit "stop counting, start feeling" conclusion slightly diminishes nuanced impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through original imagery (e.g., dimension-shaking libraries) but occasionally resorts to predictable "cold=emotionless" tropes. Emotional subtext is shown through metaphor but occasionally undercut by overt declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully interwoven but occasionally strained by thematic weight. The concise form serves the transformation arc, though the ending’s simplicity may oversimplify complex ideas about logic vs. empathy.</comment>
