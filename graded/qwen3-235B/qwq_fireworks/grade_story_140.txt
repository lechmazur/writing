<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (survivor's guilt, redemption), but emotional depth feels surface-level. Internal conflict shown through action rather than subtle nuance. Distinct voice established but underexplored in interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc despite constraints. Pacing is efficient, with logical cause-effect (doll → portal → transformation). Concept shapes direction organically. Some abruptness in planetarium projector's significance, but cohesion maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through specific details (mothballs, cracked mirrors, glowing constellations). Atmosphere deeply intertwined with character psychology. Timeframe enhances thematic resonance through dawn's transitional symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotional impact derives from layered metaphors (doll as trauma, constellations as legacy). Ending feels earned and thematic (transformation vs. denial). Subtext about guardianship and legacy adds depth. Overuse of "playful seriousness" contrast weakens final line's weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subverts "haunted doll" trope with cosmic horror and guardian lineage elements. Some purple prose in early descriptions, but stylistic choices align with Gothic tone. Emotional resonance through symbolism rather than exposition. Minor predictability in redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements integrated cohesively. Brevity serves mythic tone rather than limiting. Unique synthesis of circus horror, cosmic forces, and familial legacy creates lingering resonance. Thematic focus on confronting denial unifies narrative.</comment>
