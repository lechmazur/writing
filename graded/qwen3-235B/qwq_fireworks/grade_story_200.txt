<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is implied through actions but lacks explicit psychological depth; internal conflict drives the narrative but feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plotted with precision in word constraints, though the transition from sabotage to phoenix emergence risks abruptness despite strong narrative thread.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory mastery: atmosphere of decay and rebirth is immersive through tactile details (vibrating molars, liquid mercury light) and symbolic setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (mosaic as motivation; phoenix as theme) creates layered meaning, though ending risks slight over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with fresh imagery (compass screaming north) and thematic subtext, though faint AI-like repetition in rhythm descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion despite required constraints; tone and theme harmonize tightly, with some minor pacing hiccups.</comment>
