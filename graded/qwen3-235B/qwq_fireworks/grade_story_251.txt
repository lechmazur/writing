<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's ambivalence and 'bashful arrogance' are evident but motivations (why scramble scoreboard?) remain underexplored, weakening psychological depth under exacting standards.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression through puzzle assembly works logically but pacing falters in mid-section; abrupt transition to vacuum drifting feels mechanically contrived despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moon dust, rocket fuel stench, and whining recyclers create visceral atmosphere. 'Between heartbeats' temporal motif masterfully amplifies claustrophobic tension within constrained setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but structural ambition exceeds word-count capacity - feels like excerpt from larger work rather than self-contained story with deliberate brevity.</comment>
