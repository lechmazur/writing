<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Main character's "slyness" underexplored; motivation to archive folklore drives plot but personal stakes feel underdeveloped. Family tradition referenced but doesn't deeply influence choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ritual action drives plot but pacing feels rushed during guardian interaction. Clear beginning-to-end arc (arrival to resolution) within word limit, though cause-effect connections between bumper car activation and folklore revival could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting vividly rendered through specific sensory details (rust, cotton candy scent, creaking chains). Atmosphere directly supports folkloric theme and emotional tenor of loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (fork as preservation key), haunting imagery, and thematic subtext about collective memory. Ending balances melancholy with hope, avoiding sentimentality. Dialogue sparse but evocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through blending family legacy with ritual folklore. Some phrases ("desperate optimism") feel stated rather than shown. Guardian character tropish but effective in context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrated thematically rather than mechanically. Tight word constraint managed well, with emotional resonance extending beyond closed carnival's history.</comment>
