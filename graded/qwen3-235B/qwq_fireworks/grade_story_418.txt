<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prominent character transformation through physical and emotional changes, but motivation consistency and internal logic could be more rigorously developed, occasionally veering into abstraction rather than grounded emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing unevenness in exposition/conclusion transition and somewhat accelerated emotional payoff weaken narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere with multi-sensory decay-and-rebirth motif; radiation-glitter connection and melancholic hopefulness create potent dissonance that elevates the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</comment>Symbolism-rich prose with resonant metaphors (glass-box-as-failed-ambition, glitter-as-residue-of-lies) creates thematic depth; occasional overreliance on adjectival mood-setting slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through magical-realist gender alchemy twist and post-apocalyptic botanical motifs; some phrases ("whispering promises," "bitter sweet ache") verge on familiar poetic cadences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong integration of form and content creates memorable archetype; occasional lyrical excesses threaten coherence, but overall achieves a self-contained mythic quality that transcends length limitations.</comment>
