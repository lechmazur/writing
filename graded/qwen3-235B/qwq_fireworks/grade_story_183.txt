<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's restlessness defines her motion but lacks personal stakes beyond abstract quest; motivations are concept-driven rather than emotionally tangible. Voice remains abstracted from lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean mythic structure within limitations; transitions between reality and rift feel abrupt but thematically justified. Resolution integrates key elements without redundancy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mosaic tiles as liminal gateway and theatre’s transformation create symbiotic decay/beauty; sensory details (humming stone, spectral sounds) immerse without overloading. Rift’s silence-as-landscape amplifies tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose wields paradox as both theme and technique; final revelation (“ordinary miracle”) anchors abstract ideas in emotional resonance. Subtext of grief-as-compassion lingers unspoken.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tics but occasionally slips into generic “mystical” phrasing (“whispering tiles,” “kaleidoscope rift”). Metaphors like “liquid starlight” feel fresh, but emotional architecture leans on archetypal tropes without deepening them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere through tonal unity over strict plot logic; word economy sacrifices secondary character development but serves thematic clarity. Lingers as poem rather than narrative, which feels intentional.</comment>
