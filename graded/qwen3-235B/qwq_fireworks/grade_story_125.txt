<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's shift from underachiever to reborn mage is clear but lacks nuanced internal struggle; motivation driven more by plot convenience than deep personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight structure but feels slightly rushed; cause-and-effect progression is logical, yet the abrupt transformation of the protagonist strains believability within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective sensory details create a haunting atmosphere; the abandoned station’s decay and the eerie doll enhance mood, though deeper immersion in the farmland’s encroachment is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolism with the doll and globe; ending ties to theme of heritage but relies on exposition; dialogue feels purposeful yet lacks layered subtext; tension is resolved too neatly for the stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi and magic inventively; avoids overused tropes but occasionally leans on familiar "chosen one" narrative; prose is vivid without excess ornamentation, though some emotional reactions are told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically clear but lacks lingering resonance; brevity serves the plot yet restricts deeper exploration of character and worldbuilding.</comment>
