<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (disarming cynicism) and consistent with traits, but the "unruly" aspect lacks deeper integration beyond physical descriptors. Voice remains distinct but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with the light show as central action, but the "between innings" timeframe feels underutilized. Pacing is efficient but lacks tension to anchor the 400-500 word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends alchemy and science effectively (e.g., "hauntingly cheerful" laughter vs. "serious faces"). Sensory details like shimmering light and projector hum are evocative but sparse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of science/magic duality and rediscovering wonder resonate. Ending is satisfying but feels conclusively tidy rather than provocatively ambiguous. Writing style balances lyricism with clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids common tropes (e.g., the cracked lens as intentional imperfection). Some phrases ("hauntingly cheerful") are fresh, though occasional florid description ("playful wonder") borders on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Elements (projector, cracked lens, cynic-disarming motive) fit cohesively. The tight word limit feels purposeful, but the ending leans slightly on emotional telling rather than showing.</grade>
