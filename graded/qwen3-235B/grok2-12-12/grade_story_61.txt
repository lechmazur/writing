<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's timidity and boldness inconsistently revealed through minimal action; motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; key action (hurling chimes) drives the story but cause-effect lacks depth due to tight constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Creative setting contrasts with occasional overwrought phrasing (e.g., "specters of doubt") and predictable emotional beats that undermine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack integration; storyâ€™s brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with underexplored thematic potential.</comment>
