<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stunt double lacks concrete phobias or believable motivations; actions feel disconnected from his profession and fear of madness. Dialogue/voice absent, undermining character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from envelope to triumph, but the pyramid journey and knot-unraveling lack narrative weight; pacing feels compressed rather than cohesive. The arc is complete but insufficiently earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague descriptors ("mundanely spiritual") and clichéd Egyptian tropes; minimal sensory immersion. The pyramid library feels generic, disconnected from garage-sale origins.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Surface-level symbolism (net = fear); ending leans on tell-over-show exposition. Fails to evoke genuine emotional resonance or subvert clichés like "dance on the edge of madness."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Riddled with genre tropes (forgotten library, hero’s journey) and overly abstract metaphors; repetitive phrases ("echoes in the dark," "mundanely spiritual") suggest formulaic writing. Uninspired language weakens authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements like the envelope and net feel arbitrarily assembled; short form exacerbates disjointed transitions. Theme of fear-conquest lacks nuance or lingering impact despite ambitious premise.</comment>
