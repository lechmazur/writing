<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but superficial; actions align with stated goals but lack psychological depth or nuanced realization of "intimate separation."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear structure with beginning-middle-end framework, but underdeveloped progression; cause-effect between coin tosses and simulated reality dissolution remains abstract and unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Potential-laden atmosphere undermined by sparse sensory detail; "ghost town at dawn" evokes mood without concrete tactile/visceral realization like decayed wood smells, crunching gravel, or temperature shifts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (melodies as liberation keys) suggest thematic ambition, but emotional resonance remains conceptual rather than visceral; conclusion resolves too neatly without earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Concepts like coin-toss melodies show ingenuity undercut by clich√©d "simulated reality" framing; purple prose ("weight of remembering") and predictable emotional signposts dilute authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements forcibly assembled rather than organically integrated; story feels structurally serviceable rather than revelatory of deeper human truths or formal innovation.</comment>
