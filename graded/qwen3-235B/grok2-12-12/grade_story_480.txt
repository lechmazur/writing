<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but superficial; the "indifferent enthusiasm" lacks emotional depth. The social media exorcist persona isn't fully leveraged to explore contradictions between modern digital culture and spiritual rituals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pacing is generally controlled despite word constraints, but the connection between reigniting the spirit and the mess hall's history feels rushed. The ritual climax is coherent but underdeveloped in terms of stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere is masterfully crafted through sensory details (flickering candles, faint music), though the timeframe ("after the final chord") is underutilized. The mess hall's decayed grandeur amplifies both mystery and melancholy effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thematic interest in memory vs. oblivion are undercut by passive characterization. The central conflict lacks urgency, and the ending feels more like closure than emotional resonance. Literary devices are competent but not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on Gothic tropes without subversion. "Quietly loud" and "familiar strangers" feel clich√©d rather than innovative. Prose occasionally veers into pretentiousness ("raw edge" without specificity). Emotional states are often labeled rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements (grocery receipt, mess hall) are cohesively deployed but serve more as aesthetic props than thematic anchors. The story hints at deeper ideas about preservation vs. decay but doesn't fully commit. Lingering questions about the spirit's unfinished business are left underexplored.</comment>
