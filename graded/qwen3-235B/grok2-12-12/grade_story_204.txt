<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to overcome prejudice is clear but underdeveloped; connection between "unusually usual" approach and specific actions lacks depth. Reactions to phantom ticket and astronaut encounter hint at growth but remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure ties beginning/end through speech framing device but transitions between backstory and present feel rushed. Farmer's market encounter and spaceport setting connection lacks narrative momentum. Pacing uneven within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport offers strong atmospheric potential poorly realized; "ancient novelty" tone inconsistently maintained. Sensory details minimal and generic. Atmospheric decay only superficially supports themes of human connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story evokes reflection on touch/loneliness through metaphor of space exploration and cuddling. Symbolism of phantom ticket and unspoken rules provide depth but message-heavy delivery undermines subtlety. Emotional resonance undercut by overly-expository narration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing but contains predictable phrases like "strange beauty." Farmer's market encounter feels contrived rather than organic. Sensory details occasionally vivid (hush before speech) but often generic. Tone shifts awkwardly between wistful and inspirational.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic purpose but integration feels forced rather than organic. Short form works for speech framing but backstory interruptions disrupt momentum. Conceptual ambition evident but uneven execution prevents cohesive whole.</comment>
