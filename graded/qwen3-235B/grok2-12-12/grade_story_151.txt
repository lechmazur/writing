<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, serving theme more than feeling human; motivation clear but underdeveloped beyond symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progression logical but rushed; symbolic resolution feels abrupt, though connects beginning and end despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (e.g., ice floes) lacks integration with character and plot; atmospheric details overwhelm over coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (snowflake, veil) bolster theme, but emotional resonance undercut by overt thematic telling rather than subtle subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by flowery abstractions ("rationally organic") and predictable redemption arc; some poetic phrasing feels formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but strain under scrutiny; themes hinted at but not fully earned within constraints; over-reliance on poetic vagueness.</comment>
