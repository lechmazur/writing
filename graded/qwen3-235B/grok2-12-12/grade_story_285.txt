<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivation feels imposed rather than organically tied to actions. Hermit crab symbolism is tacked on rather than revealing intrinsic traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Predictable "call to adventure" structure serves the word limit but sacrifices causal clarity. Resolution feels abrupt, with world-bridging mechanics handwaved rather than explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting elements don't cohere into a functional ecosystem. Thermal vents in tundra defy logic, sensory details prioritize style over substance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Postcard as narrative device shows promise but resolves too neatly. Hermit crab metaphor and fruit's power verge on trite mysticism rather than earned symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Uneven sentence rhythms oscillate between poetic abstraction and clunky exposition. Some original imagery (glowing fruit) diluted by clich√©d "weight of his task" phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story hangs together technically but lacks emotional resonance or thematic complexity. Ambiguous relationship between "traditional systems" and plot leaves narrative hollow.</comment>
