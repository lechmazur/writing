<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (science/wonder) is clear but underdeveloped; "guarded disclosures" remain superficially treated. Actions driven more by plot demands than psychological depth, though the trembling hands and journal connection provide brief glimpses of interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Puzzle sequence lacks causal logic (why these puzzles lead to the room); pacing feels artificially compressed. Dance lessons framing device disconnected from core narrative, undermining thematic contrast. Resolution via convenient journal feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting relies on gothic tropes with minimal sensory specificity. Psychic facility/dance hall juxtaposition lacks creative integration. Eerie glow and whispers insufficient to create immersive, memorable atmosphere despite intriguing conceptual contrasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose (synthesis, coy aggression) sometimes obscures emotional authenticity. Subtext about legacy in the journal adds thematic resonance, but tension between science/wonder remains surface-level. Ending lacks narrative or emotional culmination.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies too heavily on supernatural-exorcist genre conventions. Forced integration of dance lessons and "coy aggression." Psychological depth feels algorithmically simulated rather than deeply imagined. Purple prose in atmospheric descriptions undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion sacrificed to element checklist. High-concept elements (psychic facility, puzzles) poorly contextualized within constrained scope. Brief length exacerbates rather than amplifies impact. Central theme about bridging worlds remains abstract and underdramatized.</comment>
