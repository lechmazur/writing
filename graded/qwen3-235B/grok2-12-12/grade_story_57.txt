<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Superficially defined traits (submissiveness, perception) rarely impact decision-making. Motivation is stated more than dramatized. Actions contradict "submissive" nature without nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows simple arc but depends on convenience. Liquidation of wax lacks procedural detail. Resolution feels abrupt rather than earned within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Secret agent workshop exists as empty exoticism. Sensory details are generic. The atmosphere neither complements nor intentionally contrasts with plot tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Emotional manipulation through repetitive adjectives. Minimal literary craft; theme of protection remains superficial. Ending lacks conceptual payoff or subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Clich√©d descriptions ("heart ached with silent empathy," "life she had protected") dominate. Overwritten phrases and predictable emotional cues suggest algorithmic patterning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Elements feel mechanically assembled rather than organically integrated. Style oscillates between florid and flat. Leaves no lingering resonance despite thematic aspirations.</comment>
