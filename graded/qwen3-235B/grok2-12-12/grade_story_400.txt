<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's guarded nature is hinted through symbolic gestures but lacks behavioral depth; ambivalence lacks nuanced expression through actions; motivation to overcome fear is clear but underexplored emotionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a quiet arc of ritual vs. isolation, but the 500-word constraint creates uneven pacing; resolution feels brief despite thematic consistency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but strays into poetic abstraction; metaphors feel fresh but occasionally border on ornate; emotional subtext is implied but not deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but rely heavily on atmospheric weight over narrative drive; tone lingers, but structural precision is uneven under tight length.</comment>
