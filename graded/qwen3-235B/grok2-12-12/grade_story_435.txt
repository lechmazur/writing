<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Flat, underdeveloped character whose actions are driven by abstract traits rather than organic motivation; "dream interpreter" role lacks psychological complexity or humanizing contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Functional three-act structure within tight constraints, but key plot mechanics (impersonation plan) feel under-explained; pacing uneven in middle due to repetitive atmospheric descriptions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (vapor, mist) create visual texture but fail to cohere into a fully realized world; setting functions more as foggy metaphor than lived-in space with internal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on recycled metaphors ("pulse," "calcify") weakens impact; themes of legal reform through dream subvert unconscious remain shallow; ending lacks resonant payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on sci-fi rebellion tropes without subversion; stiff, self-consciously poetic language ("occasionally frequent") feels contrived; emotional beats stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mechanical integration of assigned elements creates disjointed momentum; some creative sparks (dream-based activism) drowned out by formulaic structure and undercooked concepts.</comment>
