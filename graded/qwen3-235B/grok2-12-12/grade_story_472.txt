<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; traits like "sharp gentleness" are stated without substantial behavioral or motivational integration. Her role as a matchmaker isn't fully leveraged to create narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Formulaic progression: exposition, search, discovery. Pacing drags in middle sections despite brevity; the interstellar code's "revelation" feels abrupt without earned emotional or logical buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Evocative setting elements (zeppelin library) remain superficially described. The "ripple of a flag" simile and cosmic views lack sensorial specificity to create immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Uses poetic metaphors ("sharp gentleness") effectively but relies excessive "telling" (e.g., "heart heavy with weight"). The ending's message feels didactically appended rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>World-building combines appealingly paradoxical elements ("floating library" + "interstellar") but leans on clich√©d contrasts ("sharp gentleness," "complicatedly simple"). The decoding trope follows predictable narrative patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional execution. Elements coexist rather than synergize; the story remains a promising framework rather than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
