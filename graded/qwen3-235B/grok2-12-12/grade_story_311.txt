<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character traits stated but underdeveloped; motivation exists but lacks psychological depth or conflict, with minimal demonstration of how assigned traits shape behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels rushed; transitions between stages of realization are abrupt, with weak causal connections between collected stories and transformation. Pacing uneven within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Lunar setting offers novelty but lacks immersive sensory detail; atmosphere is inconsistently rendered, with sterile descriptions failing to deepen theme/motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d symbolism (greenhouse=rebirth) with shallow emotional resonance; writing style oscillates between ornate abstraction and vagueness, undermining narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Uses genre tropes (loner guard with past trauma) without subversion; phrases like "serene anger" feel deliberately poetic but inert. Predictable narrative arc weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Story elements present but poorly integrated (e.g., park visits); style often impedes clarity. Brevity seems restrictive rather than purposeful, lacking narrative depth or lingering impact.</comment>
