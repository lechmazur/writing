<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness feels surface-level; motivation to confront trauma is clear but transformation lacks nuance. Internal conflict is stated rather than deeply explored, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed. The mandala's role in healing is logical yet abrupt, leaving insufficient emotional buildup for the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting has vivid visual elements (shimmering walls, celestial light) but lacks immersive sensory details. The "grandiose subtlety" tone is inconsistent, veering toward vague mysticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (mandala, stars) effectively but relies on overt explanations of theme rather than subtext. Pacing allows for resolution, but emotional impact feels rushed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional clichés (e.g., "newfound peace") and predictable arc (trauma → healing) undercut originality. Metaphors are familiar rather than inventive, though the sand mandala’s imagery offers some freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements fit mechanically but lack deeper integration. The theme is explicit but underdeveloped. The ending resolves the arc, but the brief length exposes underexplored emotional terrain.</comment>
