<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Predictable moral code lacks complexity; motivations feel derivative of generic anti-hero tropes without nuanced psychological grounding. Reactions to bottle caps lack idiosyncratic voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot adheres to formulaic redemption arc structure with mechanical pacing. Object-driven progression feels contrived (bottle caps as arbitrary solution), weakening causal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting operates on confusing anachronistic mashup without internal consistency. Sensory details are generic checklist items rather than immersive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mild emotional resonance undercut by clich√©d humanization trope. Theme of historical erasure lacks intellectual depth; subtext remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on AI-writing hallmarks: overqualified descriptors ("delicate porcelain pot"), arbitrary object symbolism, and simplistic metaphor systems. Tropes substituted for originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through checklist-style element integration rather than organic narrative design. Ambitious concepts remain underexplored within constraints.</comment>
