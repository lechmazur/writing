<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's traits lack depth; motivation stated repeatedly without nuanced evolution. Reactions to elements feel artificially tied to assigned attributes rather than organically developed. Voice remains unremarkable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but simplistic. Connection between beginning and end exists, though progression feels formulaic rather than earned. Pacing adequate but unspectacular within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting described with generic steampunk tropes (brass, gears) but insufficient sensory detail. Atmosphere fails to transcend clich√© or enrich thematic tension through meaningful environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some symbolic use of imperfection-as-discovery but lacks emotional resonance or layered subtext. Ending fulfills narrative arc but lacks memorable impact or thematic revelation beyond surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Reliance on genre tropes (secret diary guardianship, steampunk libraries) without subversion. Repetitive phrasing ("precisely imperfect," "breathless longing") and overly declarative emotional states suggest formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack synergy. Story feels constructed around checklist rather than organic integration. Leaves no persistent intellectual or emotional resonance.</comment>
