<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "gracefully awkward" trait surfaces briefly but lacks depth; motivation to learn healing traditions feels underexplored; reactions to coded letter and nightmares insufficiently reveal internal conflicts; inconsistent alignment of actions with stated purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise drives plot initially, but integration of coded letter's "hidden agendas" falters; revamping menu lacks narrative urgency; abrupt shifts between mystical nightmare sequences and gourmet cooking undermine coherence; pacing strained by attempting to compress thematic arc into limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Setting's absurdist contradiction (ossuary/restaurant) feels gimmicked rather than atmospheric; sparse sensory details fail to harmonize "harsh tenderness" tone with either wilderness or culinary elements; cryptic symbols and nightmares lack tactile grounding in the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Healing as metaphor" concept stated more than shown; metaphors feel facile (kitchen = healing, nightmares = truth); ending's realization about "hidden agendas of the heart" lacks earned emotional weight; themes remain declarative rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reliance on incongruous tropes (war letters in ossuaries) without subversion; overwritten phrases ("harsh tenderness," "dance of creation") verge on pretentious; character logic follows checklist of assigned elements rather than organic motivation; lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements function as disconnected plot devices rather than narrative necessities; brief length accentuates disjointedness; style oscillates between mystical abstraction and mundane kitchen drama without synthesis; leaves no lingering emotional or intellectual impression.</comment>
