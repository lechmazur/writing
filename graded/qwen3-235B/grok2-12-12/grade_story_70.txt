<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's 'uptight' nature is shown through meticulous actions but her transformation feels rushed and lacks internal conflict exploration; motivations are stated more than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot is driven by adhesive analysis but pacing feels constrained; the puzzle-piece moment lacks emotional buildup, and the arc between her rigid mindset and transformation lacks sufficient connective tissue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gravestone-greenhouse setting is vivid with decay/illumination contrasts, but the witch's legacy isn't meaningfully integrated beyond surface allusions; Tesla bulb's historical contrast adds intrigue but feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'arms of steel' and light bulb symbolism work but verge on overt; emotional resonance is diluted by direct statements about empathy rather than layered subtext; ending's thematic clarity sacrifices nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some generic descriptors ('faint scent of decay') and the witch trope remain unchallenged; the 'certainly uncertain' framing adds little complexity; the bellowing moment feels oddly triumphant for a 'quiet transformation.'</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements function superficially but coherence wavers; the brief format undermines the transformation's gravity; atmospheric potential exceeds thematic payoff; lacks haunting resonance beyond its surface narrative.</comment>
