<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Jack's transition from gambler to seeker lacks psychological depth; Lena exists mainly as plot device. Motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Blueprint discovery inadequately anchors the plot's pivot point. Island memory integration feels arbitrary. Pacing collapses under word limit, with critical emotional beats reduced to summary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Workshop contains bland techno-junk descriptors without tactile specificity. "Hammered repose" concept remains abstract, disconnected from physical space. No meaningful correlation between videotapes and temporal setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Surface-level theme about finding harmony lacks subtextual complexity. Emotional arc flattens into clich√© redemption narrative. Weak metaphoric interplay between gambling and puzzle-solving mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</question><comment>Relies on contrived emotional pivots typical of AI writing. Overused phrases like "ghosts of old technologies" undermine originality. Blueprint's symbolic function feels derivative rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Elements present but shallowly interwoven. Workshop setting and videotapes remain decorative rather than structural. Transformations lack sufficient narrative scaffolding for emotional investment.</comment>
