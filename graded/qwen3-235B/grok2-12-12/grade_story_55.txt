<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Predictable romantic/doomed bard archetype; motivation to preserve craft is explicit but psychological depth lacking. Emotional arc remains static with minimal internal conflict or growth beyond stated determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Past-tense reflection lacks dramatic tension; circular contemplation replaces plot progression. Bell/keys/studio elements decorate but don't advance cause-effect; framing device of "new star" timeframe feels loosely applied.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Raucous silence effectively juxtaposes tangible atmosphere against emotional repression. Bell echoes add sonic texture but underutilized spatially; studio's "utopian" design elements remain abstract without functional specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (keys as past/openings, bell as temporal bridge) show thematic cohesion. Emotional resonance diluted by prioritizing poetic abstraction over concrete character behavior; subtext about legacy vs. obscurity remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Meandering sentences border on poetic excess ("raucous silence that was no longer heard but felt") without deepening meaning. Overreliance on melancholic tropes (doomed artist, fading traditions) with limited subversion; atmospheric continuity maintained despite stylistic unevenness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Serviceable integration of required elements with moderate thematic synergy. Prose polish contrasts with structural minimalism; emotional impact exists but insufficiently earns lingering resonance. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
