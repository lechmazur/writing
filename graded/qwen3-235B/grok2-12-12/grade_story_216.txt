<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation (abandoned identity) is evident but remains abstract; "obsessive calm" lacks tangible demonstration through internal monologue or actions; profession as scapegoat informs thematic weight but isn't fully explored through interactions or sacrifices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot contains required elements but lacks progression; cryptic calls and symbolic objects introduced without narrative momentum; abrupt transitions between locations; tightly compressed arc sacrifices emotional build; resolution feels preordained rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cloud city's ethereal quality creates mood, but setting remains static backdrop; sensory details (metal washer's coldness) present but sparse; atmosphere complements theme but doesn't actively shape character choices or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor of washer as burden works conceptually; cloud/mist imagery echoes identity loss; ending delivers thematic closure but lacks emotional specificity; overly reliant on told rather than shown transformations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Phrases like "shifting landscape" and "delicate balance" echo genre clich√©s; metaphors (dream/reality) lack innovation; ornate descriptors ("robustly delicate") prioritize style over substance; motivation feels algorithmically assigned rather than organically derived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements present but superficially integrated; library card bookend and cloud city feel arbitrary; stylistic flourishes overshadow narrative clarity; brevity hinders thematic depth; conceptually intriguing but insufficiently realized.</comment>
