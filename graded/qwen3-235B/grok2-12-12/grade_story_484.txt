<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is stated but underdeveloped; "groggy" and "uniquely generic" traits lack psychological depth. Transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through nuanced behavior. Ritual action aligns with stated values but doesn't deepen character understanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows ritual structure with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing uneven - too much ambient description, too little time showing the ritual's actual mechanics. Encroaching darkness concept drives action but lacks logical connection to protest timeframe element. Sudden discoloration spread feels arbitrary rather than causally connected to character's choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d gothic tropes without fresh subversion. Haunted mansion graveyard setting contributes baseline eeriness but isn't rendered through specific sensory details beyond "dusty" and "dark". Timeframe mention of protest lull creates interesting contrast but remains underexploited for thematic tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story creates haunting atmosphere through metaphorical darkness infusion, but relies too heavily on telling about emotional transformation rather than dramatizing it. Ritual's symbolic resonance exists at surface level without deeper existential exploration. Final protest participation adds thematic weight but feels hastily appended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Generic descriptors like "uniquely generic ales" and reductive darkness metaphors suggest formulaic thinking. The "grogy brewer" and ritual structure follow predictable fantasy tropes without innovation. Purple prose in wall descriptions contrasts with flat emotional articulation, creating uneven stylistic register.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements feel like checklist items rather than organic components - protest, mirror shard, and darkness don't fully coalesce. Brief format works for transformation arc but sacrifices depth. Final image has symbolic potency but lacks emotional urgency. Shows competent craft but lacks memorable daring.</comment>
