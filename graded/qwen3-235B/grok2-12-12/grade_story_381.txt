<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; the scuffed baseball cap as a symbolic anchor works but lacks deeper emotional nuance, leaving the necromancer's psyche only partially explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is static and repetitive, lacking progression or conflict; the focus on mapping fails to drive a coherent narrative arc within the constrained word limit, resulting in a fragmented sense of completeness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague descriptors rather than immersive sensory details; the crystalline cave’s futuristic nostalgia is hinted at but unevenly realized, failing to strongly enhance the narrative or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses symbolic motifs like the "sound of resolve" and baseball cap effectively but leans heavily on abstraction; emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition over showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Combines elements in an original premise but relies on overused tropes (e.g., mourning protagonist) and repetitive phrasing; moments of insight are undercut by formulaic descriptions and inconsistent thematic emphasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than cohesive; the story’s brevity weakens character and plot development, though the concept of mapping as a grieving process offers faint thematic resonance.</comment>
