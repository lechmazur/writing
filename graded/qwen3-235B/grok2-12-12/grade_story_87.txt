<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Limited plot movement creates structural fragility; peeling stickers provide procedural coherence but minimal narrative momentum; emotional resolution feels abrupt despite circular framing of memory and healing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk elements provide visual texture without material significance; sensory details remain decorative rather than atmospheric; mixtape "throb" metaphorically disconnected from physical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical stickers create emotional resonance; ending achieves thematic closure but with predictable arc; attempts subtext through object symbolism but lacks narrative risk-taking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Excessive conceptual incongruence ("hyperactively serene," "savagely graceful") strains suspension of disbelief; ornate descriptions occasionally border on purple prose; tonal whiplash between steampunk imagery and modern stickers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than interlock; brevity sacrifices psychological complexity; thematic core about hollow victories remains under-interrogated, leaving structural reliance on familiar redemption tropes.</comment>
