<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters are delicately sketched but lack emotional depth; Kaito's transformation feels unearned despite Hana's consistent motivation. Their distinctiveness remains blurred beneath atmospheric abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral meteor patterns drive the plot but create arbitrary stakes. The art-class framework provides structure, yet the progression to cosmic connection feels contrived rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Castle's "distant intimacy" is atmospherically evoked but underutilized—its physical and symbolic potential as a sanctuary remains largely decorative rather than integral to character interactions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors about transience resonate, but the story prioritizes poetic description over visceral storytelling. The silence between characters creates intrigue but sacrifices narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concepts of cosmic-artistic fate are fresh but undercut by clichéd descriptors ("whisper across time") and a formulaic mentor-student arc where emotional nuances remain stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially around metaphysical themes but lack unified imaginative daring—reads as assembly of lyrical tropes rather than a transcendent whole demanding reader engagement.</comment>
