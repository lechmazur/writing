<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; sheepishness and analytical creativity lack nuanced influence on actions/motivation. Dialogue feels somewhat forced, inconsistent emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear arc within word limit, but pacing feels rushed in key moments (monster emergence). Logical cause-effect but lacks narrative tension progression. Plot relies on underexplained concept execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is competent (dim corridors, lamp visuals) but lacks sensory richness beyond sight. Setting ("pattern recognition center") fails to meaningfully connect with themes or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some metaphorical potential with light patterns symbolizing hopes, but themes (unity through storytelling) lack layered exploration. Ending feels overly tidy rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on redemption/redemption clich√©s with minimal subversion. Stilted phrasing ("earnest mockery") and inconsistent tone. Setting/detail choices feel generic rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak cohesion despite using most elements. Some creative combinations (lamp symbolism) but constrained by superficial integration of core concepts. Fails to transcend assigned parameters.</comment>
