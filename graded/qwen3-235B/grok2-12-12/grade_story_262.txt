<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character defined by descriptors rather than actions; vague "righteously flawed" trait lacks concrete manifestation. Motivation to rescue lost knowledge remains abstract without specific stakes or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lacks clear narrative arc; static atmosphere replaces plot progression. Cause-effect relationships weak, with pivotal moments feeling unearned despite word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting described superficially; Roman bathhouse's historical weight mentioned but not woven into action. Sensory details generic and inconsistently deployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on telling over showing; metaphors stale ("melody of struggle"). Theme of fear vs. knowledge hinted but never crystallized. Ending lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Purple prose ("haunting reverberation of a lonely church organ"), repetitive phrases, and abstract descriptors suggest formulaic writing. Emotional nuance sacrificed for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Element integration superficial; themes remain embryonic. Attempts at depth undermined by lack of narrative urgency or concrete character decisions.</comment>
