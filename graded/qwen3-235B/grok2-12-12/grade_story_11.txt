<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits conflict (flighty vs. normal) and motivation lacks emotional depth; "serene anger" feels artificial rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear arc from presentation to societal inspiration, but pacing is rushed and "throughout practice" timeframe serves no functional purpose.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Secret society setting is underdeveloped; "serene anger" tone contradicts atmospheric potential; sensory details are virtually nonexistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Intelligent metaphorical approach through cartography-as-unity concept; subtext about hidden histories in art is promising but shallowly explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original premise with specific technical vocabulary resists clich√©s; avoids most AI patterns despite occasional abstractions ("serene anger") feeling contrived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Element integration appears checklist-driven rather than organic; core "hidden details in paintings" mechanism fails to convince as story foundation.</comment>
