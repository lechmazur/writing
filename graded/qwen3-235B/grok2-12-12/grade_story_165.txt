<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond being a plot device; motivation is clear but unexplored emotionally, with reactions remaining reactive rather than revealing inner complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure is visible but rushed due to word constraints; cause-effect logic holds, but key moments like the fountain's reassembly feel abbreviated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Surface-level sensory details establish environment but fail to create immersive atmosphere; the dwarves' culture and the city's history remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on conventional fantasy imagery with limited subtext; the theme of justice is stated but not thematically interrogated, though the symbolic garden rebirth creates emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some stock phrases ("gentle conjurer") and predictable arcs, but the stained glass butterfly concept adds mild originality; emotional beats are shown through action rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Functional but unremarkable execution; all elements present yet rarely cohere into something transcendentally meaningful or stylistically distinctive.</comment>
