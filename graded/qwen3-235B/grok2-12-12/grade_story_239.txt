<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivation is stated but not dramatized through meaningful conflict or moral complexity. Actions remain abstract gestures rather than consequences of concrete desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves structural symmetry but relies on artificial contrivances (power outage as deus ex machina). Development feels curatorial rather than causally inevitable; climax lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere contains vivid details but setting remains inert backdrop. Sensory elements (whispers, odors) attempt immersion but fail to create tactile immediacy or thematic reinforcement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on symbolic abstraction over emotional resonance. Metaphors (labyrinth, zephyr) lack concrete embodiment; ending resolves superficially without substantive catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Self-consciously poetic prose veers toward pretension. Recurrent descriptors ("radiant shifts," "formally imperfect") feel like empty incantations rather than organic imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present but insufficiently fused. Conceptual framework dominates over narrative flow; length exposes underdeveloped relationships between motifs and story logic.</comment>
