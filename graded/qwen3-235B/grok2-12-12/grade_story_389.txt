<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Main traits recur but lack complexity; motivation is explicit but shallowly explored; repetitive emphasis on descriptors (e.g., "thin-lipped") without psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Epileptic structure: starts with premise, cycles through environmental descriptions and repeated intentions, ends without resolution; cause-effect is linear but lacks narrative momentum or surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ambient details like dust-choked air and glowing fragment eyes create texture, but the setting remains a static backdrop; calendar timeframe fails to catalyze urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric language compensates for lack of subtext; symbols (fragment's gaze) gesture at themes but aren't developed; writing occasionally elevates tone through tactile imagery but lacks conceptual cohesion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases ("confusing certainty," "gorge on knowledge") betray formulaic construction; generic dark-magic tropes (haunted artifacts, forbidden libraries) dominate without subversion; emotional register remains intellectualized, not visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but mechanically assembled; style oscillates between verbose and barren; short format neither leverages constraint nor transcends it; concept of "optimization" remains abstract.</comment>
