<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Harmony's selflessness as a musician lacks emotional depth; her actions align with her role but fail to demonstrate nuanced motivation or distinct voice. The intersection between her musical identity and mission remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (crisis → resolution) but feels compressed within the word limit. The nebula incident drives momentum, though the resolution via sound feels slightly contrived and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Poor use of sensory detail to ground the recycled spaceship setting; descriptions rely on abstract phrases like "intangibly tangible." The timeless vacuum of space is underexploited as a mood device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clever symbolism of the vinyl record as a metaphor for trust elevates the narrative, but emotional stakes remain low. The story gestures at themes without fully committing to their exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on clichéd imagery (music pacifying cosmic threats) and vague abstraction (e.g., "savage grace") weakens originality. Atmospheric details often border on purple prose without sufficient payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story coherently incorporates all elements but unevenly integrates them. Some threads (e.g., "recycled spaceship") feel like set dressing. The brief length works but leaves thematic potential unfulfilled.</comment>
