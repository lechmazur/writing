<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolic and introspective but lacks nuanced emotional depth; motivations are clear but somewhat abstract, relying heavily on metaphoric resonance over human specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Loose arc from longing to acceptance lacks urgency; cause and effect blurred by poetic abstraction, though the tight structure maintains minimal cohesion through motif repetition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory detail (wax, tide sounds) but leans on clichéd symbolism (sea as fate); setting enhances philosophical themes but lacks tangible uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (candle as fleeting spark, lectures as risk) deepen subtext; ending avoids triteness by embracing paradoxical peace—though character voice is occasionally overshadowed by lush prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept strained by contrivances (unhinged professors veering into caricature); avoids predictable endings but lapses into ornamental language that distances emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through recurring motifs more than plot; brevity serves thematic focus but sacrifices dynamic character engagement, leaving lingering aesthetic over existential resonance.</comment>
