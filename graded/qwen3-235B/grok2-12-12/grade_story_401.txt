<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's wilderness guide identity isn't fully integrated into motivations or actions. Motivation for reconciliation lacks specific behavioral grounding, relying on internal monologue over demonstrated actions. "Guiltily innocent" gesture feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression from introspection to resolve maintains basic coherence, but compressed word count weakens emotional buildup. Diaries-in-blanket method feels contrived, rushed transition to resolution undermines narrative gravity. Cause/effect connections exist but lack depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (murky water light, blanket texture) create immersive atmosphere. Sunken ship setting metaphorically aligns with fractured relationship theme. Tension between mundane coffee ritual and fantastical setting enhances thematic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Uses metal ring and sunken ship as functional symbols, but emotional resonance remains surface-level through explicit statements ("guilt lessened"). Metaphors (ship as broken relationship) show promise but aren't fully developed. Ending lacks surprise or thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (hidden family secrets, reconciliation arcs) without subverting them. Crocheted diary concept borders on implausibility. Overuse of poetic abstractions ("manic clarity") risks pretension. Wilderness guide element feels inserted rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements form functional narrative but lack organic cohesionâ€”wilderness guide in sunken ship feels arbitrary. Story structure prioritizes assigned elements over natural pacing. Lingering impression centers on symbols rather than emotional authenticity.</comment>
