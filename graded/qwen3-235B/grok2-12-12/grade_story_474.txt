<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Shallow character depth; motivations implied but not deeply explored. Elara's actions align with her role, but her internal life feels underdeveloped. Marco’s introduction lacks nuance beyond basic backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Basic structure present but underwhelming. Transitions (e.g., Marco’s sudden appearance) feel abrupt. The chessboard’s symbolic role is hinted but not tightly woven into plot progression. Pacing uneven, with rushed thematic revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting has intriguing elements (celestial grotto, living shadows) but lacks immersive sensory details. Atmosphere uneven—rebels’ nightmares and shadows’ reactions are underutilized, creating tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of diversity is stated clearly but not deeply explored. Chessboard metaphor works, but emotional impact is muted by overt "message" delivery. Writing style occasionally relies on clichéd phrasing (“beacon of hope”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Combines unique elements (living shadows, chessboard symbolism) but execution feels archetypal. Overuse of flowery descriptors (“intricately simple setup”) and predictable tropes dilute originality. Subtext feels superficially applied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated. Ambitious concept constrained by underdeveloped connections between rebellion, channeled spirits, and chessboard metaphor. Shows glimmers of thematic cohesion but fails to fully synthesize.</comment>
