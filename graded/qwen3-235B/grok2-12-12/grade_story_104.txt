<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation is conceptually clear but lacks depth; the steward remains a cipher rather than a fully realized individual. His actions align with stoicism and defiance of conformity but never transcend archetype to reveal human complexity or conflicting impulses.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative lacks dynamic progression; plot exists primarily as a vessel for abstract ideas. Circular structure provides minimal closure, with no tangible stakes or obstacles. The "action" of placing the label feels inert, offering neither climax nor revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is evocative and immersive. The miniature world museum's fragile beauty contrasts with the steward's grim resolve. Sensory details (echoing steps, dawn’s shadows) effectively anchor the melancholic, haunting atmosphere without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (bird skull, frozen orchard) invites interpretation and aligns with themes, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy-handed exposition. The ending’s cyclical return to vigilance avoids cheap sentimentality but leaves thematic resonance underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (guardian of secrets, coded messages, rebellion against conformity) without subverting them. Some lush imagery contrasts with flat, declarative sentences about "cracks in the façade." Tropes like "cynical warmth" feel forced, undermining originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency. The miniature museum and steward’s ritual create a compelling mood, but the story functions more as a mood piece than a complete narrative. Constraints of length aren’t fully transcended.</comment>
