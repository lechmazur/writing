<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on repetitive loops without clear causality between action and consequence. Fragments of progression but lacks tight arc within constraints. Conceptual framework shapes narrative but feels abstract rather than structural.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes decay and cosmic wonder but sensory details remain generic. Timeframe phrase “hush of unraveling tapestry” is abstract rather than immersive. Atmospheric contrasts exist but lack concrete grounding.</comment>
