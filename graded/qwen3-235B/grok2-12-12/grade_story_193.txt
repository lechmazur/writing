<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prince's motivation for curing loneliness is consistent but underexplored; "unintentionally iconic" trait superficially sketched through tattered garb but lacks deeper psychological nuance; his abrupt shift from potion-seeking to community-building feels under-motivated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows familiar arc of isolation to redemption but feels rushed; snowstorm-generated encounter lacks organic buildup; connection between key-turning and abandoned customs office remains symbolic rather than causal; resolution sacrifices emotional weight for neatness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid sensory details (howling wind, smooth mortar surfaces); "familiar unknown" tone effectively rendered via juxtaposing royal decay with transformative potential; setting authentically supports themes of isolation and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery of abandoned spaces as metaphors for emotional states is effective; ending provides thematic cohesion but lacks subtextual complexity; emotional impact diluted by predictable "connection over potion" revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Limited originality in exiled prince trope and storm-generated encounter; some purple prose ("haunted him since his banishment"); metaphor of key-turned-past borders on clich√©; character development leans on explicit telling rather than nuanced showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements combined competently but not innovatively; word limit exposes underdeveloped aspects (unseen forces, iconic status); thematic resonance present but surface-level; memorable setting elevates otherwise conventional structure.</comment>
