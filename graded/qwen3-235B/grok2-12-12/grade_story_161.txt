<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weakly defined vigilance; grief motivation feels generic. Peacock interaction lacks emotional stakes. Orcharding methods as metaphor are superficial and underexplored. "Sardonic glee" reads as authorial imposition rather than organic personality trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Conspiracy resolution is abrupt and ludicrous. Pattern-matching between peacock feathers and seal lacks logical progression. Pacing collapses under word limit constraints. Beginning/end connection exists only through forced symmetry rather than earned narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Setting amounts to decorative vagueness. Paper airplane facility remains unelaborated; peacock's presence is arbitrary rather than atmospheric. Sardonic tone inconsistently applied against tragic backstory. Sensory details are rote checklist items without thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Patently mechanical use of metaphors (orchardist = conspiracy solver). Over-explicit emotional cues replace subtext. Thematic contradiction: "victory as tribute" undermines stated message about unresolved journeys. Ending feels artificially triumphant rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Catastrophic cliche overload: grieving widow, magical animal patterns, locket-with-clue contrivance. Sentence structures exhibit AI's typical abstraction oscillation. Sardonicism is repeatedly named rather than demonstrated. Setting contains no authentic vocational specificity about orcharding or paper airplane testing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elements appear as forced checkmarks rather than organic components. Short length accentuates disjointed construction. No lingering thematic resonance; reliance on superficial cleverness. Narrative architecture resembles algorithmic puzzle-box rather than literary expression.</comment>
