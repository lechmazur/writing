<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paladin's motivation is clear but lacks depth; reactions to the needle and boredom are underdeveloped. No distinct voice in third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Structure is coherent but rushed; the blackout encounter and resolution feel abrupt. Pacing unevenly handles the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is atmospheric but under-imagined; sensory details are sparse. "Lavishly austere" contrasts with the setting concept but lacks integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of revival implied but not deeply explored. Relies on stated emotions ("morose," "excitement") rather than subtext or symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Formulaic elements (paladin quest, blackout plot device). Language occasionally veers toward "lavishly austere" clich√©s without subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but inconsistently executed. Tone shifts (bored excitement) and timeframe feel disconnected. Lingers mildly in theme but lacks transformative depth.</comment>
