<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent first-person voice undermines character depth despite clear motivation and some symbolic actions; emotional nuance feels surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc from discovery to transformation, but rushed pacing in emotional progression; cause/effect between found notepad and artistic breakthrough lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric setting is visually distinct but sensory underdevelopment limits immersion; zero-gravity book detail effective but isolated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (notepad as bridge, "whisper of past") skillfully executed but emotional impact diluted by excessive explanatory prose rather than visceral showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic pitfalls but relies on expected "artist finds muse" beats; "realms of surprise" phrasing feels artificial, and adjectives occasionally border on poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion across elements but conceptual ambition outweighs emotional heft; brevity serves atmosphere better than character development.</comment>
