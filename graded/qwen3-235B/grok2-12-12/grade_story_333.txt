<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but undershows; bitterness is named but not embodied through nuanced action or subtext, reducing depth of "sincere rebel" beyond performative rebellion against abstraction. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable beats with mechanical cause-effect; tension relies on formulaic "shifting walls" trope, though the storm framework provides structural cohesion within tight word limits. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on familiar haunted-house descriptors (groaning walls, thick air) without specific, unexpected sensory details to make the space uniquely memorable or thematically resonant. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery like "walls alive" and motif of preserving legacy offer thematic clarity, but emotional beats are signaled rather than earned; resolution feels narratively neat without earned catharsis. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing ("walls shifting," "cryptic symbols") and reliance on Gothic clich√©s undercut originality; "braided bitterness" lacks sustained textual embodiment to suggest authorial inventiveness. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Serviceable execution with competent integration of required elements, but fails to transcend genre conventions or provoke lasting contemplation beyond its surface plot and themes. </comment>
