<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's traits remain superficial; "ferociously polite" moments are isolated, motivations feel abstract rather than organically integrated into behavior or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Premise-driven rather than plot-driven; the intervention lacks escalating stakes, and the compressed resolution feels contrived despite clear beginning/middle/end scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting details are sparse and arbitrary—flower workshop and mariner’s wheel lack functional interconnection, diluting immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Themes of harmony are stated more than dramatized; metaphors (wheel, pressed flowers) hint at deeper layers but remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overreliance on vague descriptors ("ferociously polite," "anguished joy") leans into cliché; emotional beats are declared rather than subtextually earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional but unremarkable—elements are present without transformative cohesion; conceptually sound but lacking visceral impact or innovation.</comment>
