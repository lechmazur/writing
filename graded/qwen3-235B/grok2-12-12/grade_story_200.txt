<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and motivation are present but underdeveloped; emotional stakes feel abstract rather than visceral. The compass as an object shaping action is stronger than the mosaic-as-motivation, which remains overly metaphorical without concrete emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is thematically coherent but strained by the word limit; cause-and-effect in the sabotage process feels vague. The mosaic's completion provides resolution, but the rhythm-as-communication device lacks technical or emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (ozone, cobblestone vibrations) and the resonance chamber's paradoxical serenity. The "savage" tone is vivid but occasionally overwritten, straining immersion in logical consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (mosaic, compass) create thematic resonance, but emotional beats rely on abstraction ("shattered hopes") rather than specific human experiences. The ending achieves poetic closure but feels earned conceptually rather than through character action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "savage serenity") avoid clich√© but teeter toward poetic excess. The mosaic concept is original, yet the narrative voice occasionally defaults to ornate abstraction rather than grounded human truths, risking artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a thematically resonant whole, but the mosaic's abstract emotional payoff feels more philosophical than viscerally felt. The brevity enhances focus but leaves character psychology underexplored.</comment>
