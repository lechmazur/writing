<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character voice lacks distinctiveness; wit is stated but not demonstrated through dialogue or actions. Motivation (learning traditional methods) drives plot but isn't deeply explored through the character's unique perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has basic coherence with beginning/middle/end, but pacing feels rushed during emotional turning point (music/dance revelation). The "confiscate" action is clear but lacks tangible stakes within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic haunted tropes without rich sensory immersion. Setting details (lighthouse bedroom) feel superficial rather than integral to the theme. Wind/music lacks grounding in specific environmental details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Melodic subtext and rope symbolism offer some thematic depth, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy-handed exposition. The theme of tradition/repair is clear but underdeveloped through showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Frequent abstract phrasing ("reckless precision," "eroding promises") borders on poetic vagueness. Character reactions lean on stated emotions rather than nuanced behavior. Dance method feels like an imposed trope rather than organic element.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story attempts thematic unity but struggles to fully integrate assigned elements organically. The ending provides closure but lacks lasting resonance. Elements like "dry wit" and "certainty" feel more structural than meaningful.</comment>
