<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Marco's motivation for connection is clear but underexplored; his actions (e.g., sitting with the box) lack psychological nuance, reducing his agency to passive receptivity. The "eager lookout" attribute doesn't substantially shape his decisions or unique voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a simplistic arc from discovery to spectral communication to resolution, but pacing feels rushed and cause-effect logic is thin (e.g., spirits immediately "trust" Marco without meaningful progression). The ending resolves too neatly for its thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The villa's blend of old and new is stated more than shown; sensory details (e.g., smell of ancient wood, tactile contrast between modern surfaces and bone needles) are sparse, weakening immersion. Atmosphere leans on vague "haunted" clich√©s rather than distinct mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Themes of connection and legacy are earnest but surface-level. The sewing box as a symbol is underutilized, and the resolution opts for tidy closure over resonant ambiguity. Emotional beats are declared ("sense of wonder") rather than evoked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on paranormal tropes (poltergeist activity as vague disturbances) without subversion. Phrases like "ruthless kindness" and "technically organic" feel conceptually strained. Emotional subtext is generalized, leaning on explicit statements rather than layered implications.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mechanically cohesive but derivative; elements like the poltergeist and sewing box function as plot devices rather than organic components. The tight length highlights structural gaps, though the digital-age contrast with spiritualism suggests unexploited thematic potential.</comment>
