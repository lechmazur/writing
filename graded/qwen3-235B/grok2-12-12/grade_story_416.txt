<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent character voice; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through actions; academic rebellion not sufficiently tied to plot. Traits like "straight-laced knight" feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Incomplete narrative arc; abrupt transitions (scoreboard reset lacks payoff); character meeting feels contrived rather than earned through plot logic. Pacing uneven within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic descriptors ("luminous swamp") without immersive sensory integration; setting fails to shape character decisions or thematic depth; tone inconsistent between mystical and grounded elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Shallow symbolism; predictable dialogue lacking subtext; theme of converging destinies declared rather than dramatized; ending lacks emotional residue or thematic closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Formulaic character descriptors; repetitive "laconic exuberance" phrasing; emotional beats told rather than shown; setting details generic rather than specific; overall narrative lacks psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements function mechanically rather than organically; short length exposes underdeveloped connections between championship reset, swamp setting, and destiny theme; lacks narrative ambition beyond checklist fulfillment.</comment>
