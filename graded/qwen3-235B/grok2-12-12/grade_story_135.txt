<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Weak character depth; motivation stated but underdeveloped. Bolt’s loyalty is mentioned but lacks emotional resonance. Brewer role poorly integrated with primary plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on contrived developments (bruises as a map). Pacing uneven; ending feels abrupt despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ambient details like icy winds and mechanical caravans establish mood but lack specificity. Worldbuilding feels half-realized, failing to fully contextualize the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Themes of cultural preservation surface but lack emotional weight. Symbolism (straw as pen) is underdeveloped. Ending lacks thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mechanical dog/caravans and “peculiar faith” lean on genre tropes. Bruises-as-map concept borders on gimmicky. Prose avoids purple patches but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere勉强; forced connections (e.g., bruises as map) undermine cohesion. Story touches on worthwhile themes but executes them superficially.</comment>
