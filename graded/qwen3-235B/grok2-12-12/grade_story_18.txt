<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Statue’s telepathic motivation clear but underdeveloped; woman’s actions lack nuanced reasoning. Tragic joy feels superficial rather than informing choices. Character voices generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but compressed awkwardly. Weatherizing drives minimal action, yet connection between vision-sharing and resolution feels abrupt. Pacing uneven, underdeveloped cause-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Steam-powered square provides texture but worldbuilding remains decorative. Gloomy cheerfulness present yet tone inconsistently maintained. Sensory details sparse, failing to immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (ink, hair tie) adds layers, and ending offers emotional resonance. Some showing of emotions, but theme of recognition vs. truth lacks depth. Ending abrupt, weaker than potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Formulaic metaphors and generic descriptors present (e.g., “bustling crowd,” “hazy glow”). Calligraphy method feels contrived. Purple prose avoids extremes but lacks consistent stylistic originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story achieves minimal cohesion, with elements loosely connected rather than synergistic. Tone and brevity work but depth sacrificed. Conceptual bones exist but execution lacks urgency.</comment>
