<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (seeking courage) drives actions, but "loudly introverted" lacks deeper exploration. Transformation feels somewhat abstract rather than earned through nuanced decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc and coherence despite constraints, but the action of restoring the CD resolves the conflict too conveniently, undermining the stakes of "crooked hope."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (neon cathedral, fog, fireflies) are vivid and atmospheric, though the timeframe ("last human story") is underutilized as a narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (CD as courage, fireflies as guides) is effective, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract phrases like "crooked hope" instead of concrete subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Struggles with uneven proseâ€”cliches ("catalyst for reunion") and over-ornamentation clash with moments of originality in blending cathedral and neon motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but rely on familiar tropes (relics sparking transformation). The timeframe and "loudly introverted" traits feel superficially integrated compared to core narrative beats.</comment>
