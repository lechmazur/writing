<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's methodically playful demeanor informs actions, but lacks interiority or distinct voice; motivations implied but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic actions, but rushed resolution and fragmented pacing within constraints undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mood is evocative but inconsistently integrated; sensory details (e.g., "worn fabric") and sunken zeppelin atmosphere work, but "radio static" timeframe remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (ghost costume, chain of letters) and theme of illusion vs. reality resonate, but ending feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and layered subtext counterbalance overwrought phrases like "calm frenzy"; avoids clich√©s but leans on abstract conceptualization over visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story coalesces around transformation and collective awakening themes but falters under strict word limits; conceptually rich but execution uneven.</comment>
