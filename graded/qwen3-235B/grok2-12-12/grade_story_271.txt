<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Motivation stated but lacks emotional or psychological depth; actions align with assigned traits but characterization remains abstract and symbolic rather than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks forward momentum; repetitive thematic statements replace narrative progression; coherence maintained but no clear arc within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Abandoned lab setting has potential but superficially rendered; sensory details (rare spices) unevenly weighted rather than immersive; tone occasionally matches defiant compassion but feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in bent ruler and cosmic punchline; subtext about tradition vs. creativity present; ending loops back to theme but relies on stated epiphany rather than earned revelation; more "telling" weakens emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cleverness but leans on philosophical abstraction tropes; some phrases (e.g., "shared smile") risk overused etherealism; sensory details and metaphors sufficiently novel but edges of formulaic sentence rhythm; emotional nuance thin.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but forced; lab setting and spice method feel like checklist items; thematic consistency exists but depth lost to lyrical abstraction; brief length exposes underdeveloped tensions; memorable style outweighs structural rigor.</comment>
