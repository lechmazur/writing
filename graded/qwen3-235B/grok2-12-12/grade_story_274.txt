<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has definable traits but lacks interiority; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through specific actions or emotional contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; transitions between key moments (e.g., decision to journey) lack sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned drive-in setting is vivid and thematically resonant; sensory details (crumbling screens, dust) create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors the story’s emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment>Literary devices like the bookmark’s symbolism and film reels as memory metaphors are effective, but deeper subtextual layers could enhance emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uses AI-friendly tropes (e.g., sentient plants, abandoned places) but adds original twists; some phrasing borders on poetic abstraction rather than purposeful clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally forced; brevity works thematically but limits nuanced exploration of key ideas like "unspokenness."</comment>
