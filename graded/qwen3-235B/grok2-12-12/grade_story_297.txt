<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Flat character with stated rather than shown motivations. Rebellion and ancestral ties lack nuance or internal conflict; emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lacks a concrete plot arcâ€”progression feels vague and atmospheric rather than driven. Resolution seems abrupt, with minimal cause-effect momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic atmosphere through lava imagery and songs, but sensory details lack specificity. Setting is visually distinct but underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts symbolism (tattoos as bridges) and lyrical prose, but lacks thematic depth and emotional payoff. Conflict is abstract, undermining impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on mystical-artist tropes and overwrought phrases ("whispers of forgotten songs"). Lacks subversion; tone risks feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synthesis. Short-form constraints hinder development, leaving story feeling fragmented and incomplete.</comment>
