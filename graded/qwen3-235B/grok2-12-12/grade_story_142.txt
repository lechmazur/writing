<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Julian's aristocrat status informs his motivation to reclaim legacy but lacks emotional depth; his internal struggle is stated rather than embodied through nuanced choices, and his "distinct voice" disappears in overly expository narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear trail of clues that drive progression, but the 500-word constraint leaves pivotal moments (e.g., deciphering recipes) underdeveloped; the beginning-to-end connection feels perfunctory despite a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere excels in sensory details like "shimmering petals" and creaking roller coasters, though the setting occasionally feels staticâ€”interactions between Julian and the environment lack dynamism that could deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor ("serpent-twisting coaster") elevate the story, but the ending leans on catharsis without earned emotional weight; the legacy theme is clear but lacks subtext, and "showing" is diluted by summary.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tropes (haunted parks, legacy quests) persist without subversion; descriptions occasionally veer into ornate abstraction ("blurry vividness"), while Julian's reasoning feels overly logical for a "spirit-harmonizing" protagonist, hinting at formulaic beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The assigned elements are competently woven into a cohesive plot, but the story leans on familiar motifs without innovative synthesis; brevity feels limiting rather than intentional, and thematic depth remains surface-level.</comment>
