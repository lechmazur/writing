<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation and agoraphobia shape Eleanor's actions, but internal complexity remains underexplored; transformation feels somewhat abrupt despite logical alignment with traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structure demonstrates arc (fear → action → resolution), but pacing feels compressed; logical cause/effect between snuffbox activation and emotional breakthrough lacks sufficient buildup within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (rain, murmuring dunes) create strong atmosphere; however, "realistically fanciful" tone occasionally disrupts coherence between magical realism and grounded psychological struggles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (snuffbox as burden/empowerment) and emotional resonance, but lacks subversive depth; themes are clear yet somewhat familiar, diluting memorability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through poetic precision but contains moments of abstract telling ("eager resignation") and slightly formulaic transitions (e.g., dunes "urging forward"); metaphors remain original but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere cosmetically but lack deeper symbiosis; the constrained format prevents full thematic maturation despite deliberate structure, leaving emotional impact slightly ephemeral.</comment>
