<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks nuanced connection between insomnia, meticulous messiness, and non-violence pursuit. Revelations through drunken confessions feel abrupt and underexplored, weakening consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot structure shows faint arc but suffers from disjointed transitions between attic, subway, and party. Pacing uneven; causal relationships between whispers, confessions, and transformation remain superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Haunted attic atmosphere has potential but is undercut by sparse sensory immersion. Botanical samples and subway timeframes poorly integrated into cohesive worldbuilding; tone oscillates without purposeful contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Attempts metaphorical depth (whispers as inner turmoil) but relies excessively on telling rather than showing. Thematic exploration of non-violence lacks punch, with ending feeling perfunctory rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Drunken confessions and haunted attic tropes used predictably without subversion. Overwritten phrasing ("empty abundance") and abrupt emotional shifts suggest artificial construction rather than organic character-driven narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but forced together without synergistic cohesion. Story struggles to balance assigned components within brevity constraint, resulting in structural fragility rather than focused literary precision.</comment>
