<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Consistent motivation but lacks emotional nuance; the paradoxical "exultant grief" remains abstract rather than being embodied through actions or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Relies heavily on circular narrative structure to imply completeness; cause-effect within the constrained arc is logical but lacks tension or transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Etheral setting evokes vivid imagery but struggles to ground sensory details in concrete textures; atmosphere supports tone but setting-object cohesion feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegantly layered symbolism (fragments, infinity) enhances emotional resonance; lacks strong central conflict, weakening narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s yet leans on abstract phrasing ("repulsively attractive") that feels intentionally dissonant rather than organically meaningful; stylistic risks enhance originality but occasionally obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements like "park fountain" clash subtly with subterranean orchard; stylistic ambition compensates for occasional narrative fragmentation but sacrifices narrative momentum.</comment>
