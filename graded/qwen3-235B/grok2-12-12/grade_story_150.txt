<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Outlaw cowboy poet trait is superficially applied; motivations are stated rather than organically revealed through nuanced actions. Reactions to dice and misaligned gears lack psychological depth, remaining literal rather than metaphorical.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrative momentum exists but relies too heavily on repetitive cause-effect cycles (roll dice => shift walls => recite poem). Pacing feels artificially compressed in final act, reducing emotional weight of the "shared purpose" transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory contains intriguing contradictions but sensory details remain clinical - we hear gears and see shifting walls, but lack tactile smells (scent of oil?) or bodily interaction with brass machinery. Atmosphere becomes stage dressing rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intertwined destinies" theme is verbally explicit but lacks symbolic resonance. The "journey is destination" ending feels like a placeholder aphorism rather than earned revelation. Too much stated through character exposition rather than embedded through craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mixes distinctive elements (cowboy poet + steampunk) but lapses into clich√©d phrasing ("echoing like thunder," "came alive"). Changing coffee shop walls border on magical convenience rather than thematically integrated wonder. Emotional beats often summarized rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved through relentless repetition of core elements, but lacks transcendent synthesis. The tight brief is visible in seams rather than feeling organically compressed. Lingering question is more conceptual than emotionally potent.</comment>
