<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's stage fright is present but underdeveloped; exorcist role is superficial, motivation lacks psychological depth, actions remain abstract and disconnected from visceral stakes</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plotted as symbolic arc but lacks causal momentum, key turning feels contrived, resolution collapses too quickly for emotional resonance within the word limit's demands</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting is visually intriguing but inert - atmosphere relies on descriptors rather than immersive sensory contrast between celestial void and domestic objects like wildflowers</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Themes of inherited falsehoods operate at surface level; metaphors about fragile flowers vs. space wreckage lack interplay; ending resorts to cliched triumphalism rather than earned revelation</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements exist side-by-side rather than symbiotically - orbital debris doesn't pressure character choices, wildflowers function as checklist symbolism, "defiant hush" remains descriptive rather than structural</comment>
