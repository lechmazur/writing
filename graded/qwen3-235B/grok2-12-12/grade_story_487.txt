<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's docile brusier trait and brash tenderness are inconsistently demonstrated beyond surface-level descriptors. Motivation to "mold a myth" lacks psychological depth or tangible connection to his actions beyond plot device usage.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot strains under compressed word limit: rushed introductions of travelers, abrupt baton acquisition, and underdeveloped resolution. Assigned action (twist through labyrinth) drives movement but fails to create satisfying narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting's intriguing potential (greenhouse labyrinth + drum solos) is undermined by vague sensory details. Atmosphere feels fragmented rather than cohesive, failing to meaningfully interact with character motivation or conceptual themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lacks emotional authenticity and literary craft. Heavy reliance on abstract statements over concrete imagery; themes of myth-building and unity remain under-explored. Ending feels artificially triumphant without earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Relies on genre clich√©s (treasure hunts, labyrinth dangers, resurrection tropes) without subversion. Repetitive phrasing ("disturbingly calm" / "brash tenderness"), inconsistent tone, and overgeneralized emotional states suggest formulaic AI patterns rather than organic invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially incorporated rather than meaningfully integrated. Breveity amplifies structural weaknesses, with conceptual ambitions outpacing execution. Fails to leverage constraints for thematic potency.</comment>
