<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but unapologetic timidity lacks tangible manifestation; actions align with collective healing but internal conflict remains underexplored. Subtle use of sewing as metaphor for community mending stands out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong arc from arrival to tapestry completion, but transitions between temple exploration and scoreboard discovery feel compressed; vintage ribbon's integration smoothens structural jumps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Struggles to fully realize "scattered harmony" tone; atmospheric details like healing hums and faded ribbon are evocative but unevenly sustained throughout the temple's hybrid architecture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose achieves thematic resonance (stitching as healing) but occasionally veers into abstraction; subtext about communal unity is present but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by slightly formulaic elements (arcade scoreboard feels contrived); vivid descriptions of tapestry-weaving avoid purple prose but some metaphors (serpent-shaped ribbon) border on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Polished and conceptually intriguing but lacks narrative audacity; high lyricism compensates for occasionally mechanical integration of assigned elements, resulting in competent but untranscendent work.</comment>
