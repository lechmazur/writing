<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually stated but lack psychological depth or believable contradictions; actions feel arbitrarily assigned rather than organically connected to traits; "mundanely terrifying" attribute inconsistently manifested through both cosmic schemes and trivial objects without thematic cohesion</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows assembly-line logic of "gather symbols → create lullaby → cause chaos" with undifferentiated progression; cause-effect between sticky notes and cosmic effects remains unconvincing; repetitive actions undermine pacing within word constraints; beginning/middle/end arc feels algorithmically formulaic rather than narratively earned</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on recycled mythological shorthand ("yggdrasil," "nightmares") without concrete sensory reality; tonal dissonance between "mundanely terrifying" and cosmic grandiosity creates narrative whiplash; lacks tactile details to ground high-concept setting in emotional resonance</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Emotional impact sabotaged by chronic telling over showing; overused clichéd metaphors ("whispers of ancient terrors," "tapestry of reality") without fresh imagery; theme of chaos vs creation buried under exposition; ending resolves nothing while asking for portentous contemplation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Wallpaper dystopia aesthetic with zero original worldbuilding; repetitive "cosmic/mundane" contrasts function as mechanical tics rather than thematic exploration; sentence-level diction alternates between pseudo-poetic overload and empty cadence; feels assembled from genre Mad Libs template</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than in concert - fabric scrap symbolism, sticky note puzzles, and nightmare physics never intersect meaningfully; style obscures substance through verbose circumlocution; fails to transform constraints into narrative advantages, leaving conceptual gaps</comment>
