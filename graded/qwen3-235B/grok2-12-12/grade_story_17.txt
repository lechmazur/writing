<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eliza’s guilt and motivation are present but underdeveloped; her transformation feels abrupt, with insufficient emotional nuance or distinct voice to anchor psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strained by compressed pacing; the incantation’s mystical mechanics lack clarity, while the flashbacks and resolution feel disconnected from the constrained setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but superficial; sensory details (candlelight, herbs) enhance mood but fail to deepen thematic or character connections to the setting’s surreal elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Limited emotional resonance; symbolism (chipped bowl) hints at redemption but leans on generic tropes rather than subtext or layered storytelling to convey transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Formulaic structures (witch’s intervention, abrupt redemption) dominate; language avoids cliché but lacks precision in metaphors and underdeveloped subtext, suggesting mechanical execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements feel imposed rather than organic; the framework constrains cohesion, with shallow integration of assigned components (e.g., “morning walks” irrelevant to the narrative).</comment>
