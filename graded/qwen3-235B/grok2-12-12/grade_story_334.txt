<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Arin's overconfidence and ambition are established but lack nuanced development; his sudden realization is abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work but feel rushed—tight pacing undermines emotional resonance, though the arc from discovery to sacrifice is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setting is underutilized; atmospheric details ("humming machines") hint at mystery but fail to deeply immerse or meaningfully connect to the character's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Thematic contrast between ambition and responsibility is clear, but emotional impact is diluted by predictable metaphors ("thunderbolt," "delicate harmony") and telegraphed moralizing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on sci-fi clichés (parallel selves, reality tears) without subversion; prose is functional but contains generic phrases ("thrill of discovery") that lack individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are ticked off but not seamlessly integrated; premise intrigues, but shallow exploration of themes and rushed resolution limit cohesion and lingering impact.</comment>
