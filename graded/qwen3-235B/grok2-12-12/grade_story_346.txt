<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Boastfulness is surface-level trait; minimal behavioral development or motivation consistency. Transformation lacks emotional weight or nuanced execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Circular structure relies too heavily on perfunctory "escape-then-reflect" arc. Rewiring action feels narratively inert despite attempts at manufactured tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Clashing imagery (wasp nest vs. balloon pops) creates tonal dissonance rather than cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details overwhelm subtler worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Potent phrases ("precise madness") outweigh shallow thematic execution. Ending's philosophical claims lack earned narrative foundation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (captive hero, reality illusion) with superficial modernist flourishes. Purple prose undermines otherwise inventive metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formal cohesion exists but emotional/philosophical impact remains hollow. Assigned elements present but unevenly integrated.</comment>
