<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but lacks depth; motivations feel imposed rather than organically revealed through action. Internal conflict of "doubtfully confident" is stated, not demonstrated through behavior or decision-making. Emotional transformation occurs too abruptly without psychological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks narrative momentum. Action progression feels contrived - humming a song to restore light requires greater buildup. Cause-and-effect lacks conviction; the council's authorization serves as hollow exposition rather than active plot catalyst. Too many unanswered questions about world rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting functions as decorative backdrop rather than atmospheric engine. Sensory details rely on clich√©d metaphors ("morning sun," "river breaking dam") rather than specific lived experience. The courtyard's calligraphic elements are underexploited as both physical and symbolic space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Attempts to use literary devices fall into formulaic patterns. "Harsh tenderness" lacks contextual grounding. The tapestry's revival feels teleological rather than earned. Thematic message about potential emerges too neatly; subtext is drowned by expository statements about "shackles" and "spark."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Language veers between pretentious abstraction and mechanical phrasing. The phrase "doubtfully confident" is paradoxically clever but becomes narrative crutch. Emotional journey follows predictable redemptive arc without authentic struggle. The tapestry's "glowing" colors exemplifies unearned magical realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than inherently connected. The traditional song method appears contrived; would any cultural element serve similar function? Short format fails to compensate for thematic density. The ending's "newfound resolve" smacks of algorithmic closure rather than narrative necessity.</comment>
