<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (upside of loss) is conceptually present but remains abstract; Eli's trapper identity lacks tangible impact on his actions or emotional depth beyond thematic lip service.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on sea glass as catalyst, but the transition from doubt to revelation feels schematic; compressed arc works within constraints, yet cause-effect logic between radiance siphoning and decoded microfilm patterns remains vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" manifests visually but inconsistently in tone; salvaged materials and cosmic juxtapositions create atmosphere, but sensory immersion beyond sight (e.g., ambient noise of machinery, tactile coldness of glass) is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sea glass as symbol elevates the narrative; metaphors (doubt-as-potential) and circular structure (observing loss becoming observing possibility) create resonant thematic layers, though emotional engagement is undercut by occasional exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging sci-fi with abstract existentialism, but "silently audible" and "black hole of doubt" border on pretentious abstraction; character psychology feels calculated rather than visceral, leaning into clich√©s of solitary introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements cohesively but superficially; the central metaphor succeeds, yet the narrative remains intellectually stimulating over viscerally engaging, lacking the transcendent clarity of truly distinctive work.</comment>
