<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's "unjustly fair" apothecary skills and love for butterflies are central but underexplored; motivations feel imposed rather than organically revealed through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but suffers from abrupt transitions, particularly the leap to interpreting butterfly flight as Morse code; resolution feels rushed within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine atmosphere is vividly sketched with sensory details (hissing steam, brass portholes) but lacks deeper integration with the conceptual duality of "battered marvel" and fragile ecosystems.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is undermined by overly explicit thematic statements ("bathe the world in understanding"); metaphors like "battered marvel" hint at depth but remain superficially rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by clich√©d phrasing ("world teetering on collapse") and underdeveloped mechanics: butterfly-Morse code logic feels arbitrary, not imaginatively justified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion falters under the weight of assigned elements; while steampunk setting and apothecary skills are seamlessly woven, the Morse code gimmick and "unjustly fair" trait feel imposed rather than organic.</comment>
