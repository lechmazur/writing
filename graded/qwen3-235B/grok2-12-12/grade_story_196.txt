<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is defined by contradictions ("fiercely apathetic") but lacks psychological depth; motivation stated but not sufficiently dramatized through action or choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear circular structure (stillness to action) but relies on underdeveloped cause-effect chains; meteor showers as plot devices feel narratively convenient rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere achieved through sparse, poetic descriptions but setting remains conceptually shallow; floating monastery's uniqueness doesn't intrinsically shape character or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (meteors as guides, spark as defiance) elevate the narrative; ending resonates with poetic inevitability but lacks emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combines familiar fantasy tropes with some fresh imagery; avoids overt clich√©s but lacks subversive reinterpretation; language balances clarity with occasional pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy; brevity enhances poetic tone while constraining narrative depth; conceptually intriguing but emotionally distant.</comment>
