<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Presents a clear, archetypal figure with stated motivations but lacks psychological nuance or tangible character evolution. Assigned traits like "authentically artificial demeanor" remain descriptive rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Relies on circular structure and static observation rather than dynamic progression. Clear logic but minimal narrative tension or resolution within constraints. Begins and ends with similar reflective stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Evocative setting juxtapositions (desert/space) but lacks specific sensory immersion. Atmosphere leans heavily on abstract poeticism rather than visceral worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Employs symbolic constellations and universal themes with surface-level effectiveness. Subtext about meaning-making exists but lacks emotional penetration or memorable stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Blends unexpected elements (desert wanderer/space pirates) with moderate originality, but relies on vaguely mystical phrasing rather than concrete imagery. Avoids overt clich√©s while leaning on abstract thematic comfort zones.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coherent conceptual framework weakened by thin execution. Elements feel tangentially connected rather than organically integrated, creating philosophical pretension over meaningful cohesion.</comment>
