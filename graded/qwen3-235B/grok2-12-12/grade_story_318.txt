<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks evolutionary depth; the wooden spoon's connection to past lacks visceral specificity; the 'halfhearted' trait resolves too neatly, undermining emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses through repetitive symbolic gestures; lullaby translation method feels contrived. Pacing stumbles between exposition and resolution within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory crystals provide visual intrigue but underutilize sensory potential. Gloomy cheerfulness permeates atmosphere, though spatial logic remains nebulous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lullabies evoke nostalgia but emotional payoff remains surface-level. Metaphors (crystals, spoons) feel intentional yet lack layered subtext; resolution adheres to safe literary conventions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual elements merge inventively but execution veers into abstract vagueness. Some generic descriptors ('warm light') dilute psychological specificity; metaphors occasionally border on decorative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Element integration demonstrates craftsmanship but lacks audacious cohesion. The lullaby method feels tacked-on rather than organic. Style leans toward polished safety rather than risk-taking.</grade>
