<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear (Lila’s devotion, old man’s curiosity) but lack deeper development; interactions feel surface-level despite emotional premise. Dialogue lacks distinct voice beyond generic gravity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot flows from encounter to song but feels rushed; karaoke duet resolution is abrupt and under-explained. Closure is present but underdeveloped for the emotional weight promised.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hourglass setting is imaginative but underutilized; sensory details are minimal and generic (“cacophony,” “blithe discontent” without vivid examples). Atmosphere contrasts poorly with the emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story achieves modest emotional impact through the pencil sharpener’s symbolism and theme of legacy. Subtext about truth is clear but not deeply layered; dialogue occasionally stilted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality in the hourglass setting and karaoke duet is undercut by formulaic emotional beats (“twinkling eyes,” “weight lifted”) and overused metaphors (sands of time). Writing occasionally veers into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but strained; assigned elements feel forced (karaoke duet, hourglass) rather than integrated. The ending lingers emotionally but lacks structural innovation.</comment>
