<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but lacks layered motivations or humanizing flaws; actions rarely reveal complexity beyond thematic symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Virtually no plot progression; static loops of symbolic gestures substitute for narrative momentum; the "arc" is a circle, not a structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visually competent setting description (peeling paint, broken chairs) creates mood, but sensory immersion remains superficial beyond visual decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (distortions as propaganda) undercut by excessive exposition; theme resonates but lacks surprising emotional subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</question><comment>Relies on vigilante/mentor tropes; "screaming silence" concept executed predictably; metaphors and descriptors verge on overwrought clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements superficially connect thematically but lack narrative urgency; brevity feels limiting rather than intentional; ideas linger more than emotional impact.</comment>
