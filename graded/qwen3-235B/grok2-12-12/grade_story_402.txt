<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited psychological depth; motivation (archiving seasons) drives action but lacks emotional resonance. Sign language as communication method only superficially explored. "Visibly obscure" trait shapes visual portrayal but not inner complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Contained arc but static progression; raft's motion mirrors internal state but lacks concrete narrative stakes or conflict resolution. Metaphorical parallel between releasing bottle and character's journey well-structured within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through gothic surrealism (bones/tree roots) and existential vastness (water reflecting unknown). "Luminous doubt" manifests via light/shadow contrasts. Sensory details strong but narrowly focused on visual/thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powers of metaphor (bottle as message to future, catacombs as preserved memory) create lasting impact. Subtext about human legacy amid impermanence. Stylistic rhythm mimics drifting motion, enhancing immersion and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard concept original but execution occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction. Recurring phrases ("silent communication," "luminous doubt") verge on clich√©. Motivation and symbols tied tightly to plot but emotional authenticity occasionally undermined by aestheticized descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively with minimal waste; brevity enhances meditative tone rather than limitations. Thematic consistency on cyclical time and human transience. Would require sharper emotional edge for top-tier distinction, but succeeds as compact literary artifact.</comment>
