<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elaborate but superficial characterization; traits are explicitly stated rather than organically demonstrated through action. Character reactions lack psychological depth despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc compressed awkwardly into limited space; pivotal transformations feel abbreviated. Plot progression relies excessively on exposition rather than dramatic tension or stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually vivid but emotionally static setting; "psychedelic" descriptors overwhelm without purposeful sensory integration. Contrasts between revelry and isolation are conceptually strong but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery elevates thematic resonance, but overuse of abstract emotional language undermines impact. Empathy theme emerges clearly but lacks narrative complication or ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mix of fresh metaphors ("cracked compass") with formulaic expressions ("pulsing colors"). Tone occasionally feels artificially imposed rather than emerging from character or action. Overly consistent lyrical register reduces emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent integration of assigned elements without transcendent originality. Concepts serve plot functionality but lack existential urgency. Ambitious themes remain under-interrogated by narrative mechanisms.</comment>
