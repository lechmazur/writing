<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "rationally impulsive" trait lacks concrete behavioral demonstration; motivations are stated but inconsistently embodied through actions. Emotional depth relies on symbolic objects rather than nuanced internal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is conventional, with resolving a cold case feeling mechanically inserted. The arc from preparation to performance is coherent but strained by abrupt thematic shifts toward mystery-solving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually evocative but thinly textured; the post-oil palace's decay-and-hope duality is undermined by minimal engagement with sensory elements beyond sight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (sunlight, doll’s dress) and cyclical structure enhance thematic resonance, though emotional impact leans on familiar symbolism rather than subversive originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends lyrical prose with clichéd emotional cues. Some phrases ("anxious serenity") feel contrived; the intersection of cold-case-solving and performance art remains under-explored beyond surface connections.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Element integration is adequate but not seamless. The tight word limit highlights structural gaps (e.g., solving mysteries), though the meditative tone lingers conceptually.</comment>
