<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels constrained by word limits; transformation arc is clear, though pacing stumbles in balancing action with introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Radiant sensory contrasts (gray vs. color) create mood, but the post-apocalyptic setting lacks tangible details to fully immerse readers in its harshness or beauty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly weighted; the premise lingers conceptually, yet structural and tonal imbalances prevent lasting literary impact.</comment>
