<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's amiable nature is stated rather than demonstrated; motivation to fuse lore/dreams is clear but lacks internal conflict; actions solving crossword don't reveal nuanced personality; distinct "voice" absent in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has basic causality (crossword completion triggers climax) but feels rushed; beginning/end connection is superficial; pacing uneven with abrupt vibrations/light; assigned concepts shape plot mechanically rather than organically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse's eerie atmosphere is present but generic; sensory details (flickering light, vibrations) lack specificity; ship's timbers' connection to crosswords remains symbolic rather than functional; tone doesn't deepen theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphors (glowing letters, shadows) effectively but superficially; ending feels resolved rather than resonant; theme of bridging past/future is present but surface-level; lacks tension showing rather than telling emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Predictable "haunted lighthouse" trope; vibrating timbers feel like AI-generated plot device; overly precise descriptors ("dimly lit," "eerie atmosphere") lack originality; emotional beats stated rather than earned; inconsistent handling of "humble rebellion" tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements included but cohesively strained; story feels built around checklist rather than organic necessity; style is competent but forgettable; brevity highlights gaps in character/logic; leaves minimal lingering impact.</comment>
