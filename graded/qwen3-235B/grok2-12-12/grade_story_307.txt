<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters are archetypal and symbolic rather than complex individuals; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth or evolution. The protagonist functions primarily as a conduit for thematic ideas.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a simple heroic arc, but the condensed narrative sacrifices nuance for symbolic resolution; pacing resolves tensions too neatly, diminishing emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details and atmospheric contrasts (ethereal vs. gritty) create immersive mood; the setting actively shapes the thematic concerns and character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor and imagery, but emotional impacts are often telegraphed rather than earned. The ending provides symbolic closure but lacks narrative richness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Predictable tropes dominate (e.g., magical mentor, redemption arc). Language occasionally verges on poetic but risks cliché; subtext fails to deepen the surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but result in a parable-like simplicity rather than literary sophistication. The story’s message is clear but lacks layered complexity for elite publication.</comment>
