<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation to map railways is mentioned but not deeply connected to his actions; 'honesty' as a core concept feels imposed rather than organically tied to his behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear structure connects past and present coherently, but the link between measuring echoes and the story's emotional core is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like buzzing air and metallic echoes create mood, but the 'radio wave garden' lacks concrete physicality, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., echoes as life shaped by honesty) are conceptually interesting but superficially executed; the ending feels poetic but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on abstract, occasionally vague imagery; some phrases (e.g., "despairing cheer") feel forced rather than naturally explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist without seamless integration; the abrupt focus shifts (hairbrush, railways, echoes) suggest strain rather than cohesion in the short form.</comment>
