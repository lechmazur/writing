<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (prophecy reversal) but feels surface-level; accidental heroism isn’t organically integrated into Mira’s decisions, instead serving as a label rather than a dynamic trait. Her connection to the puzzle box reveals anxiety more than depth of character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels rushed—cliff ascent and sanctuary discovery lack tension despite tight word limits. Cause/effect relationships are logical but predictable; prophecy resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on sensory details (“sharp gentleness”) for immersion but lacks uniqueness in setting—the seashell and beach blend generic fantasy tropes. The “camouflaged walls” hint at ingenuity but aren’t vividly realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Storytelling is competent but unremarkable—ritual ending evokes temporary emotional resonance, but lacks subtext or fresh perspective. Writing style is functional but overly reliant on passive phrasing (“the air shimmers”) rather than active imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overused tropes (cursed prophecy, puzzle-solving hero) dominate. “Sharp gentleness” reads as dissonant cliché rather than evocative tone. Reversed wishes lack narrative innovation, feeling like a checklist item rather than a thematic cornerstone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not tightly interwoven—e.g., the seashell’s purpose feels arbitrary. The brief length highlights pacing issues more than intentional minimalism. Lingering impact is slight, tied mostly to the resolved prophecy.</comment>
