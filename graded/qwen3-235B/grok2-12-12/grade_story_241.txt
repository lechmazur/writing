<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; guide's "soft-voiced" trait exists nominally without influencing interactions. Narrator's zeal motivation emerges abruptly without psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>No plot structure - merely descriptive drifting. Inciting incident (different train) has no narrative consequences. No resolution or transformation, only vague "journey begun" abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric when concrete ("misty cloud table"), but collapses under scrutiny ("walls shifting" without purpose). Sensory details like music exist but feel decorative rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vague metaphor-heavy prose ("scream of silent plains") fails to resonate. Attempts at "deeper meaning" remain unearned conceptualizing rather than visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Textbook case of purple prose: "blissful agony," "tangible energy," "tapestry of meaning." Overwrought adjectives substitute for authentic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolation: cafe, blackout, vest - none create cohesive narrative. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful, with ideas abandoned before development.</comment>
