<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character remains a cipher; motivations are stated but not deeply explored. Assigned traits (analytically free) lack manifestation in actions or decision-making. No distinct voice or emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Basic arc exists but feels perfunctory—too much is crammed into limited space. Pacing rushes from discovery to revelation without meaningful beats. Thematic connection between beginning and end is vague rather than cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative in fragments (dust, machinery echoes) but inconsistent. Sensory details are generic; setting’s connection to the play’s final bow and "wilderness wisdom" feels forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and transformation imagery competently but lacks emotional resonance. Central conflict (defying finality) exists abstractly but fails to generate tension or provoke deeper philosophical engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (mystical goggles, abandoned workshops) with minimal subversion. Phrases like "prickly wonder" and "wilderness wisdom" feel derivative. Overly ornate descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Moments of poetic language but overall execution lacks urgency or depth. Elements feel grafted together rather than organically integrated. Short length emphasizes structural weaknesses rather than elevating concision.</comment>
