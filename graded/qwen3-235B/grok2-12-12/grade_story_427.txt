<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation stated but lacks depth; mechanical arm's role feels arbitrary rather than reflecting internal conflict or personality. Actions serve plot over character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows structure but feels rushed; deconstruction of sock drives narrative but lacks tension/resolution progression. Pacing uneven in brief window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse setting vague and underutilized; atmosphere relies on abstract descriptors rather than sensory immersion. Object-setting relationships superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Symbols (sock, shifting equilibria) lack emotional resonance; writing leans on repetitive abstraction over subtext. Ending feels like placeholder for longer narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stilted phrases ("coded desperation") and overused abstraction suggest formulaic construction. Emotional logic feels algorithmic, not organic. Purple prose undermines thematic focus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements present but haphazardly fused; story feels like checklist fulfillment. Themes undeveloped, style overshadows clarity. Lacks cohesive purpose or lasting impression.</comment>
