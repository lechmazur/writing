<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal - motivations stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions. Dialogue absent, internal thoughts feel generic. "Zealousness" shown through action but lacks idiosyncratic voice or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to revelation to resolution too mechanically. The transformation from finding nail to cosmic sign feels rushed. Effective use of circular structure but lacks meaningful middle tension. Cause-effect chain exists but feels predetermined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting exists primarily as concept rather than tactile reality - minimal sensory engagement beyond "cloud watching" and "pulsing star". Atmosphere attempts mystical tone but insufficiently sustained through concrete details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolic resonance of rusted nail/time capsules works well. Ending's cosmic alignment provides emotional uplift but lacks narrative surprise. Shows more craft than emotional depth; metaphorical potential remains partially unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mixes fresh cosmic imagery with clich√©d revolution tropes. Time capsule concept feels derivative rather than inventive. Language occasionally slips into poetic abstraction that dilutes impact. Contains moments of originality but insufficient subversion of expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than coalesce into unified whole. Style maintains clarity but lacks stylistic daring. Brief length handled competently but doesn't transform constraints into creative advantage. Leaves questions rather than profound lingering impact.</comment>
