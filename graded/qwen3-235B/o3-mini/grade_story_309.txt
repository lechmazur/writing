<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations stated rather than demonstrated. Lack of concrete actions or decisions undermines depth. Sarcasm and uncertainty feel superficial rather than embedded in behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward motion. Internal monologue dominates without consequential events. Fragmentary structure resists coherence, making the word limit feel like a constraint rather than a deliberate choice.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative but shallow atmosphere. Abstract art and shadows create mood, but sensory details are generalized rather than specific. Vanishing Point Gallery remains underexploited as a symbol or setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Overstuffed with metaphors that cancel each other. Emotional impact diluted by excessive ornamentation. Fails to balance poetic language with meaningful subtext or thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on noir tropes (haunted detective, labyrinth memories) without subversion. Language veers between overly formal and clichéd ("kaleidoscope of cracked memories"). Emotional nuance absent, replaced by forced ironies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but haphazardly assembled. Writing style prioritizes abstraction over clarity, weakening cohesion. Leaves neither lingering questions nor insights—merely confusion about narrative intent.</comment>
