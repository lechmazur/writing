<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot prioritizes atmospheric vignettes over coherent progression; lever-triggered "ritual" lacks narrative consequence; cause-effect relationships obscured by poetic tangents; pacing muddied by excessive lyrical digressions within limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Evocative carnival descriptions undercut by inconsistent coastal elements; sensory details often beautiful but occasionally dissonant; atmosphere supports character's introspective tone but setting components fail to unify meaningfully.</comment>
