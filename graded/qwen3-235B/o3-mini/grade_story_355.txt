<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and "harsh compassion" remain abstract thematic descriptors rather than lived traits; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through concrete actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meandering structure prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum, but the progression from post-celebration disillusionment to legacy-building maintains minimal coherence through recurring motifs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Exquisite language cannot compensate for underdeveloped character logic and diffuse narrative purpose; ambition outstrips execution in this conceptual mosaic.</comment>
