<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks coherent motivation; personality traits (spirit, gracefulness, awkwardness) are stated, not demonstrated, with no meaningful internal logic connecting them to actions. No distinct voice or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Plot fragments lack causality and resolution. Assigned actions/concepts are superficially embedded in disconnected vignettes, ignoring narrative momentum and reader orientation. No discernible arc or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Setting is a jumble of surreal clich√©s ("bones as dining tables") without tactile specificity. Atmosphere is tonally incoherent (e.g., gourmet restaurant haunted by "nightmares"), with hollow sensory descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Relies on overwritten metaphors and empty phrases ("cadence of reinterpretation") without emotional authenticity. No subtext, inconsistent focus, or thematic payoff; ending lacks narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Formulaic diction ("harsh tenderness"), redundant descriptors, and melodramatic tropes suggest AI-driven conventions. Overwrought prose obscures character nuance or thematic rigor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Elements are enumerated, not integrated. Style prioritizes ornamental abstraction over clarity, coherence, or reader engagement. No evidence of artistic vision or editorial control.</comment>
