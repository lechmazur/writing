<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete actions or clear motivations, existing as a metaphoric cipher rather than a person; inner turmoil and vows remain abstract, with no discernible arc or development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Nonexistent plot structure; atmospheric fragments replace narrative progression, with no beginning-middle-end coherence or cause-effect logic within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Rich but disconnected imagery creates mood without purpose; celestial and cosmic details overwhelm functional world-building, failing to anchor abstract motifs in tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Occasional vivid metaphors (e.g., laughter "echoing via a spider’s web") contrast with excessive ornamentation; lacks emotional resonance or thematic clarity to elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on overused poetic formulas ("spider’s web after rain") and artificial eloquence; repetitive flourishes suggest algorithmic defaults rather than intentional style or subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolation, never coalescing; the prose prioritizes aesthetic ostentation over narrative cohesion, leaving no lasting impression beyond detached phrases.</comment>
