<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond whimsical descriptors; motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Reactions to objects (brass knocker, archives) are symbolic but emotionally vague. No distinct narrative voice to anchor introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of loosely connected atmospheric moments; no clear causal chain. Kinesthetic method and AI timeframe lack narrative payoff. Pacing veers between stagnant and abrupt, typical of impressionistic indulgence without structural rigor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Detailed sensory inventory (echoes, brass sheen, archival sounds) creates evocative layers, but the post-AI setting feels like a conceptual prop rather than integrated reality. Atmospheric coherence occasionally overwhelms functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</comment>Over-reliance on abstract juxtaposition (hope vs doubt, art vs machine) substitutes for earned emotional gravity. Some haunting imagery (compassion as flickering light, decentralised billboards) but thematic delivery feels didactic rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Heavy on formulaic poetic devices (personification of intangibles, clich√©d symbolism) and ornate metaphors. The "absent-minded brewer" trope reads algorithmically generated, lacking idiosyncratic humanity in characterization and narrative cadence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Elements incorporated mechanically rather than organically; the story feels constructed *around* requirements rather than exploring them. Lingering impression is aesthetic pretension over substantive narrative or thematic innovation.</comment>
