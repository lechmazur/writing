<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "mild fervor" and "small-time con artist" are mentioned but remain superficial; motivations for confronting ghosts feel internally contradictory and lack grounding in concrete actions or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum and logical progression; fragmented vignettes replace cause-effect relationships, while disjointed pacing undermines any sense of resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Setting is underdeveloped and tonally inconsistent—dystopian elements clash with vague "unusually normal" details; sparse sensory description fails to immerse or meaningfully contextualize the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sporadic effective metaphors (tape as confession device) contrast with overwritten prose; themes of remorse are hinted at but drowned out by abstract language, leaving emotional impact diluted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on clichéd ghostly redemption arcs and overwritten descriptors ("relentless dialogues," "transient nature of schemes") while uneven pacing and repetitive phrasing suggest algorithmic defaults rather than purposeful voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elements feel arbitrarily connected; overly ornate style obscures narrative clarity, and brevity works against deeper exploration of theme or character, leaving the story feeling unfinished rather than purposeful.</comment>
