<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and vague; "dry-witted" label contradicts melancholic actions. Motivations (learning traditional methods, preserving secrets) conflict without psychological depth. No distinct voice or internal logic unites contradictory impulses. Memories of lost partner inconsistently tied to actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal chain - confiscating diary arbitrarily segues into dance recollections. Timeframe and ending feel disconnected. Flashbacks interrupt momentum without clear purpose. "Reckless precision" inconsistently demonstrated - tone fluctuates between lyrical and procedural without cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Eerie lighthouse setting has vivid descriptions but atmospheric elements (creaking floors, storm) remain decorative rather than symbolically integrated. Sensory details (whispering gusts, cold stone) create mood but rarely deepen emotional stakes or thematic concerns about impermanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overused metaphors about erosion and dancing drown out unique voice. Attempts at symbolic resonance (diary as unkept promises) feel manufactured rather than organic. Ending's "silent waltz" gestures at thematic closure but lacks earned emotional weight. Confiscation as central action remains under-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies on gothic clich√©s (haunted lighthouse, stormy seas) with no subversion. Recurring phrases about eroding promises border on self-parody. Purple prose ("graceful act symbolizing unyielding renewal") prioritizes ornamentation over clarity. Sudden emotional shifts mirror algorithmic pattern-following rather than human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist rather than organic components - dance, lighthouse keepers, and frayed rope connections feel imposed. Conceptual framework (vows, methods) creates artificial structure rather than narrative momentum. Haunting tone lacks specificity to linger beyond surface descriptions.</comment>
