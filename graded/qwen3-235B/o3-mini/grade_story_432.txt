<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (mapping energy flows) contradicts death wish without exploring the paradox. Actions remain abstract; no distinct voice emerges despite poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward motion—episodic descriptions substitute for structure. The ice sculpture timeframe is repeatedly mentioned but never integrates into cause-effect or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details (waterfall sounds, dripping chandeliers), but the setting’s grandeur feels disconnected from the protagonist’s internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Imagery is lush but hollow—subtext about binding cosmic truths never crystallizes. The ending feels ritualistic but bereft of emotional resonance or thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive, generic ornateness (“serene upheaval,” “cryptic symbols”) borders on parody. Sudden shifts (ice sculpture, cloaked figures) suggest formulaic transitions; metaphors lack surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel, not cohesion. The brevity works against depth—fragmented imagery overwhelms any lingering impact or unifying theme.</comment>
