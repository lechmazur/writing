<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations and traits are abstractly stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; psychological complexity and emotional depth lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression; beginning and end are conceptually aligned but disconnected by meandering, static descriptions instead of coherent cause-effect mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is inconsistently rendered - generic cosmic desolation contrasts weakly with the odd specificity of a butter churn; insufficient sensory anchoring to make the setting vivid or thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Occasional effective imagery ("chill of endless space merge with warmth of rebellious sparks") undermined by overreliance on abstract adjectives and thematic redundancy; lacks narrative substance beneath stylistic surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Pervasive purple prose hijacks storytelling; formulaic phrasing ("shimmered in the void"), repetitive structural patterns, and explicitly stated themes betray algorithmic writing tendencies rather than human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Cumulative elements create a vague metaphorical tapestry without narrative cohesion or philosophical rigor; stylistic excess obscures authorial vision and emotional engagement.</comment>
