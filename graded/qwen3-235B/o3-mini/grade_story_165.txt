<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice, internal conflict, or growth beyond stated gentleness; motivations are declared rather than embodied through nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot drifts between vignettes without clear stakes, progression, or resolution; lacks cause-effect logic and tightening under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid sensory details (e.g., "subterranean lanterns," crystalline stream), but setting rarely drives the narrative forward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Generative flourishes (e.g., "joyful terror") verge on clich√©; repetitive descriptors and formulaic phrasing undermine originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesive in texture but shallow thematically; prioritizes style over substance, leaving little resonance beyond surface beauty.</comment>
