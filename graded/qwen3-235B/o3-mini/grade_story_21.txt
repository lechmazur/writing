<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are hinted but lack concrete behavioral demonstrations; "measured diplomat" trait isn't organically manifested through specific actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; more a thematic mood piece than structured narrative; fragmented chronology obscures coherence within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective sensory details (must, drum rhythms) create immersive decay; atmosphere aligns with themes but physical setting's symbolic weight remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and layered themes (vengeance/redemption) present; overwritten prose occasionally distracts from emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (genetic research/fox tail symbolism) but repetitive phrasing and over-reliance on adverb-heavy descriptors weaken originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but lacks narrative urgency; elements feel cataloged rather than organically interwoven; doesn't exploit short form's compression potential.</comment>
