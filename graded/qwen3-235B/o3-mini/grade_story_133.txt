<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters feel archetypal rather than fully realized; motivations are stated but lack psychological depth or authentic contradictions. Miralda's menace remains superficial, while Elias's "jaded" nature manifests mostly through description rather than choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fairly coherent arc within constraints but overly reliant on thematic abstraction over concrete cause-and-effect. Pacing alternates between abrupt leaps (alliance formation) and stagnant lyricism. The pottery class encounter functions more as ornamental setting than driving plot mechanism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive setting with rich sensory textures. The rooftop labyrinth orchard enhances the mystery through tactile descriptions of vines, light, and materials. Atmosphere complements the theme of hidden truths but occasionally overshadows narrative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linguistically sophisticated with striking metaphors, but emotional resonance is diluted by excessive abstraction. Some memorable imagery (gloves as "secret inscriptions") strengthens thematic coherence. The ending feels more decorative than thematically conclusive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Struggles with purple prose (e.g., "twilight of revelation") and over-reliance on esoteric descriptors. Some tropes undercut originality ("mystical realm heir"). Metaphors often prioritize ornamentation over clarity. Character psychology occasionally feels algorithmically conventional rather than lived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesive enough through shared themes of preservation and legacy but uneven in execution. Assigned elements create friction in narrative flow; the story sometimes reads as checklist fulfillment rather than organic creation. Lingering questions about purpose rather than emotional resonance.</comment>
