<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Abstract musings dominate over genuine character psychology; motivations around "elimination" and "non-violence" are stated rather than dramatized through concrete actions; lack of distinct voice or psychological progression beneath poetic surface</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Meandering collection of vignettes with disconnected chronology; episodic structure undermines narrative drive; circular descriptions replace plot progression; subway stops and parties function as arbitrary scene transitions rather than causal developments</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric but incoherent world-building; haunted attic and midnight setting effectively rendered through sensory details, but subway timeframe contradicts claustrophobic/urban atmosphere; tonal clashes between gothic elements and drunken parties create disjointed mood</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., "botanical samples as manifesto") elevate prose, but excessive abstract phrasing ("meticulously messy tapestry") dilutes emotional impact; ending sonnet feels thematically disconnected from earlier narrative; subtext about creation through elimination merits deeper exploration</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unconventional combinations (e.g., non-violence quest in haunted spaces), but overuses Gothic tropes in diluted form; metaphors like "whispers as lullabies" feel derivative rather than fresh; vocabulary occasionally veers into pretentious obfuscation without sufficient payoff</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but often decorative rather than structurally integral; attempts at thematic cohesion are undermined by inconsistent tone and weak throughlines; elevated language occasionally transcends constraints but more often becomes self-indulgent; brief length feels limiting rather than deliberate</comment>
