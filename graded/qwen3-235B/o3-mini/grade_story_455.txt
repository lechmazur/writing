<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Poorly developed character motivations; internal conflict lacks concrete rooting in assigned role or traits. Abstract descriptions don't translate to believable actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot direction exists but lacks cohesion. Pacing stumbles between vaguely connected metaphors rather than concrete events; beginning/middle/end distinction collapses under diffuse progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Superficial sensory details. Atmospheric potential undermined by vague descriptors; setting remains decorative rather than structurally integral through lack of tangible world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on metaphoric abstraction weakens emotional impact. Attempts at thematic depth through symbols (coins, scars) lack sufficient narrative grounding to resonate meaningfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Repetitive melodrama and hollow poeticism suggest formulaic construction. Tropes (redemption through suffering, symbolic artifacts) lack subversive depth or human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements included but unevenly integrated. Length limitations exacerbate disjointed synthesis rather than creating focused narrative efficiency.</comment>
