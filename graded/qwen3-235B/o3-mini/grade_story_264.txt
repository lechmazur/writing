<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character remains a stylized cipher; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or conflicts. Lacks distinct voice and psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot is static, lacking narrative progression or stakes. Relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than cause-and-effect. Resolution feels perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive with strong sensory details (projector hum, stained-glass sky), though the setting occasionally overwhelms story purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and subtextual tension between science/magic, but excessive abstraction dilutes emotional resonance and narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by overwrought prose and repetitive descriptors ("hauntingly cheerful," "infinite caution"). Sensory details lack specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stylish veneer barely conceals structural looseness. Elements feel decorative rather than integrated into a unified thematic argument.</comment>
