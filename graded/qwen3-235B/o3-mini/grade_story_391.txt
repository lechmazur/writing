<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relentless clich√©s ('tides of revolution,' 'whispers of wisdom'), redundant phrasing ('surging ideals' repeats thrice), and overwrought adjectives suggest algorithmic generation; no emotional subtext emerges from stated ideals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements included as checklist items rather than narrative necessities; linguistic flourishes conceal structural incoherence; brevity exacerbates lack of meaningful character-world interaction.</comment>
