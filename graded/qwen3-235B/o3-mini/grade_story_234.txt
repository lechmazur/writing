<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations (unfaithfulness, xenophilia, late blooming) referenced but not dramatized; actions lack causal connection to traits, relying on descriptors over behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>No clear narrative arc; events drift without stakes or progression; structure prioritizes atmosphere over plot mechanics, leaving closure unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory details (moonlight, silence) and symbolic spatial arrangement; setting functions as a character but risks overshadowing plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</comment><comment>Stylized prose dazzles but lacks emotional penetration; themes of existential longing implied through metaphors but remain unfocused, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</comment><comment>Relies on ornate abstraction ("silent poetry of lost worlds") and clich√©d paradoxes ("faithfully unfaithful") without fresh insight; rhythm feels calculated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion compromised by ornamental prose; elements serve aesthetics over narrative function despite ambitious thematic framework.</comment>
