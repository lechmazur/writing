<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth or evolving motivation; traits are abstract descriptors that don't fully cohere into a personable agent with relatable stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between atmospheric vignettes rather than a unified plot; pivotal connections between elements (e.g., lunchbox revelation) feel underdeveloped within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative but self-indulgent descriptions create atmosphere while obscuring tangible world-rules; sensory details overload without grounding emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery-heavy prose aims for mystical resonance but sacrifices narrative tension; thematic hints about connection/discovery remain superficially treated despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on ornate abstraction ("whispered confidences," "liminal moment") rather than concrete originality; metaphors feel recycled despite intricate packaging.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements operate as disconnected symbolic gestures rather than organic components; forced synecdoche between arcane objects and human themes undermines cohesion.</comment>
