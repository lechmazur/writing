<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; actions and motivations remain abstract and unconnected to tangible goals. Internal conflict and personality traits are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Narrative lacks clear beginning/middle/end structure; progression relies on repetitive imagery rather than cause-effect relationships. Word limit exacerbates disjointedness between abstract moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (decaying facility, whispered echoes) create immersive atmosphere. Melancholic tone through environmental decay and ritualistic actions effectively conveys thematic undertones of loss and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses poetic devices skillfully but superficially. Lacks emotional resonance; themes of rebirth through tradition remain abstract rather than emerging organically from character choices or consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Formulaic phrases ("crisp nostalgia," "indifferent stars") feel AI-generated. Repetitive descriptors ("gleefully morose," "whispered promises") create artificial depth without authentic emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist as checklist items rather than narrative drivers. Lyrical prose obscures hollow structural framework with aesthetic flourishes substituting for cohesive storytelling purpose.</comment>
