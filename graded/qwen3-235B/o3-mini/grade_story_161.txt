<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Thornwood’s traits feel arbitrarily assigned rather than organically developed. His vigilance and obsession with conspiracies dominate, but his identity as an "orchardist" adds no meaningful dimension. Motivations (personal tragedy, exposing conspiracies) are stated rather than demonstrated, lacking emotional texture or psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The plot loops rather than progresses: vignettes of Thornwood decoding paper airplanes repeat without escalation or revelation. Cause-effect logic is ambiguous, and the "resolution" merely reiterates established patterns. Tight word constraints expose a lack of structural intent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on overwrought descriptors ("flamboyant natural designs," "subtle, mocking parodies") rather than evocative specifics. The neon-lit facility and twilight corridors evoke a mood but lack visceral detail. The peacock’s tail and paper airplanes are symbolic but inconsistently grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery (paper planes as "enigmatic ciphers") and thematic hints about trauma and control are undercut by florid abstraction. The story leans on adjectives ("sardonic," "relentless") instead of earned emotional resonance. The ending feels rhetorically inflated, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rampant redundancy ("sardonic glee," "cryptic memories") and formulaic juxtapositions ("absurdity of inspecting flighted paper scraps as... destiny’s tokens") suggest algorithmic flourishes. Nuanced subtext is drowned out by relentless stylization; the tone circles self-parody rather than originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but rarely coalesce. The story’s ambition to fuse surreal intrigue and personal trauma is evident, but its execution feels like a collage of evocative fragments rather than a unified artifact. Lingering questions are vague, not purposeful.</comment>
