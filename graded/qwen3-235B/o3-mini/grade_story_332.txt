<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than psychologically complex; motivation feels imposed rather than organically revealed through action</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Meandering structure lacks clear progression; the arc exists only metaphorically, with tension between cosmic abstraction and emotional closure left underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ethereal setting rendered with vivid, original sensory details that deepen thematic concerns, though occasionally overwhelms narrative throughlines</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poetic devices create emotional texture, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; ending attempts profundity but sacrifices narrative specificity for vague hopefulness</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive abstract adjectives/contradictions ("fiercely gentle") and recycled metaphors ("canvas of the soul") veer into purple prose; inconsistent tone between mystical and personal registers</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack narrative necessity; the story reads as self-contained yet remains emotionally distant due to conceptual prioritization over human truth</comment>
