<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character's trait 'freelances everything' never demonstrated or connected to actions; motivation for chronicling elder wisdom stated but not dramatized or explored; reactions to objects/concepts remain abstract and detached from concrete behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks identifiable progression, conflict, or resolution; assigned action 'outwit' exists only as vague thematic aspiration; narrative arc nonexistent within limitations; cause-effect absent due to static, descriptive-only approach.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Steampunk setting features rich but disconnected sensory details; atmosphere of 'scattered harmony' partially conveyed through mechanical metaphors but fails to integrate with wedding timeframe or emotional stakes; tonal dissonance between elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Overly indulgent prose fails to evoke authentic emotional response; metaphors/similes repetitive/fatigued ('waves against a cliff'); subtext implied but superficial; ending lacks thematic resolution or earned insight; 'showing' via mechanics but devoid of human resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Relies on steampunk clich√©s, overworn oceanic metaphors, and abstract musing without deeper engagement; inconsistent emotional register with stilted tonal shifts; vocabulary excessively ornate yet emotionally vacant; narrative voids filled with stylistic filler rather than authentic creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Elements present but bolted-on rather than organically integrated; style actively obscures clarity; brief length amplifies structural deficiencies; no lingering impact beyond surface-level aesthetic; lacks evidence of purposeful design in element combination.</comment>
