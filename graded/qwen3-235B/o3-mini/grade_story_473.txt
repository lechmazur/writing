<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character development is surface-level; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through action or conflict. The eccentricity feels more like affectation than integral to personality. Emotional stakes are underdeveloped despite thematic references to burden and sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—lyrical passages clash with abrupt narrative jumps. Plot elements reference a "journey" but lack causal progression or resolution within the constrained form. Workshops and rituals feel episodic rather than structurally cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting is conceptually striking but thinly realized. Solar panels and urban orchard are atmospheric placeholders rather than active forces. Sensory details are generalized; tone leans on thematic adjectives ("bittersweet grit") rather than earned through concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Linguistic flourishes and metaphorical abstraction dominate over emotional resonance. The central tension between fate and agency remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Ending gestures toward resolution but lacks narrative weight or thematic specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on recursive, poetic phrasing creates a machine-generated rhythm. "Calculatedly unpredictable" and "bittersweet grit" are repeated without nuance. Emotional beats are stated rather than revealed through subtext; character psychology feels algorithmically derived rather than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are present but precariously balanced—remove any and the structure crumbles. The self-conscious literariness distracts from thematic exploration. The ending’s "silent victory" conclusion feels arbitrary rather than earned, undermining cohesion.</comment>
