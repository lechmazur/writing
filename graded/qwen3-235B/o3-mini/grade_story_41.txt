<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (defiance against expectation) is present but underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack psychological nuance; cameo brooch as ancestral symbol is insufficiently connected to tangible character decisions; cosmic powers remain abstract, never shaping concrete behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has symbolic arc but lacks causal momentum; cosmic reviews and ritual practices form repetitive backdrop rather than driving action; abrupt transition from ledger to flight lacks earned transformation; structural coherence undermined by diffuse pacing within limited word count; thematic throughline dominates over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are evocative but unevenly distributed (gargoyles/abyss recur superficially); setting functions primarily as metaphorical backdrop rather than lived environment; atmospheric tension between industrial and mystical elements remains underexploited; object-environment relationship (brooch/terrace) lacks organic interconnection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric density creates intellectual resonance but emotional distance; cosmic-aberration reviews as narrative device show craft but feel mannered; thematic consistency exists (destiny vs. agency) but lacks visceral grounding; ending functions symbolically rather than narratively satisfying; subtext dominates over concrete storytelling.</comment>
