<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Lacks concrete character, motivation, or voice. The astronomer exists as a vague symbol without distinct traits, inconsistent actions, or emotional authenticity. Mere mentions of ideals ("resolve") fail to create meaningful character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No coherent plot present. Fragmented vignettes replace narrative progression, with no cause-effect logic, discernible stakes, or resolution within the word limit. The "arc" is a loosely thematic thread, not a functional plot structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative but overloaded imagery creates atmospheric tension. While sensory details (shifting ice, crystal shadows) immerse readers, excessive abstraction risks detachment. The setting paradoxically anchors and destabilizes the story through stylization.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on superficial symbolism over emotional resonance. Literary devices (snowflake metaphors, cosmic motifs) feel decorative rather than revelatory. The ending functions as poetic repetition, not culmination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overly ornate language ("spectral glow of midnight") and clich√©d existential crises suggest formulaic abstraction. Phrases recycle metaphysical tropes without subversion, while inconsistent focus (idols, snowflakes, veils) undermines originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially adorn prose rather than fuel narrative cohesion. The story's maximalist style obscures thematic clarity, with the brief length emphasizing fragmentation rather than distilling purposeful complexity.</comment>
