<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations are implied but not fully explored. Quirks replace genuine personality. Actions don't culminate in meaningful transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lacks narrative propulsion; tension dissolves in abstraction. Plot fragments never coalesce into a satisfying arc. End feels arbitrarily appended, not earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich imagery without cohesion; sensory details dazzle but fail to build immersive reality. Setting's potential is undercut by uneven tone between whimsy and gravitas.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Visually striking but conceptually shallow. Metaphors overwhelm thematic clarity. Ending resolves nothing while raising unearned philosophical questions. Demonstrates technical flair over emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Distractingly mannered prose; excessive adjectives dilute impact. Sudden shifts in focus suggest algorithmic scaffolding. Attempts at originality often collapse into familiar fantastical tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically assembled. Style dominates substance, yet maintains marginal narrative cohesion. Falls short of transcending its constituent parts.</comment>
