<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's caution and determination are mentioned but not deeply demonstrated through actions; motivation for mapping cultural patterns ties to theme superficially, with limited emotional depth or nuanced inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through episodic scenes lacking a cohesive arc; beginning/end connections are abstract, pacing uneven with abrupt transitions between events; cause/effect relationships often implied rather than clearly structured.</comment>
