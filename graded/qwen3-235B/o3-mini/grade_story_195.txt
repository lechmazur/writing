<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character traits are abstract and symbolic but lack concrete actions or psychology; motivation is stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Meandering structure with no clear progression or resolution; cause-effect relationships are ambiguous beneath lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere evoked through repetitive sensory motifs but lacks visceral specificity; setting functions as a vague tableau rather than a dynamic world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Overwrought adjectives/adverbs dominate; clich√©d oppositions ("joyful sorrow," "serendipity vs. destiny") feel formulaic; repetitive phrasing suggests algorithmic patterning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially woven into lyrical abstraction but fail to create narrative urgency or thematic cohesion; prose prioritizes style over substance.</comment>
