<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth despite elaborate setup; motivations inferred through abstract actions but never fully embodied; voice remains overly stylized, obscuring individuality beneath ornate description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Rhythmic accumulation of poetic imagery replaces narrative progression; coherence sacrificed for atmospheric tension; pivotal actions (discovery of sandals, subversive revolution) lack causal momentum or consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungus and orchestra tuning create visceral, contradictory sensations; atmospheric detail overwhelms spatial logic; tone permeates setting but submerges plot in oppressive sensory overload.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose dazzles but distances; subtext about encoded resistance lingers, yet emotional connection eroded by relentless abstraction; ending feels inevitable, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avant-garde flourishes distinguish from generic speculative tropes; however, formulaic repetitions in sentence structure and excessive adjectival chains suggest mechanical amplification of "literary" affectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Visually compelling but structurally diffuse; thematic cohesion undercut by uneven integration of elements; style dominates substance, leaving intellectual resonance without visceral impact.</comment>
