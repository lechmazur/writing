<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's orphan status lacks depth; motivation is stated but not strongly embodied. Internal conflict insufficiently explored, though determination is consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but meanders; cause/effect are abstract. Pacing is uneven—some sections rushed, others linger. Resolution feels thematically complete but logically underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is surreal but inconsistent; gravitational anomaly contrasts with mundane setting without full integration. Sensory details are poetic but occasionally vague, weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (stones, anomaly) and theme of transformation, but relies heavily on abstraction. Emotional impact diluted by excessive lyrical description; central conflict remains internalized and diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("softly audible," "affectionate detachment"), overly stylized prose, and formulaic transitions suggest artificial construction. Conceptual elements feel underexplored despite attempts at subverting clichés.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but uneven; some elements enrich the narrative while others feel imposed. Style alternates between engaging and opaque. Leaves thematic echoes but lacks narrative urgency or distinct authorial voice.</comment>
