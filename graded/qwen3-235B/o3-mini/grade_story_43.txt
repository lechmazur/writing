<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is a collection of abstract descriptors lacking psychological depth; motivation (reconnection with courage) is stated but not dramatized through actions; "loudly introverted" trait remains superficial, never influencing decisions; no distinct narrative voice in third-person exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into atmospheric stasis; meandering movement lacks causal progression; no discernible conflict or stakes; cyclical imagery creates circularity rather than arc; pacing is simultaneously stagnant and rushed, with no resolution emerging from constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Neon cathedral offers vivid visuals but insufficient tactile/visceral details; fractured light/shadows motif is overworked; setting functions more as poetic conceit than lived space; disconnect between "post-human" timeframe and character's introspective focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on hollow metaphorical repetition ("crooked hope," "neon wonderland") that evokes nothing genuine; unsubstantiated claims about "ancient ballads" and "legends"; ending pretends profundity through vagueness; thematics are stated rather than embodied; confuses ornate description with emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Wallpaper-drenched prose with algorithmically generated "lyrical" phrases; generic descriptors ("whispering shadows," "pulsating glow") evoke no specific world; predictable AI "deep thought" structure of paradox-laden abstractions; metaphors function as decoration, not insight; emotional beats feel pre-programmed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel, not cohesion; narrative prioritizes aesthetic signifiers over meaningful integration; brevity feels imposed, not purposeful; fails to explore implications of "last human story"; superficial uniqueness masks trope-laden structure; leaves no intellectual or emotional residue.</comment>
