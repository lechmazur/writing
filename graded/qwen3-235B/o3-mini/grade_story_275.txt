<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's motivations are suggested but lack emotional depth; the hermit's theoretical rebelliousness feels abstract rather than manifesting in concrete actions or decisions that reveal psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of poetic images without clear causality or progression; the repetitive structure and lack of tangible development create a static quality that undermines coherence within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details are vivid and cohesive, particularly the burning comet's ominous presence, though sensory engagement remains narrowly visual without deeper environmental immersion to reinforce the "deliberate wilderness" tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes create intellectual resonance, but emotional impact remains muted; themes of rebellion through measured action offer conceptual depth that occasionally feels abstract rather than organically dramatized through character choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose contains striking metaphors but often defaults to ornate abstraction that distances the reader; the device of "exact angles" and "translations" risks algorithmic repetition, with imagery complexity feeling contrived rather than freshly imagined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are superficially unified but lack functional interconnection; the story prioritizes atmosphere over structured narrative, with the brevity feeling unintentional rather than purposefully condensed to achieve thematic intensity.</comment>
