<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits (hesitation, awkwardness) are stated but not consistently demonstrated through actions; motivation is present but generic, feeling more like a narrative directive than a lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a vague throughline but lacks clear progression; the word limit leads to underdeveloped cause-effect chains and a rushed, ambiguous resolution that feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant, with striking sensory contrasts between frost and heat, but setting elements occasionally border on excessive ornamentation rather than organic necessity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (hermit crabs, postcard) offer layered meaning and poetic ambition, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract distance; themes are clear but lack visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vocabulary is occasionally inventive but lapses into predictable abstractions ("ephemeral rancor," "fractured histories"); similes and motifs sometimes feel derivative despite flashes of original imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole but lean heavily on atmospheric vagueness rather than narrative precision; the ending hints at depth but doesn't fully crystallize the story's potential.</comment>
