<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters are defined more by descriptors than depth; motivation exists but lacks nuance and concrete actions to contextualize 'determined outlaw' or 'wistfully pragmatic'. No distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>No clear plot progression or resolution; repetitive descriptions substitute for narrative momentum. Browsing dominates without driving a cohesive arc within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on vague visual motifs (e.g., 'shimmer,' 'whispers') creates a flat, generic setting; sensory details lack differentiation or integration with character/plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Excessive clich√©d metaphors ('shimmer of possibility') and passive abstraction undermine emotional engagement; ending lacks thematic payoff or narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on ornate, repetitive phrasing and unearned contrasts ('earnest mockery'); lacks subversion of tropes or authentic emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements feel forcibly juxtaposed rather than interwoven; prose prioritizes style over clarity; fails to create lasting impact despite ambitious concepts.</comment>
