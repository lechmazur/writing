<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is abstract, motivations stated but not dramatized; "vague mystic" lacks psychological specificity, actions don't organically arise from traits, minimal voice distinctiveness</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure beyond impressionistic vignettes; circular progression, underdeveloped conflict between science/sorcery, arbitrary-seeming narrative waypoints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dichotomous settings (lab/attic) create conflicting sensory logics; atmosphere diluted by overreliance on incongruent descriptors like "artificially cultivated life forms" without concrete visualization</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasional vivid metaphors ("mosaic of futuristic visions") undercut by vague thematic signposting; attempts subtext with genetic innovation vs ancestral lore but execution feels schematic</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornamental prose ("humming corridors of ancestral memory") crosses into purple, repetitive abstractions ("forbidden futures," "ephemeral tapestry"), artificial cadence betrays algorithmic generation</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements shoehorned rather than synthesized; lab setting and polaroids particularly discordant; no evidence of meaningful compression for short form, reads as fragmented excerpts rather than cohesive narrative</comment>
