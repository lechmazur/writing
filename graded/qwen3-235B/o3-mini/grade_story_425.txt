<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character transformation; motivation is abstract rather than psychological, with minimal behavioral complexity that reduces emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear arc but feels compressed, with strained cause-effect connections (e.g., blackoutâ€™s role as "orchestrated threat" introduced abruptly) undermining cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is stylized and immersive but overly reliant on ornate descriptors; setting remains decorative rather than integral to narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbols like the needle gesture toward thematic cohesion, but emotional beats are often told (e.g., "unwavering conviction") rather than dramatized, limiting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual originality exists (e.g., sewing needle as relic), but lush prose veers into purple territory, with tonal shifts (e.g., "bored excitement") inadequately realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interdependence; creative choices feel deliberate yet underserved by execution, resulting in a fragmented, schematic narrative.</comment>
