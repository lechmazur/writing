<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's brooding nature and desire for freedom are stated but not deeply explored; motivations lack psychological depth or evolution; vintage glasses serve more as ornament than narrative device in revealing inner world.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No clear progression between beats; escape plan feels abrupt; cause-effect relationships between cosmic energies, crater base, and disappearance remain vague; pacing collapses under weight of excessive description.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric potential in cosmic dust and cratered terrain undercut by jarring "car washing" juxtaposition; inconsistent sensory integration leaves setting fragmented rather than immersive; tone of "murky tenderness" inconsistently rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on abstract metaphors ("shifting patterns of light") creates emotional distance rather than engagement; ending lacks resolution or revelation; attempts at poetic symbolism feel hollow without concrete narrative anchoring.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive "dancing dust," "cosmic luminance" and "whispers of conspiracies" read as algorithmically generated; emotional states declared rather than dramatized; clich√©d brooding artist trope gets no subversive treatment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements thrown together haphazardly; "car washing" in particular exists in tonal vacuum; overly ornate prose obscures thematic cohesion; fails to transform constraints into organic storytelling.</comment>
