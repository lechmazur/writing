<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is overly abstract, motivations stated rather than demonstrated, psychological complexity undercut by clich√©d emotional descriptors like "ardent scorn," vendetta lacks concrete stakes or personal details to make it visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through poetic repetition rather than cause-and-effect, lacks tangible narrative arc in word limit, resolution feels abstract rather than earned through specific action or consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic descriptors ("twilight mingled with dust") without unique sensory textures, setting exists as vague backdrop rather than actively shaping character or conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Attempts symbolism (candy vs. rebellion) but relies on overwritten exposition over dramatic showing, theme of kindness/redemption lacks emotional weight due to underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Dominates with purple prose, repetitive phrasing ("clandestine counterattack," "anonymous kindness"), metaphors like "dialogue between sorrow and hope" feel hollow, emotional beats are formulaically telegraphed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Elements crammed together without organic cohesion, style prioritized over substance, brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, thematically ambitious but execution remains superficial.</comment>
