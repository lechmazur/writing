<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Underdeveloped necromancer traits; motivation to map caves lacks psychological depth; necromantic elements exist only superficially without influencing actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as fragmented vignettes without causal progression; repetitive emphasis on atmosphere over narrative momentum; lacks clear structural arc despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystalline cave's sensory details excel, but temporal dissonance between futuristic nostalgia and necromantic elements creates tonal dissonance; old movies feel artificially juxtaposed rather than atmospherically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like 'cacophonous silence' resonate, but emotional engagement is undermined by abstract navel-gazing; ending fails to crystallize themes beyond vague 'mapping as destiny' platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Formulaic juxtaposition of archetypal elements (lonely explorer, cursed cave) with pop-culture nostalgia; metaphors ('sound of resolve') are hollow abstractions; language veers between purple prose and sterile cataloging.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ideas overwhelm cohesion; elements like necromancy and old movies operate in parallel rather than synergy; stylistic flourishes cannot mask undercooked narrative architecture.</comment>
