<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Character motivation remains ephemeral and abstract, with no concrete actions revealing Elliot's psyche beyond overwritten metaphors. No distinct voice or psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>No coherent plot existsâ€”merely atmospheric vignettes without causality, progression, or resolution within the constraints. Actionless recursion substitutes for narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Visually evocative fragments (salt air, machinery hum) clash with inconsistent worldbuilding; candlelit dinners in a tidal power station strain credibility. Sensory details remain decorative rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>1.3</grade><comment>Glossy abstractions (flame-as-metaphor-for-fate) collapse under scrutiny. No emotional stakes, unresolved tension, or thematic throughline. Relies on ornamental language instead of earned impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>0.4</grade><comment>Relentlessly purple prose ("laughing tears blur edges of despair") and repetitive cadences suggest AI-generated flourishes. Character reasoning is conceptualized but not humanized; cliched existential dread replaces originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially without symbiosis; story feels like a collage of prompts rather than a unified vision. Style obfuscates rather than enhances; no lingering resonance beneath surface artifice.</comment>
