<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract concept without internal conflict or tangible decisions shaped by motivation. No distinct voice or psychology to ground mechanical veterinarian’s obsessive goal beyond vague declarations of "sacred taboo."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Amorphous progression lacks cause-effect logic, defined arc, or resolution. Motifs repeat without narrative momentum; scenes float without structural cohesion or consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Visually overloaded setting fragments coherence—kaleidoscopic coral sky and urban decay clash tonally. Sensory details overwhelm without building immersive logic or character-informing meaning.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ornate prose relies on metaphor clusters without emotional grounding. Abstract "transformation" themes float without concrete subtext or payoff. Ending feels like arbitrary punctuation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Predictable juxtapositions (cybernetics + alchemy) lack inventive synthesis. Formulaic adverbial phrases ("relentless pursuit," "profound transformation") and repetitive descriptors ("raucous silence") suggest AI-generated cadence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements crammed together without narrative necessity. Excessive ornamentation substitutes for story—feels like aesthetic collage rather than purposeful construction with emotional or thematic throughline.</comment>
