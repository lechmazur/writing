<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to rewrite villain's tale is clear but lacks concrete actions showing transformation; emotional depth and distinct voice sacrificed for abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot exists as loosely connected vignettes with no tangible progression; surreal encounters fail to create narrative cohesion or satisfying arc within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements like bioluminescence impress visually, but sensory details lack integration with character or plot; setting remains ornamental rather than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theoretical themes of morality and duality present but underdelivered through abstract narration; poetic language prioritized over emotional engagement or narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Reliance on vague metaphors ("reversed echoes") and generalized philosophical statements creates artificial profundity; rhythmic paragraph structures suggest formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements checked off rather than organically integrated; length neither illuminates nor enhances narrative, resulting in superficially complex but ultimately hollow exercise.</comment>
