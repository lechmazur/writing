<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's nobility and motivation to reclaim honor are conceptually clear but lack nuanced interiority or personal stakes; actions align with traits but lack emotional depth beyond abstract symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has arc-like progression but feels rushed; cause-and-effect logic between stub-reassembly and lab fortification is tenuous, with resolution appearing abrupt rather than earned within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid in bursts (e.g., flickering walls, erratic drones) but inconsistent; settings feel disconnected from character’s emotional landscape, with insufficient sensory integration to unify the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Skilled use of metaphor (fire as illusion, ticket stubs as memory) elevates theme; pacing issues undercut emotional impact, but ending achieves symbolic coherence through juxtaposition of technology and decay.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by blending steampunk elements with digital detritus; some phrases ("hollow recklessness") lean on abstraction rather than embodied detail, slightly diluting originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements like cryptic texts and reassembled stubs suggest rich subtext but inconsistently deepen narrative; cohesive in concept but uneven in execution, leaving thematic resonance partially unfulfilled.</comment>
