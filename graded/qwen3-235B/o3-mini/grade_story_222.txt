<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are stated but not dramatized or explored through meaningful action, creating a hollow abstraction rather than compelling human (or non-human) psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Structure exists as poetic vignette rather than plot, lacking clear progression or cause-effect chains; atmospheric momentum replaces narrative development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Alien setting described with sensory flourishes but never becomes fully immersive; atmosphere floats disconnected from character psychology or plot demands.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphors present but become self-indulgent; thematic throughlines dissolve under vague abstraction rather than focused emotional/human resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic vagueness and abstract nouns creates mechanical quality; fresh concepts buried under bloated prose that feels deliberately obscure rather than purposefully stylized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements included with minimal coherence; high-concept components function ornamentally rather than structurally; style dominates over substance.</comment>
