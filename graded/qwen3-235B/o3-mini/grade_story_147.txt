<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character is defined through abstract descriptors rather than concrete actions; motivation exists conceptually but lacks depth in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels perfunctory; progression through the workshop follows expected beats without meaningful tension or surprises.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details like rusted frames and dancing dust, creating an immersive, melancholic mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolic resonance with rust/gold motif, but emotional impact is diluted by overly ornate phrasing; themes of perseverance surface but lack urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on archetypal tropes (labyrinthine workshops, ancient wisdom) with minimal subversion; language borders on purple prose but avoids complete formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved, though tight integration of elements feels calculated; some poetic resonance but lacks transcendent originality.</comment>
