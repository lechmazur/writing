<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character's motivations exist as abstract declarations rather than demonstrated choices; internal conflict remains vague and disconnected from specific actions; the transformation from city planner to prepper lacks psychological plausibility or organic progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative flow is fractured by excessive abstraction; plot points like the handshake deal appear arbitrarily inserted rather than logically emerging; lacks discernible arc within tight word count, feeling more like disconnected poetic fragments than cohesive storyline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Setting details are decorative rather than integral; sensory descriptions are generic and inconsistent (temple architecture vs. "broken constellations"); atmosphere relies too heavily on stock imagery without creating visceral immersion or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies excessively on clich√©d metaphorical language ("chains," "mosaic of lies") that obscures authentic emotional engagement; some memorable phrases undercut by lack of concrete characterization; ending feels artificially triumphant without earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Overloaded with purple prose and contrived symbolism; repetitive adverbial phrases ("meticulously sought guidance," "carefully constructed lies") reveal procedural writing patterns; metaphors lack specificity or meaningful innovation; emotional states are constantly told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially attached rather than organically integrated; the short form becomes an excuse for underdeveloped ideas; lacks clear throughline connecting character, concept, and setting into unified artistic statement; style overwhelms substance.</comment>
