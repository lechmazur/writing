<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character lacks depth despite assigned traits; motivations are stated but not clearly linked to actions; transformation feels abstract rather than earned through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Plot meanders without cause-effect logic; repetitive descriptions replace narrative progression; ending lacks resolution; timeframe gimmicks (oil changes) arbitrarily anchor disjointed scenes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting blends decadence and nature vividly but inconsistently; atmospheric details like "secret hymns" verge on incoherent; object's connection to environment is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on overwritten metaphors (e.g., "coded messages") that lack emotional grounding; theme of transformation remains abstract; ending fails to deliver satisfying thematic payoff despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Heavy-handed "purple prose" dominates; repetitive phrases ("uncharted echoes") suggest formulaic patterning; emotional beats are explicitly stated rather than demonstrated; tone shifts erratically between mystical and mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements feel forcibly imposed (oil changes, bees) rather than organically integrated; atmospheric ambition outpaces narrative cohesion; fails to leverage brevity as a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
