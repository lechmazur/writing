<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract concept rather than fully realized entity; rebelliousness stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; obituary-writing lacks tangible connection to narrative flow; motivations remain poetic ideal rather than psychological reality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Visionary imagery fails to cohere into structured plot; cause-effect relationships dissolve under surreal abstraction; labyrinth motif remains metaphorical dead end; revolution mentioned but not dramatized; pacing mired in description without narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in towering bookshelf architecture; oppressive atmosphere of forbidden knowledge rendered through precise tactile details; spatial descriptions create visceral claustrophobia combined with intellectual grandeur; setting dominates over story but achieves immersive mastery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Heightened poetic voice achieves emotional texture through metaphor ("defiant visions manifesting reality") but suffers from constant telling rather than showing; themes of art's redemptive power emerge through repeated emphasis rather than organic dramatic embodiment; ending lacks resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overburdened with gilded language reaching for profundity; "lucid frenzy" and "whispers of wind" exemplify unoriginal phrasing; emotional resonance constantly undermined by reliance on clich√©d dichotomies (rebellion/conformity); structural predictability disguised as mythic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh actual narrative; element checklist met with superficial integration; style-as-substance approach diminishes thematic weight; miniature epic pretensions overwhelm contained format; conceptually ambitious but executionally ungrounded.</comment>
