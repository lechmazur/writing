<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is symbolic rather than rounded; traits like mechanical intuition drive actions but lack lived-in authenticity. Motivation is clear thematically but feels generalized rather than personal; reactions to objects/concepts are abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot is more atmospheric than action-driven; cause-and-effect relationships are diffuse. The tight word limit emphasizes mood over progression, leaving arc undefined. Timeframe and setting dominate over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hybrid retro-futurism/neon decay is vivid but unevenly grounded. Sensory details (e.g., electric hum, chalk dust) immerse but occasionally overshadow human stakes. "Organized disorder" informs texture but doesn't deepen thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice, hearth, equations) offers thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. Metaphors are often evocative but occasionally vague. Ending is poetic but lacks narrative catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally lapses into lyrical abstraction (e.g., "mechanical dreams") that risks becoming ornate. Sensory details often specific but occasionally generic. Blends genres inventively but sacrifices character nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist thematically but lack narrative symbiosis; story feels constructed around pre-selected motifs rather than organically. Style suits a vignette but lacks urgency. Leaves thematic impressions without emotional resonance.</comment>
