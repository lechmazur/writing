<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic, motivations implied through repetitive actions but lacking emotional depth or nuanced internal conflict; the "factually imaginative" attribute isn't substantively demonstrated through concrete problem-solving or unique insights. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks conventional progression; momentum derives from ritualistic repetition rather than cause-effect dynamics; resolution exists thematically rather than narratively, which weakens cohesion within the constrained word limit. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details - charred spices, embers' glow, handkerchief's tactile presence - but "writing system archive" setting remains conceptually disjointed from culinary activities, weakening immersion. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (grilling as preservation method/act of remembrance) creates powerful subtext; linguistic flourishes sometimes overwhelm emotional authenticity, but recurring imagery establishes thematic resonance. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptions border on purple prose; certain elements feel algorithmically juxtaposed (hopscotch codes, snowflake timeframe); emotional contours remain more implied than embodied through character nuance. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elevated lyrical quality sustains thematic coherence despite structural minimalism; the interplay between erasure and preservation lingers, though narrative urgency remains subdued beneath poetic density. </comment>
