<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded; the assigned traits shape atmosphere more than concrete actions. No distinct narrative voice emerges to anchor motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Lacks clear progression or causal momentum; structure relies on repetitive descriptors instead of meaningful plot beats. The beginning/end connection exists superficially but lacks emotional resonance or transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and eerie atmosphere present, but over-reliance on adjectives/adverbs dilutes immersion. The setting feels like decoration rather than an active force shaping the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Attempts poetic symbolism through pennies/guardian fail to create emotional or intellectual stakes. The ending offers no resolution or revelation, undermining thematic potential. Relies on "telling" through vague abstractions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Predictable gothic tropes (sentient statues, cosmic mysteries) combined with repetitive phrasing ("dour amusement," "oscillate") suggest AI-generated cadence. Overly ornate syntax distracts from substance; emotions are stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Excessive stylistic flourishes compete with narrative cohesion. Assigned elements appear checked off rather than organically integrated; the tight word limit exposes underdeveloped concepts and structural gaps.</comment>
