<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fully lacks depth or believable motivation; character exists as abstract symbol with no relatable inner life or coherent transformation. Assigned traits remain vague abstractions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>No recognizable plot structure or logical progression; disconnected vignettes masquerade as narrative with arbitrary transitions between lab/restaurant/wedding elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Setting described through disconnected buzzwords rather than immersive sensory detail; wedding toasts and neon lights fail to create tangible atmosphere or spatial consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors without emotional grounding; attempts at profound themes (tradition vs. innovation) remain superficially treated; ending lacks earned resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Prose alternates between clich√©d "science vs. folklore" contrasts and pretentious abstraction; repetitive descriptors ("primal sophistication") substitute for authentic originality; plastic hair clip feels arbitrarily chosen.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Elements mechanically crammed together without organic narrative synthesis; forced juxtapositions of lab/wedding/restaurant fail to create meaningful tension or thematic cohesion.</comment>
