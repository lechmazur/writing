<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth and concrete development; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated. Assigned traits remain abstract, and the character's interactions with key elements lack narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure or arc. Events aren't progression-driven, and the word limit exacerbates fragmentation rather than containing coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory details about decaying grandeur and celestial elements, but atmospheric motifs don't coalesce into cohesive thematic support for character or narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on abstract metaphors obscures emotional resonance. Language is vivid but self-indulgent; lacks narrative momentum and unresolved tension or clear thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Excessive ornamentation borders on purple prose. Predictable imagery ("echoes of eternity") and tonal shifts suggest formulaic writing rather than organic storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but haphazardly assembled. Lacks stylistic confidence or conceptual innovation to justify its ambitious scope within brevity constraints.</comment>
