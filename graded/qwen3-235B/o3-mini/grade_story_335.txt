<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (peace with the past) is clear but remains abstract; "carefully reckless" trait is stated rather than demonstrated through specific decisions; emotional landscape feels generalized rather than psychologically precise</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks active progression - more a static mood piece; no clear cause-and-effect chain despite fragmented structure; resolution feels aspirational rather than earned through narrative mechanics</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting provides strong visual palette but struggles with physical logic (how cathedral became street art haven); sensory details often abstract rather than visceral; time element ("echoing hour") underutilized</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Idealized language ("defiant resilience," "vibrant murals") overwhelms concrete storytelling; metaphors stated overtly rather than emerging organically; emotional beats telegraphed rather than dramatized</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©s ("haunted by regrets") and ornate abstraction; uneven sentence rhythm oscillates between pretentious flourishes and simplistic declarations; metaphors (struggling spider = inner torment) lack originality</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but superficially connected; style dominates substance; length feels restrictive rather than intentional; theme of redemption surfaces but lacks narrative mechanics to dramatize transformation</comment>
