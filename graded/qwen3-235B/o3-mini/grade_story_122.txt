<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character lacks tangible development; motivations are abstract and inconsistently demonstrated through action. Assigned traits exist as ornamental descriptors rather than defining aspects of behavior or decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under word limit constraints; disjointed sequences suggest arbitrary transitions rather than causal progression. Ill-defined arc fails to create satisfying narrative momentum in the given scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting relies on overused fantasy tropes ("necropolis among clouds") and vague sensory details; atmosphere exists mainly as poetic abstraction rather than immersive environment shaping character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery diluted by vague, repetitive metaphors. Thematic intentions are stated rather than explored through subtext; emotional resonance remains superficial and authorially imposed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Riddled with flowery, mechanical language ("cosmic resolve," "tumultuous lightning") and clich√©d oppositions. Relies on AI-generated patterns of contrasting abstract forces without original conceptual grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements force-fitted rather than organically combined; brevity exposes structural shallowness rather than intentional concision. Stylistic excess obscures narrative substance or lingering impact.</comment>
