<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character has clear internal motivation tied to their background, but lacks nuanced reactions or complexity; motivations remain consistent but only superficially explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pacing feels uneven within the tight word limit; the storm as a catalyst lacks organic integration, and the narrative arc remains underdeveloped despite attempts at symbolic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric with sensory details, but the bunker’s bureaucratic decay leans on tropes; the tone of "hushed turbulence" is evocatively rendered but inconsistently sustained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and symbolic imagery elevate the story, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstraction; the theme of regeneration is cohesive but overly idealized, weakening its impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing and recurring motifs ("hushed turbulence") border on cliché; some subtextual depth exists, but predictable archetypes and a lack of narrative surprise undermine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements are used narratively, but reliance on poetic vagueness obscures cohesion; the story’s brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, leaving thematic ideas underexplored.</comment>
