<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character traits remain abstract concepts; motivations for actions like butterfly tracking are stated but not dramatized or logically connected to "wayward" nature; no distinguishable voice despite first-person implications.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Lacks plot progression entirely; action verbs like "track" and "infect" exist only as poetic metaphors with no causal relationships; no discernible arc within constraints; temporal markers like "between broken treaties" serve as decorative repetitions rather than structural elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Superficial steampunk descriptors (gears, steam) repeated without functional integration; "battered marvel" tone manifests as buzzwords rather than lived-in atmosphere; sensory details are generic and disassociated from emotional or narrative context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Over-reliance on contradictory adjectives undermines coherence; attempts at thematic unity through repetition ("broken treaties") feel mechanical rather than resonant; no substantial subtext beneath surface-level poeticism; the concept of "unconventional love" remains entirely abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Riddled with overwritten passages and inconsistent metaphors; "infect" shifts meaning without narrative justification; excessive abstraction and ornate phrasing obscure rather than enhance meaning; patterns suggest algorithmic layering of "literary" devices without critical engagement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements included as checklist items rather than organic components; forced juxtaposition of apothecary role with Morse code/steam mechanics; writing style actively impedes clarity; no evidence of intentional brevity, with content feeling truncated rather than condensed; fails to provoke meaningful reflection.</comment>
