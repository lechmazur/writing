<question>1</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Character lacks discernible traits beyond vague poetic descriptors; motivation to "map sacred spaces" is asserted without psychological depth or concrete goal-oriented actions; no distinct voice emerges in abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>0.5</grade><comment>No plot structure identified - static sequences of imagery replace cause/effect; lack of conflict/resolution renders "file during filing" action meaningless; episodic descriptions without narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through hypnotic sensory contradictions (luminescent fruits vs. endless night) but fails to ground reader in coherent spatial logic; setting elements described ornamental rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Overly cryptic language obfuscates meaning; inconsistent metaphoric register (DJ/pencil case vs. cosmic divine) creates dissonance; rhetorical flourishes dominate over emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending techno-mystic and botanical themes is undermined by conventional poetic crutches ("vibrant hum", "divine murmurs"); surreal conceits lack follow-through as cohesive imaginative system.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>Element inclusion feels checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; ornate style consistently prioritizes over clarity, creating impression of linguistic surface over narrative substance.</comment>
