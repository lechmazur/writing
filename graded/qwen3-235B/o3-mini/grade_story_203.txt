<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and underdeveloped; stage fright is mentioned but never demonstrated through concrete action or internal conflict, weakening believability of inherited guilt or cosmic pilgrimage. Motivation exists as poetic abstraction rather than psychological imperative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Pseudo-plot relies on vague, repetitive metaphors ("key turning in lock") instead of coherent cause-effect progression. Ambiguous "journey" lacks tangible stakes or escalating challenges. Pacing uneven, with abstract imagery substituting for narrative development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting functions primarily as surreal backdrop; orbital debris and toy assembly evoke disjointed images but fail to deepen thematic resonance. Sensory details remain overly poetic, sacrificing visceral immersion for vague atmospheric flourishes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d literary devices (metaphors as blunt symbols) undercuts emotional impact. Thematic connections between "exorcism," inheritance, and cosmic void remain implied rather than demonstrated. Ending feels arbitrary, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Language veers between unnecessarily ornate ("defiant hush") and generic phrasing typical of algorithmic writing. Tropes (haunted heirs, cosmic epiphanies) appear without subversion. Subtext remains superficially stated rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements appear forced together without organic synergy; plot exists primarily as excuse to string symbolic motifs. Writing style detracts from clarity rather than enhancing it. Limited emotional or intellectual resonance inherent in brevity remains underutilized.</comment>
