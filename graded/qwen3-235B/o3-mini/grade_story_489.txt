<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and undefined—motivation implied but never fully dramatized. Assigned attribute 'aggressively kind' lacks concrete manifestation. No distinct voice despite second-person proximity. Actions feel dictated by plot mechanics rather than internal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Plot exists as poetic impression, not causal progression. The whale's call and dancer's footfall lack narrative buildup or follow-through. Beginning/middle/end structure absent—ends before any real engagement. Pacing uneven, with dense description crowding pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently applied. Sensory details (shattered glass, midnight cold) anchor readers, while elements like the dancer and whale call remain unconnected to the lighthouse's physical decay. Spatial logic muddled in secret passages sequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uses metaphor ('whale summons', 'serene song of ocean') effectively but superficially. Theme of tradition revival hinted but underexplored. Ending achieves symbolic closure but lacks emotional weight. Overreliance on abstract phrases ('weight and lightness of legacy') dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stilted diction ('remarkably balanced resolve', 'ephemeral stage') evokes formulaic cadences. Sudden shifts (whale call instructing observer, dancer appearing) lack narrative logic. Metaphors feel overwrought rather than revelatory. Language aspires to profundity but often obscures meaning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Element checklist fulfillment outweighs cohesion. Assigned elements co-exist rather than interact—allusions to dancer, whale, whistle, and kindness are superficial additions, not organic components. Style prioritizes ornament over clarity, creating distancing effect rather than immersion.</comment>
