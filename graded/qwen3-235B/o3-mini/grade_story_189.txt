<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains flat despite clear motivation; actions consistent but lack psychological depth or transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot moves through set pieces without clear causality; lacks momentum within constrained word count despite thematic symmetry in beginning/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Echoes of war and ruins evoke atmosphere, but sensory details are overwritten yet superficial; tone inconsistent between hauntology and techno-spiritual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overused metaphors ("cosmic lifeblood") and simplistic theme of "rebirth" limit impact; flickering lights and ancient vs. modern juxtaposition show some craft but lack fresh subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Formulaic "chosen one" arc fused with post-apocalyptic tropes; repetitive descriptors ("bright-eyed," "brazen calm") feel imposed rather than organic; "overcharge" as forced high-tech mysticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function superficially but lack integration; length feels restrictive rather than stylized; closure appears contrived through thematic repetition rather than earned resolution.</comment>
