<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Amelia lacks emotional depth or believable internal conflict; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through action or interaction. The "bitterly optimistic" attribute remains superficial, never manifesting in tangible decisions or character-defining moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of atmospheric moments rather than a coherent arc; the detour decision has no tangible consequences, and the central "unify" action remains abstract. Cause-effect relationships are obscured by excessive stylization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with effective sensory details (iridescent skies, sterile research station) that create immersion. Atmosphere occasionally overwhelms substance, but the xenobiology station's alien-adjacent scientific decay provides compelling texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts grand thematic synthesis but settles for surface-level juxtaposition of myth/science rather than meaningful integration. Memorable phrases ("knife-edge between caution and chaotic ambition") compensate for underdeveloped emotional core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Riddled with empty poetic abstraction ("heavens wept gentle showers") and AI-writing hallmarks: repetitive sentence structures, overly precise yet meaningless descriptors, and synthetic metaphors lacking visceral specificity. No discernible authorial voice beneath the linguistic veneer.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as decorative checklist items rather than narrative engines. The story feels constructed post-hoc around required components rather than organically emerging from them, resulting in conceptual dissonance between motifs.</comment>
