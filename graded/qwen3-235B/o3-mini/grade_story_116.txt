<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (excavating memories via photographs, drawing a map of endless night) are conceptually present but lack concrete psychological anchoring. "Dismayed" is stated, not demonstrated through action or internal conflict. No distinct voice in this abstracted, passive narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Murky cause-effect relationship. Action (excavating via photographs) doesn't produce clear narrative progression. Repetitive descriptions substituting for arc. No tangible beginning/middle/end in tight word limit, just circular self-referential imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere with "black velvet sky-lounge" and "moonlit arcs." Sensory details like "celestial hum" and "shimmering garden paths" create immersive, melancholic wonder. However, setting remains decorative rather than driving plot or character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Beautifully crafted metaphors ("tapestry of garden secrets," "vibrant geography of unceasing night") but lack narrative through-line. Theme of mapping time/memory is conceptualized but emotionally distant. Overly reliant on telling (e.g., "laconic exuberance") rather than immersive demonstration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Formulaic pattern emerges: noun phrase + contradictory adjective + poetic abstraction ("stark elegance," "serene glow"). Clich√©d tropes ("weight of unspoken promises") repeated with elaborate syntax substituting for originality. Emotionless character mechanics suggest algorithmic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cobwebbed assembly of assigned elements creates museum-piece surrealism without underlying logic. Style overwhelms substance; the "endless night" concept remains a shallow metaphor. No lingering effect beyond initial aesthetic impression.</comment>
