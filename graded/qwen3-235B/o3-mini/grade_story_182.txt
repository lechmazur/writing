<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations (chaos co-authorship, churning memories) are poetic but lack psychological specificity or clear behavioral drivers. Emotional depth relies more on metaphorical abstraction than lived-in authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette rather than structured narrative. Flickering projector and mural peeling create cyclical ambiance but lack concrete progression or stakes. Beginning/end repetition creates symmetry without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting exquisitely evoked through sensory details (peeling paint, projector glow, mountain chill) but atmospheric richness doesn't translate into functional storytelling. Mysterious elements (magnetic mountain) create mood without narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Poetic language creates lingering melancholy. Falters in subtext/nuanceâ€”relies on stating emotions ("yearning," "sorrow") rather than earned resonance. Memorable imagery but underdeveloped through-lines between symbolism and action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Prose oscillates between overwritten ("frolicsome regret," "spectral memories") and generic. Relies on familiar tropes (haunted heirlooms, mystical mountains) without subversion. Sensory details impress but often feel decorative rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently integrated. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful. Atmospheric cohesion exists, but thematic urgency and emotional stakes remain diffuse. Ambition outpaces execution.</comment>
