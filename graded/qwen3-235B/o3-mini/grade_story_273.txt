<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is archetypal rather than psychologically complex; motivation exists as stated concept but lacks internal conflict or nuanced personal stakes. Actions serve thematic abstraction over human behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>No discernible narrative structureâ€”conflict, progression, or resolution. Repetitive descriptors substitute for plot momentum within constraining word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting vividly rendered through mythic imagery and sensory details, but atmospheric richness outweighs functional integration with narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and poetic language, though intellectual themes overshadow emotional engagement. Ending lacks tension despite thematic clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Evocative concepts undermined by formulaic descriptors ("murky silence," "timeless twilight"), inconsistent metaphor application, and emotionally distant narration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements present but often ornamental. Ambitious theme and atmosphere coexist with structural deficiencies and under-exploration of subversive implications.</comment>
