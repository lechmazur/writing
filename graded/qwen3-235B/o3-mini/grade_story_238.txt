<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is a collection of abstract traits without believable depth, conflicting motivations, or meaningful development. Actions and assigned attributes don't cohere into a psychologically compelling figure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot exists as a series of vague symbolic gestures rather than a narrative. Confessions, drone, and wallet lack tangible progression. Resolution feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory atmosphere built from carnival decay and spectral light, but sensory details often feel more decorative than essential to narrative momentum or character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (light/dark, transient realities) and lyrical prose, but emotional impact remains surface-level. Deeper philosophical themes ("quiet redemption") are stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates ("whispered echoes of lost moments"). Overuse of abstract descriptors ("enigmatic familiarity"), predictable tropes ("worn wallet heavy with memories"), and self-conscious poeticism undermine authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely connected. Style overshadows substance. Attempts at profundity often feel performative rather than organically earned through character or narrative development.</comment>
