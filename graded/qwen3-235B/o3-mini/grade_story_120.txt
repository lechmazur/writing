<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Formless as narrative; time-loop repetition presented as thematic concern rather than structural device; absence of rising action, climax, or resolution renders plot non-existent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rich in impressionistic imagery but chronically underdeveloped; quantum tunnel functions as vague metaphor rather than functional setting; sensory details aesthetically pleasing but atmospherically unmoored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fluency in literary techniques undermined by excessive telling over showing; theme of trauma/transformation present but under-explored; languid lyricism fails to compensate for emotional distance and conceptual murkiness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements assembled with decorative placement rather than narrative necessity; stylistic flourishes replace substance; brevity highlights rather than conceals structural deficiencies; nothing meaningfully stakes or questions.</comment>
