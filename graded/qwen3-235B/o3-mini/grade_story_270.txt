<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (yearning for connection vs. cynicism) are abstractly stated but not demonstrated through concrete actions. Assigned traits feel surface-level, failing to shape the conjurer's specific choices or arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Narrative lacks propulsion—a static ritual scene with no stakes or payoff. The "awaken" action is ritualistic but lacks cause-effect logic or meaningful progression within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eerie, evocative descriptions create immersive atmosphere. The lighthouse library's decay and spectral light effectively reinforce the tone, though some sensory details border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic prose offers emotional resonance through metaphor (myth/truth blurring) and subtext about preserving memory. Impact is undercut by lack of narrative tension or transformative character moment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on AI-style formulaic phrasing ("whispers of time," "ash of unspoken memories"). Predictable ritual structure with ornate but hollow metaphors that evoke style over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce thematically but lack dynamism. The lush prose masks a hollow core—prioritizing mood over narrative purpose in a way that feels self-indulgent rather than deliberate.</comment>
