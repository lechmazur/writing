<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond archetypal labels; inconsistent motivations (pseudo-mystical fraud vs. authentic seeker) never fully reconciled; assigned traits like "peaceful anger" remain abstract, unconnected to tangible actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into vignettes; no clear progression from "explore" to resolution; excessive focus on atmospheric description suffocates narrative momentum; arbitrary transitions between scenes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Poorly defined timeframe ("throughout planting") muddies context; setting described through generic decay metaphors; atmosphere overwhelmed by overwritten abstractions rather than specific sensory engagement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d "soul's awakening" themes; overwritten prose overwhelms emotional authenticity; heavy-handed symbolism (bones=old knowledge) lacks nuance; ending feels like recycled philosophical platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Overabundance of contradictory vague descriptors ("calm fury," "peaceful anger"); repetitive adjectival overkill; plot mechanics follow predictable "mystical artifact awakens destiny" template; lacks original narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements forced into symbolic roles without organic integration; excessive ornateness obscures narrative clarity; brevity doesn't serve a purpose but emphasizes underdeveloped concepts; leaves no lasting impression beyond decorative phrases.</comment>
