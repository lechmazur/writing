<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than developed; motivation (childhood promise) stated but not dramatized through concrete actions or conflicts; "timid" trait inconsistently manifests compared to boldness of her revolutionary stitching; lacks distinct voice despite first-person narrative potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Plot resembles thematic poem more than structured narrative; repetitive circular imagery replaces forward momentum; beginning and end mirror each other without clear progression or resolution of tensions; arcade scoreboard and temple setting create disjointed cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually lush atmosphere with tactile descriptions of textiles and ruins; storm/light contrasts create dynamic tonal shifts; however, artificial integration of industrial arcade elements weakens cohesive mythic ambiance; sensory details excel in textile work but falter with anachronistic objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic framework (stitching as collective healing) creates intellectual resonance; poetic devices (marble cracks echoing ballads) elevate thematic depth; pacing issues and lack of narrative urgency prevent full emotional engagement despite rich metaphorical layering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Excessive ornamental prose ("revolution of gentle defiance") veers into purple writing; striking originality in mythic-technological juxtapositions compromised by inconsistent execution; emotional impact weakened by telling rather than showing resilience through character behavior; fresh weaving motif diluted by over-elaboration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elegant language fails to unify disparate elements (temple ruins with arcade scoreboard); thematic coherence sacrificed to aesthetic priorities; brevity highlights structural weaknesses rather than creating deliberate compression; lingering effect comes from poetic flair over narrative substance.</comment>
