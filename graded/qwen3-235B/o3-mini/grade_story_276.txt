<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth or evolution; exists primarily as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a psychologically plausible entity. Motivation remains philosophical abstraction rather than concrete driver of action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Amorphous structure substitutes metaphorical progression for narrative causality; lacks definable conflict/resolution arc despite strong imagery. Pacing creates impression of suspended animation rather than purposeful progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Visual atmosphere of orbital decay is vivid but underutilizedâ€”space trash setting fails to meaningfully interact with thematic elements. Sensory details remain aesthetically pleasing but dramatically inert.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Poetic language contains occasional resonant images ("metallic stars," "tapestry of cosmic meaning") but overreliance on conceptual juxtaposition dilutes emotional impact. Thematic ambition exceeds execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on decorative abstraction ("cosmic detritus," "accidental wisdom") suggests algorithmic generation patterns. Metaphors are numerous but rarely surprising or specific to this narrative context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>While all elements are technically present, their arrangement feels mechanical rather than organic. Attempts at thematic "depth" emerge from accumulated poetic fragments rather than narrative integration or conceptual innovation.</comment>
