<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits stated rather than demonstrated; motivations remain abstract with minimal concrete actions revealing personality. Underestimated rebel status lacks tangible manifestation in plot-relevant decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Meandering progression through haunted house lacks causal chain; disconnected vignettes replace coherent structure. Timeframe compression creates artificial tension rather than earned narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Haunted house tropes recycled without fresh sensory specifics; taco memories inconsistently integrate with setting decay. Atmospheric potential undercut by generic descriptions of "creaking" and "flickering".</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors ("canvas for survival") outnumber authentic emotional beats. Central conflict remains amorphous; "art of adaptation" theme stated rather than embodied through character transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Formulaic juxtaposition of gloom and hope; reliance on clich√©d taco bonding and haunted amusement attractions. Purple prose permeates ("whispering forgotten secrets"), while character psychology remains mechanistically logical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Forced coexistence of elements without narrative synergy; "art of adaptation" remains conceptual rather than plot-driven. Overwritten style obscures emotional authenticity despite ambitious thematic intentions.</comment>
