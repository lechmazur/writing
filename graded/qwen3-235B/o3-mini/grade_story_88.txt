<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete personality, actions, or growth. Motivation as a concept exists but lacks human nuance or tangible expression through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as fragmented vignettes rather than a unified narrative. Cause-effect relationships are abstract rather than logical. Pacing drifts without urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Evocative visual terms ("gilded halls," "mosaics") contrast with sparse tactile/auditory details. Atmosphere is aesthetically rich but inconsistently immersive due to underdeveloped sensory texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and conceptual ambition, but lacks emotional urgency or thematic complexity. Metaphors are decorative rather than revelatory; conflict remains amorphous.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts originality through paradoxical juxtapositions (toaster + Sumerian palace), but relies on predictable AI-archivist tropes. Language veers toward ornate abstraction without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements feel collaged rather than synthesized. The tight word limit exacerbates disjointedness between conceptual components. Style prioritizes poetic density over narrative clarity.</comment>
