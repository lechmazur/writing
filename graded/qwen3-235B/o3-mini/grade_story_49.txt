<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Attribute "lukewarm" contradicts the mage's resolute determination; motivation to "paint a future free from fear" is stated but underexplored; reactions to the doormat are emotionally vague.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks functional plot structure; "clash" is referenced but never enacted; no cause-effect progression; beginning/end disconnected; pacing glacial and unfocused.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lunar-desolate and sensorially vivid (craters echoing, cold walls); tone contrasts with cosmic harshness; setting-object integration (doormat as relic) strong, but stage fog impractical in vacuum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uses striking metaphors ("charred serenity") but excessive abstraction dilutes impact; subtext about memory/identity exists but remains amorphous; ending feels decorative, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on AI-typical repetitive phrasing ("echoes," "swirling stage fog"); clich√©d contrasts (despair/hope); overly ornate descriptors ("torn doormat corner") lack narrative purpose; tone feels performative, not organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</question><comment>Elements added as checklist items; lunar base's sci-fi setting clashes with stage fog/artifacts; length feels restrictive; themes of hope/recollection remain superficially gestural.</comment>
