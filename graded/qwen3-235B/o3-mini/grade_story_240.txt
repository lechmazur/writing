<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Poor character development; motivations are abstract and repetitive, lacking psychological depth or emotional nuance. Actions don't reveal distinct personality. No growth or internal conflict. Emotions are stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Absence of coherent plot structure. Static vignettes with no progression, resolution, or narrative arc. Cause-and-effect relationships missing. Pacing stagnant. Timeframe and memory framing create disorientation, not cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Sparse but inconsistent sensory details. Setting described via clichés ("gnarled forest") with superficial atmosphere. Imagery repeats without purpose. Timeframe and village lack integration with character actions or plot logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors and tired symbolism (e.g., "twilight cradled secrets"). Weak emotional impact; ending loops without revelation or thematic payoff. No subtext or conflict. Relies on vague, abstract language rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing ("whispered ancient prophecies," "dreadful hope") and clichéd fantasy tropes. Excessive, inconsistent descriptors ("lavishly humble"). No subversion of genre expectations. Overly ornate prose ("manufactured miracles") feels artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements feel forced into a shallow framework. No organic cohesion. Style prioritizes decoration over clarity. Length exacerbates lack of narrative substance. Leaves no lingering impact beyond vague mysticism.</comment>
