<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, defined by ornamental descriptions rather than coherent psychology; zealotry and motivation lack narrative integration or emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Lacks discernible plot progression, relying on static vignettes; abrupt shifts and absence of cause-effect logic undermine coherence despite poetic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Eerie setting evoked through diffuse sensory imagery, but fails to establish concrete spatial or temporal orientation; decorative rather than functional worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors and abstract thematic gestures ("sacrifice," "legacy") without narrative embodiment; prose style prioritizes density over emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Excessive "purple prose" and clich√©-ridden phrasing (e.g., "wisps of forgotten hopes") suggest algorithmic affectation; lacks distinctive authorial voice or conceptual innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements present but inert; story functions as fragmented mood piece rather than cohesive narrative; fails to leverage constraints creatively.</comment>
