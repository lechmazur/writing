<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is visually distinct with melancholy/defiance, but motivations remain abstract concepts rather than visceral experiences. Rituals hint at depth, but lack specific humanizing contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure traces a circular day/night cycle, but lacks transformative arc. Cloud-tracking method feels repetitive rather than progressive. Coherence maintained through atmospheric consistency over plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blends surreal juxtapositions (horse stables/tech) and mundane details effectively, but sensory immersion falters. Neon/futuristic elements only superficially interact with character's inner struggles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric heft in "cosmos vs. machinery" theme; rubber stamp as heirloom symbol works subtextually. Lyrical prose occasionally veers into abstract murkiness rather than emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resists genre tropes with unconventional object/storybeat pairings (stamp as mystical relic). Avoids cloying tech-sentimentality fusion. Sensory details occasionally generic but overall voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion emerges through recurring motifs rather than plot. Elements function interdependently but don't achieve transcendent synthesis. Thematic durability questionable beyond immediate aesthetic impact.</comment>
