<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "analytically creative" and "earnest mockery" are stated but insufficiently demonstrated through action or nuanced motivation; reactions to the lamp and mission lack depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression or cause-effect; events form an impressionistic sketch rather than a structured arc; cohesion exists but resolution feels abstract rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Attempts at surreal atmosphere using data streams and naptime setting, but sparse sensory details and underdeveloped "pattern recognition center" hinder immersion; tone remains abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses evocative metaphors (lamp as evolving hopes) and explores unity-through-redemption themes, but relies heavily on abstract telling rather than concrete showing; lyrical style elevates but emotional impact remains superficial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Poetic language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; subverts no major tropes but presents a unique "tech-mysticism" synthesis; emotional resonance is conceptually implied rather than experientially constructed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>High conceptual ambition meets uneven execution; elements function symbolically but often lack narrative integration; style dominates over structural and character rigor required for elite publishability.</comment>
