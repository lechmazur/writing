<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness is stated but not demonstrated; motivations tied to photographs and flowers remain abstract, lacking organic connection to actions; inconsistent emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No discernible plot progression or resolution; reliance on static imagery and abstract musings creates meandering structure; cause-effect relationships are nebulous within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently textured; toxic greenhouse setting and rain are evocative yet undermined by repetitive descriptions and sparse integration with character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overuse of clich√©d metaphors and opaque similes detracts from visceral impact; attempts at subtext in blurring boundaries are superficial; ending feels arbitrarily poetic rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Pervasive "purple prose" and formulaic descriptors (e.g., "surreal ambiance") suggest automated excess; emotional states are redundantly stated rather than shown; lacks distinctive stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements feel artificially grafted; while the toxic rain and flowers hint at thematic cohesion, the narrative fails to coalesce into a unified whole with lasting resonance.</comment>
