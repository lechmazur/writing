<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; traits like "ruthless" and "intellectually spontaneous" aren't demonstrated through concrete actions, reducing motivation to opaque poeticism rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as literary talismans rather than narrative drivers; stylistic flourishes compensate for thin plot coherence.</comment>
