<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but lacks tangible motivation or internal conflict; actions feel symbolic rather than driven by coherent psychology. No distinct voice or evolving emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>No clear arc or resolution; plot is static, prioritizing mood over progression. Action logic is abstract, pacing uneven within word constraints. Disconnected beginning/middle/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative sensory language creates a vivid cyber-mythic world, but atmospheric elements often overwhelm narrative purpose. "Comforting unease" tone is inconsistently maintained through abstract juxtapositions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric depth and thematic resonance between myth/technology, but lacks emotional urgency. Ending feels rhetorical rather than earned. Impressive craft but limited narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but lapses into ornate "idea-density" without emotional grounding. Some phrases verge on purple prose. Conceptual originality exists, but execution feels algorithmically associative rather than humanly intuitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency. Style leans on imagery over substance. Length exposes underdeveloped plot potential but serves contemplative tone. Lingering aesthetic impression, not thematic clarity.</comment>
