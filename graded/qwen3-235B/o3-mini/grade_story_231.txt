<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite assigned traits; traits are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions. Emotional depth of "sentimental" or "spontaneous" lacks tangible expression. Dialogue/voice remains generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear causal links; discovery of coordinates initiates action but resolution feels arbitrary and disconnected. Pacing is uneven with abrupt shifts between scenes. Thematic conclusion isn't earned through narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting evokes vague ancient atmosphere through abstract descriptors but lacks vivid sensory details. Timeframe (anchor lifting) and location (Sumerian palace) aren't meaningfully integrated into character motivation or plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ornate prose contains poetic imagery but relies on clich√©d metaphor clusters. Themes of justice/chaos remain abstract; emotional impact diluted by excessive telling rather than showing. Ending feels like didactic proclamation rather than narrative resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Mechanical repetition of elevated diction creates artificial tone. Overused phrases ("bittersweet wisdom," "eternal struggle") suggest formulaic writing. Concept integration feels forced rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially without creating cohesive narrative or thematic synthesis. Length emphasizes constraints rather than creative potential. Symbolism operates at surface level without generating meaningful resonance.</comment>
