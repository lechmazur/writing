<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Character is purely aesthetic abstraction; no coherent motivations or psychology beyond arbitrary poetic descriptors. Zero emotional stakes or concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.3</grade><comment>No plot structure or cause-effect exists - just disconnected metaphors masquerading as narrative. No beginning/middle/end within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pervasive sensory details create immersive atmosphere despite minimalism; the dandelion field's visual/scent elements work synergistically with melancholy tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</comment><grade>Overloaded with empty metaphors that don't coalesce into meaningful themes; attempts emotional resonance through adjectives rather than substance.</grade>
<question>5</question><grade>0.5</comment><grade>Excessive purple prose, repetitive abstractions ("fragile blooms", "arcane dance"), and formulaic emotional "beats" indicate algorithmic pattern generation rather than original vision.</grade>
<question>6</question><grade>1.9</comment><grade>Completely disjointed despite elaborate descriptions; elements function as decorative checklist items rather than organic components of storytelling.</grade>
