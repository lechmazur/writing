<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kenji is a symbol-laden figure rather than a fully realized person. His motivation to escape violence is stated but not dramatized through specific actions or decisions. Minimal agency shown beyond passive reflection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Progresses from entry to twilight exit but lacks structural clarity. Meandering sensory descriptions overshadow narrative momentum, with no tangible cause-effect chain. The "journey" concept feels abstract rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocatively fused: moss-stone corridors, waning twilight, delicate skies during seed planting create a visceral atmosphere of decayed glory. Sensory details (shimmering spectacles catching light) heighten the theme without crowding it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhetorical flourishes ("centuries-old walls echoing with regrets") risk mawkishness, but fragmented structure mirrors "broken pieces" theme. Ending offers closure through serenity rather than plot resolution, which may divide readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some AI-like formalism ("corroded rapture," "transformative grace") clashes with organic tone. Tropes (haunted hero, relic-driven redemption) are conventional but mildly subverted through lyrical abstraction. Emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion emerges from thematic unity rather than narrative force. Assignments feel purposefully knitted (spectacles/symbolism) but occasionally arbitrary (seed planting as timeframe). Language elevates concept beyond formula, if unevenly.</comment>
