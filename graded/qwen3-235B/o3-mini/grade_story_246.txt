<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but not demonstrated through actions. Motivation for breaking curses remains vague and poorly connected to concrete behaviors. Reactions to objects like the handkerchief reveal little about Edgar’s internal world.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Narrative lacks causal coherence, with disconnected scenes mimicking progression. Pacing is either rushed or stagnant, and the word limit exacerbates structural fragmentation rather than mitigating it. The beginning and end fail to resonate as a unified arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements (e.g., magnetic anomaly) are referenced but underdeveloped. Sensory details are sporadic and superficial, failing to immerse readers in the world or tie the setting to character motivations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>Overwrought language drowns out emotional impact. Metaphors and symbols are opaque rather than evocative. The ending lacks resonance or thematic closure, feeling like a checklist of "profound" clichés rather than meaningful storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Relies on overused tropes (e.g., cursed artifacts, haunted letters) without innovation. Repetitive phrasing, unnatural tonal shifts, and "purple prose" suggest formulaic construction. Emotional beats are stated rather than conveyed through nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Elements feel arbitrarily appended rather than integrated. The story’s form appears constrained by external requirements rather than driven by narrative purpose. No lingering thematic or emotional resonance emerges.</comment>
