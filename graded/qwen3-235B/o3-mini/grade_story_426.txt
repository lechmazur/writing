<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are vaguely stated rather than shown through coherent action; the protagonist's connection to folk medicines lacks tangible demonstration, and the "angrily peaceful" trait remains abstract without behavioral grounding. The teapot's symbolic role is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loose episodic structure mimics a dream but sacrifices narrative momentum. Key actions (playlist hacking, ghost hugging) feel disconnected from plot resolution. Marathon timeline provides loose scaffolding but fails to anchor cause-and-effect progression. Ending lacks earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on gothic clichés (mists, ghosts) without distinctive sensory innovation. The derelict park's setting remains superficially realized—abandoned rides and spectral trains evoke genre defaults rather than a lived-in world. Tonal dissonance between mystical and technological elements persists.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Excessive metaphoric abstraction ("echoing hacked playlists") substitutes for emotional engagement. Attempts at poetic juxtaposition (folk-tech, solitude-sorrow) lack visceral impact. The theme of preserving traditions feels intellectually presented rather than dramatized through concrete stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on brooding loner tropes and mystical quest archetypes without subversion. The prose alternates between purple patches ("wounded heart resonating with eerie solitude") and generic descriptors. Playlist-hacking as a narrative device feels contrived, suggesting algorithmic generation of "edgy" combinations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in uneasy juxtaposition rather than organic interconnection. The core conflict between tradition/innovation remains abstract. Despite atmospheric turns, the story fails to coalesce into a unified artistic statement or provoke lasting resonance beyond initial surreal impression.</comment>
