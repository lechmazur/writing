<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters function as poetic abstractions rather than three-dimensional beings; motivations exist but lack psychological realism, internal conflict, or believable behavioral patterns. Assigned traits remain superficially described rather than dramatized through meaningful action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a vague arc of discovery but lacks concrete stakes, clear turning points, or narrative tension; the blueprint fragment's significance remains abstract, while the ending feels predetermined rather than earned through organic development of cause-and-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously rendered through over-stylized descriptors, but the setting's mechanical elements remain decorative rather than integrally connected to character motivations or thematic concerns; sensory details occasionally border on sensory overload without deeper purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose demonstrates command of literary language but struggles with showing over telling; metaphors often overshadow narrative momentum, and thematic coherence remains aspirational rather than fully realized through dramatized character development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s through unusual combinations of elements but occasionally succumbs to self-admiring prose and poetic vagueness; emotional resonance exists in concept more than execution, with character reasoning feeling more symbolic than psychologically authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly self-conscious stylistic flourishes occasionally overwhelm narrative cohesion; elements feel stacked rather than integrated organically; thematic potential exists but realization falters under the weight of ambitious conceptual layering without sufficient grounding.</comment>
