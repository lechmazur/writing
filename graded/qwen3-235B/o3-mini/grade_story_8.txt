<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (retooling handed-down stories) is clear but lacks psychological nuance or emotional trajectory; "dazed noble" remains a symbolic abstraction without tangible inner conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structure relies on cyclical dawn-to-dusk vignettes rather than a cohesive arc; plot progression is implied rather than dramatized, lacking concrete stakes or resolution within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere crafted through poetic sensory details (e.g., "pale light of dawn," "vibrato of sound garden") effectively evokes mysticism, but setting-device integration (chalk, sound garden) remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the thematic fusion of tradition/rebellion; however, emotional resonance is diluted by excessive abstraction rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some phrases border on pretentious ("cosmic dance of hidden dreams"), yet the conceit of chalk-as-revolutionary-tool demonstrates ingenuity; avoids AI clich√©s through specific symbolic texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Idea-rich but emotionally distant; cohesive around assigned elements though their interplay lacks narrative urgency; stylistic ambition occasionally overshadows character/story integration.</comment>
