<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations stated but not deeply demonstrated through specific actions. "Atypical" trait inconsistently applied. Reactions to key objects feel symbolic rather than psychologically authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; events float without clear causal progression. No discernible resolution or character development arc. Meandering pacing detracts from narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethereal plains create evocative atmosphere with rich sensory details, but worldbuilding feels self-consciously "poetic" rather than organically revealing cultural/physical logic. The setting overshadows narrative functionality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overwhelm emotional engagement. Metaphors like "sky heavy with raw solace" recur mechanically. Theme of autonomy surfaces but lacks visceral exploration through concrete character experiences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Excessive flowery abstractions ("whispered promises of transformation") suggest artificial construction. Tropes of post-apocalyptic mysticism combined predictably. Emotional impact diluted by over-idealized language. Psychological nuance absent in character portrayal.</comment>
