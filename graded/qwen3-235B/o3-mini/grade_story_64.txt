<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and passive, motivations are stated but not demonstrated through meaningful actions. Lacks emotional depth and distinct voice, functioning primarily as a vessel for thematic concepts rather than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure lacks causal progression; repetitive imagery replaces plot development. No discernible arc or resolution within the constrained form, with disconnected vignettes failing to create cohesive narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lavish but inconsistent sensory detail creates immersive atmosphere. Some setting elements like floating marketplace integrate well, but temporal juxtaposition with "hush before verdict" disrupts logical cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors exist but lack narrative grounding. Central theme of immortality's cost receives surface treatment rather than genuine exploration. Poetic language compensates somewhat for thin characterization but fails to create emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies on excessive ornamental prose and circular phrasing ("map forest trails," "technically wild" without clarification). Tropes combine randomly without meaningful subversion. Emotional resonance remains superficial despite attempts at thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overly stylized language masks narrative emptiness. Elements exist in superficial proximity rather than organic integration. Brief length exposes rather than enhances content, with no lingering intellectual or emotional impact to justify the constrained format.</comment>
