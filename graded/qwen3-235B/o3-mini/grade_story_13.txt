<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct traits; motivation is vague and inconsistent with abstract actions; solemnity feels stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear narrative progression; cause/effect relationships are obscured by excessive description; ending lacks resolution, feeling more like a poetic transition than a thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with rich sensory details; the toppled clock tower and garden create striking imagery but occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity and purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong poetic devices but weak emotional anchoring; theme of evolution remains abstract; relies on elaborate metaphor rather than earned emotional resonance or subtextual depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some inventive combinations (e.g., evolutionary tracking via garden wisdom), but excessive ornate phrasing borders on purple prose; repetitive structural cadence suggests formulaic rhythm despite unique elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story prioritizes aesthetics over cohesion; elements incorporated feel decorative rather than foundational; lacks evidence of rigorous authorial intent beneath the lyrical surface.</comment>
