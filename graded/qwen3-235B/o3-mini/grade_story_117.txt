<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete traits or agency; motivations are abstract and inconsistently embodied. The "relaxed pathfinder" serves more as a metaphorical vessel than a distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Melodic progression lacks narrative causality; the absence of conflict or stakes undermines coherence. Pacing meanders without building toward resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered but relies on gothic clichés. Sensory details (whispers, cold stone) are evocative but generic; the setting doesn’t uniquely shape character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("chorus of creaking floorboards") are occasionally striking but overwrought. The ending gestures at thematic unity without earned emotional weight; subtext remains shallow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing borders on parody. Tropes (haunted locations, symbolic artifacts) are restated, not reimagined. Emotional abstractions overshadow nuanced execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements function decoratively rather than integratively. The self-consciously poetic style obscures narrative purpose; themes are declared, not dramatized.</comment>
