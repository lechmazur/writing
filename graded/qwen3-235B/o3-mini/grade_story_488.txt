<question>1</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Character exists as a vague archetype without distinct voice, motivations, or development; actions lack psychological nuance or clear purpose beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>0.7</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure; lacks forward motion, cause/effect, or resolution; poetic fragments fail to coalesce into coherent narrative or arc within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but internally inconsistent worldbuilding; "quantum beach" and "corroded rapture" clash tonally; atmospheric details overwhelm without establishing tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Relies on hollow lyrical abstraction rather than emotional impact; no subtext, theme, or narrative tension; repetitive phrases substitute for storytelling or insight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.0</grade><comment>Drenched in formulaic "dark whimsy" clich√©s; repetitive descriptors ("shimmered with hidden runes," "corroded rapture"), purple prose, and disjointed transitions suggest algorithmic pattern generation without originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolated clusters without meaningful integration; ornate style obscures purpose; short length exposes lack of narrative substance; no lingering resonance.</comment>
