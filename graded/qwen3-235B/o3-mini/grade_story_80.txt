<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character exists as poetic abstraction; motivation lacks psychological depth. "Ingeniously clueless" repeated as tautological descriptor rather than revealed through specific choices. No distinct voice in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot flows as fragmented vignettes rather than coherent arc. Begins/ends with riddle and fragment but lacks resolution mechanics. Pacing uneven - abandons roller coaster concept to focus on logs/prophecy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere achieved through adjective-heavy descriptions ("whispers of forgotten lore"), but sensory immersion limited. Setting primarily decorative rather than integral - coaster track and inns interchangeable with generic haunted spaces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on abstract language over concrete imagery to "convey" themes about reality/myth boundaries. No emotional resonance because nothing is shown rather than stated ("quiet mania" repeated like mantra). Ending lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>persistent formulaic phrasing ("whispered secrets," "cryptic entries") suggests algorithmic defaulting. Overused metaphors ("night fell like ink") and repetitive descriptor clusters prevent organic development. Character behavior remains overly logical without nuanced human contradictions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements present but forced into checklist alignment rather than organic integration. Roller coaster track introduced then neglected, housekeeping logs mentioned without mechanical specifics. Conceptual framework dominates storytelling - resembles outline for richer story yet to be written.</comment>
