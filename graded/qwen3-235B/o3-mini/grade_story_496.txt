<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's repression and poetic motivation present but lack psychological depth; emotional progression feels more symbolic than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a vague arc from hesitation to resolve but struggles with condensed pacing; the ambush scene lacks clear structural buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with decay/beauty contrasts but relies on clich√©d "nature reclaimed urban" imagery without specific, grounding details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (fragrance, cosmic verse, etc.) evoke layered meaning and emotional resonance, though abstract language sometimes obscures direct reader connection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Language frequently lapses into overwritten phrases ("veil of nature," "immortal and profound") that prioritize ornamentation over narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesion exists at conceptual level but feels strained; thematic elements (decay/rebirth, fear/art) resonate but structural tightness suffers from prose density.</comment>
