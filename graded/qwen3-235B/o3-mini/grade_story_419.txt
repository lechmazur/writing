<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete growth or psychological complexity; motivation is stated but not deeply explored via actions or dilemmas. Traits like "no-nonsense" and "empathic" exist abstractly without nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pseudo-circular structure creates closure but lacks dramatic progression; atmospheric vignette without clear cause-effect or escalating stakes. Pacing is fluid but shapeless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visually rich, cohesive setting immerses reader through tactile details (cracked porcelain, spectral creaks). Timeframe and location intertwine with themes of decay and preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uses recurring metaphors (heartbeats, fractured light) effectively, but over-relies on ornate abstractions over emotional subtext or conflict. Ending is poetic but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Verdant prose verges on purple; similes (e.g., "spark dances like memory") feel derivative. Sensory details lack specificity. Phrasing risks mechanical repetition of aesthetic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack friction; feels more like mood-study than narrative. Lingering tone is evocative, but depth is surface-levelâ€”theory without emotional backbone.</comment>
