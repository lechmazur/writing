<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character defined more by abstract descriptors than compelling actions; motivations (prophecy, denial) lack psychological depth despite poetic language.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vague cosmic arc exists but meanders; key elements introduced abruptly (patch, prophecy) with unresolved implications; pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lyrical atmospheric details present but undermined by undefined "thought experiment chamber"; inconsistent sensory integration weakens immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (bubbles as contradictions) work well; ending's philosophical revelation feels underdeveloped despite promising premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual inventiveness present but diluted by abstract phrasing; cosmic elements occasionally feel like decorative flourishes rather than organic components.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Successfully combines unusual elements but strain shows; brevity works against deeper exploration of thematic complexity.</comment>
