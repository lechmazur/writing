<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to outrun past misdeeds is clear but overly abstract; lacks distinct voice or psychological nuance; reactions to objects/thematic elements remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Narrative lacks traditional plot structure; poetic momentum supersedes coherent progression; cause-effect relationships obscured by excessive fragmentation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elegantly rendered sensory details (neon, rust) create vivid atmosphere, but setting functions more as clich√©d cyberpunk backdrop than an active narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "avalanche of misdeeds") impress; thematic coherence between isolation and urban decay resonates; conclusion feels artistically purposeful despite vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Rife with overwrought descriptors and repetitive motifs ("unfamiliar reflections," "rambling destiny"); emotional depth feels artificially constructed rather than organically conveyed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story struggles to synthesize assigned elements without contrivance; atmospheric prowess cannot mask structural diffusion; literary impact remains uneven.</comment>
