<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's actions align with assigned traits, but motivation lacks depth beyond symbolic gestures; voice is present but overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak narrative arc despite word limit; cause-effect between elements (e.g., elevator moment, bread scent) feels disjointed and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flora and sensory details create vivid atmosphere; elevator incongruity disrupts immersion but offset by lyrical setting descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (scissor as defiance, bread-as-memory) are potent; theme of renewal-through-isolation resonates but risks over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original use of elements subverts expectations; some ornate prose borders on purple but avoids AI-like repetition or clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a contemplative whole despite artificiality in certain pairings; style occasionally overshadows narrative clarity.</comment>
