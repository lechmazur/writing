<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Character is more symbol than human; motivations exist abstractly but lack concrete behavioral evidence beyond static descriptions. Voice dissolves into verbose abstraction. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Plot exists only as repetitive circumlocution; no forward movement, resolution, or discernible arc. Events recycle the same atmospheric stasis. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Erratic sensory details (e.g., "nude sky") create intermittent vividness, but tone undermines itself through contradictions (e.g., "sanctified dread" juxtaposed with absurd humor). </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on hollow metaphors and stated themes rather than evocative subtext. Attempts at profundity collapse under self-indulgent abstraction. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>0.5</grade><comment>Bloated with clich√©d poeticisms, mechanical repetition ("inner storms," "sanctified dread"), and hollow ornateness. Lacks human nuance or emotional authenticity. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Elements operate as dissonant checklist items; story lacks cohesion, momentum, or thematic unity. Feels algorithmically constructed around prompts. </comment>
