<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character traits are merely asserted, not demonstrated through actions. Motivation ("lost lullabies") lacks psychological depth or connection to the desert skull object. No distinct character voice emerges despite first-person potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No narrative arc or cause-effect progression. The assigned "action" of containment feels static rather than generating plot momentum. Beginning and end mirror each other rather than showing development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in the resonance facility and desert settings, effectively conveying mood. However, atmosphere often dominates over narrative purpose, with elements like fluorescent lighting and humming machinery not integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery but shallow emotional impact. Relies more on lyrical prose than narrative craft. Ending offers philosophical statement rather than thematic culmination. Shows more than tells but lacks deeper emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate language with numerous adjectives creates purple prose. Repetitive phrases like "relentless longing" and "haunted by memories" suggest formulaic writing. Metaphor of "lost lullabies" remains unoriginal and surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Cohesion fails due to lack of narrative drive. Elements exist side-by-side without synergistic interaction. Brevity feels like limitation rather than choice. Minimal lingering impact beyond atmospheric impressions.</comment>
