<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's "baffled" state and obsession with societal defiance are vaguely stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; the ventriloquist dummy's influence lacks psychological specificity; no distinct narrative voice emerges despite poetic interludes</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on ornate abstraction rather than causal progression; poetry sessions feel ritualistic but disconnected from concrete character development; abrupt shifts between atmospheric description and thematic declarations undermine narrative continuity; incomplete sense of transformational arc</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (damp machinery, flickering oil lamps) create visceral immersion, but supernatural elements lack internal logic; setting's mechanical decay mirrors thematic concerns, yet spectral occurrences remain ungrounded; sensory richness contrasts with conceptual vagueness</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical language dazzles but rarely coheres; phrases like "shattered despair" border on clich√©; themes of artistic defiance surface abruptly rather than emerging organically; ending's triumphant tone disconnects from preceding existential ambiguity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on gothic tropes (Haunted Lighthouse, Ventriloquist Dummy) with minimal subversion; poetic declarations function as emotional shorthand; "between appointments" timeframe feels arbitrarily inserted; language often sacrifices coherence for lyrical excess; lacks authorial fingerprint beneath aesthetic flourishes</comment>
