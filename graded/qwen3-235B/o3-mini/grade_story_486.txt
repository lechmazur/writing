<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (clumsily dexterous sound engineer) are abstractly tied to actions but lack psychological depth. Motivation for "silent retribution" remains cryptic rather than compellingly layered; reactions to objects/concepts feel more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Assigned action (critique via pantomime) drives vague progression, but cause/effect lacks clarity. While cyclical structure bookends in the cauldron room, the 500-word arc feels compressed rather than purposeful; logical gaps hinder coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie tone complements mystical elements well, with vivid sensory contrasts (stained glass hues vs. malfunctioning lights). However, the witch's cauldron room and public square feel like disjunctive sets rather than interconnected spaces; "freshly erased chalkboard" timeframe is underutilized as metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich with poetic devices (e.g., "auditory tapestry"), but subtext about silencing oppression remains surface-level. Ending resolves symbolically but lacks emotional resonance; "showing" through gesture/sound is strong but undercut by overdetermined abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose relies heavily on dense, repetitive descriptors ("mystic finesse," "practical illusion") and clichéd phrasing ("whispered note"). Metaphors feel overwrought rather than fresh; emotional shading is stated, not demonstrated, with robotic precision in syntactic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist more than coalesce—stained glass and cauldron room suggest depth but rarely intersect narratively. Style occasionally elevates theme but too often obscures clarity. The brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional.</comment>
