<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lack of concrete events, rising tension, or resolution reduces narrative to static vignette; connection between beginning and end feels artificially imposed rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Constantly recycled adjectives (“ancient,” “shadowed,” “residual”) and parallel sentence structures suggest algorithmic writing patterns; thematic coherence sacrificed for excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story successfully binds assigned elements through relentless repetition of motifs, but lacks narrative momentum, emotional investment, or conceptual originality beyond checklist fulfillment.</comment>
