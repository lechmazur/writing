<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character remains a vague, poetic abstraction with little concrete action or psychological depth. Motivations are nebulous, stated rather than demonstrated, and interactions with objects/ideas lack revelatory impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure - entirely static and meandering. Lacks cause-effect progression, coherent arc, or satisfying resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through crystalline imagery and twilight metaphors, but setting's connection to character psychology remains overly literal and thematically underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong on poetic symbolism (wooden spoon/crystal contrast) but lacks emotional urgency. Ending circles back without meaningful progression or thematic crystallization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Relies on self-consciously ornate prose ("architecture of the mind") and abstract emotional descriptors. Frequently veers into clich√©d metaphors and AI-esque rhythmic repetition without human emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements present as disjointed set pieces. Narrative cohesion undermined by prioritizing aesthetic texture over organic integration, leaving no lasting thematic impression.</comment>
