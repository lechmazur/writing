<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character is described through ornate abstraction rather than revealed through concrete actions, motivations, or conflicts. Traits like "methodically chaotic" and "troubled by street wisdom" remain poetic descriptors without tangible demonstration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sprawling poetic imagery creates atmosphere but lacks structural tension or progression. No discernible arc, resolution, or meaningful cause-effect relationships. Descriptions replace plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent tunnel systems and coral alleys evoke vivid aquatic wonder, but settings remain static backdrops rather than active forces shaping character choices or narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on metaphysical abstraction and overwritten metaphor produces aesthetic texture over emotional engagement. Lacks tangible subtext or thematic payoff beyond surface-level rebellion tropes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival clusters and recycled mythic motifs ("runes," "reckoning") suggest formulaic embellishment. Sentence structures follow predictable cadences with minimal lexical invention or idiosyncratic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Element checklist compliance outweighs organic cohesion. Length exacerbates fragmentation of concept elements. Stylistic flourishes overshadow narrative clarity and emotional authenticity.</comment>
