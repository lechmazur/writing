<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than psychological; motivations are implied rather than deeply embedded in specific actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structureâ€”progression is atmospheric rather than event-driven, leaving coherence reliant on thematic repetition rather than narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is impeccably realized through precise, haunting sensory details that unify mood and environment into a tangible, oppressive force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Linguistic richness and thematic hints (identity reconstruction, legacy) intrigue, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction; tells more than shows.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes risk veering into purple prose; originality is undercut by repetitive metaphors ("wounded season," "labyrinth") and a reliance on melancholic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but unevenly executed; cohesion exists but is strained by abstraction masking underdevelopment.</comment>
