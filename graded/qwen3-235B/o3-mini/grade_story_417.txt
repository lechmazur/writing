<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (strength through vulnerability) is stated rather than demonstrated through action; zealous fervor lacks contextual grounding; bottle cap fixation remains symbolic but underserved by concrete behavioral details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pacing lacks urgency despite tight span; thematic coherence exists but feels imposed rather than organically driven; plot resolution through whispered confession appears artificial, disconnected from earlier scholarly tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Victorian/jungle juxtaposition offers intriguing contrasts but underutilized; sensory details present yet often generic; stained glass and rustling foliage establish mood but lack visceral specificity that could deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story leans on paradoxes for thematic weight but struggles to balance erudition with eccentricity; metaphor density distracts from emerging through-line; final image achieves emotional resonance through symbolic convergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose occasionally lapses into contrived phrasing ("jungly night unfurled") but largely avoids formulaic structures; character psychology remains opaque rather than mysteriously nuanced; subtext about academia's stagnation feels timely yet surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds narrative execution; assigned elements cohere more aesthetically than structurally; lingering thematic questions about vulnerability's revolutionary potential suggest depth, though development remains suggestive rather than conclusive.</comment>
