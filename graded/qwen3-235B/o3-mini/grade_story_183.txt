<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paper-thin characterization; motivation is stated but never dramatized through action or internal conflict. The protagonist functions purely as an emblematic figure with zero psychological depth or emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Amorphous structure with no discernible rising action or resolution. Plot progression relies on poetic abstraction rather than cause-effect dynamics, resulting in a static, directionless narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically disconnected setting; the fractured dimensional rift and mosaic tiles create effective atmosphere but exist independently of plot or character development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overreliance on overwritten metaphors (e.g., "cosmic sonnet") dilutes impact. Some poetic resonance evident, but lacks emotional stakes or narrative tension to sustain reader engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stilted, self-consciously literary prose veers between banal abstraction and overwrought descriptors. Recycled mythologizing tropes undermine originality despite attempts at philosophical depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Element list checked but not cohesively articulated. The story reads as a loosely strung sequence of atmospheric fragments rather than an integrated artistic vision.</comment>
