<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's naive hopefulness and motivation to reclaim lost identity are present but underdeveloped; reactions to objects and conflicts lack psychological depth or distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through atmospheric descriptions but lacks clear cause-effect; abrupt shifts between poetic imagery and action undermine coherence within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Echoing "cryptic frequencies" and "agonizing bliss" create mood, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid; setting doesn't actively shape character decisions or thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Metaphors about cycles of regret hint at theme but remain surface-level; emotional impact diluted by abstract language; ending lacks narrative inevitability or subtextual richness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relies on overwrought phrases like "agony of hope" and repetitive motifs; lacks linguistic originality; transitions between abstract imagery and plot feel algorithmically formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't organically intertwined; prose prioritizes style over meaningful cohesion; fails to transcend assigned components' checklist-like integration.</comment>
