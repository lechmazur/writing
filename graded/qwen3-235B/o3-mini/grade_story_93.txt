<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains an opaque, melancholic archetype; motivations are abstractly stated rather than dramatized through specific actions or conflicts. Lacks distinct voice or psychological dimensionality</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into static vignettes; no progression, climax, or resolution. The labyrinth becomes a metaphorical dead end rather than a structural framework</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with decay and mystery, but sensory details are over-concentrated on sight/hearing while neglecting tactile/embodied experiences</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echoes of existential themes resonate faintly through lyrical language, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction and lack of narrative stakes</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate prose borders on self-parody; repetitive metaphors and formulaic transitions undermine authenticity. Attempts at profundity feel algorithmically assembled</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially without generating narrative cohesion or thematic urgency. Style substitutes for substance in this hollow, labyrinthine exercise</comment>
