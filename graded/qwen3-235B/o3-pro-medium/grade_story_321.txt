<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivations exist but lack tangible grounding; actions driven by abstract guilt and cosmic debt rather than fully realized psychology. Dialogue absent, 'voice' conveyed through vague interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Logical progression from contemplation to ribbon offering drives plot. Tight structure achieves closure but rushed transitions between metaphysical concepts undercut emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Visceral imagery overwhelmed by excessive abstraction; atmosphere of torment exists but fails to organically support character/plot. Sensory details often disconnected from narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphor density, with recurring ribbon/spool and boiling imagery creating thematic resonance. Ambiguous cosmic justice system provokes philosophical engagement through layered symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "abrasive calm" and "vinegar hissing like doubt" feel freshly invented. Emotional states implied through actions (e.g., salt on conscience) avoid explicatory shorthand. Unconventional cosmic punishment logic avoids genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>High-concept elements (hourglass, substitution redemption) suggest creativity but feel artificially assembled. Atmospheric grandeur contrasts with underdeveloped emotional throughlines; thematic ambition outpaces execution.</comment>
