<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Premise obscures character. "Dutiful sentinel" role is symbolic gesture, not motivation. Actions driven by abstract imperatives rather than psychological consistency. Voice exists but lacks nuance beyond metaphysical posing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Central action (destruction) propels plot, but restaurant sequence feels tacked on. Pacing stumbles during abrupt transition from exposition to climax. Concept shapes directionality but lacks organic escalation. Final act resolution feels poetic but structurally abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lab setting functions as atmosphere-bearer, not character. Futuristic elements (heliophore) underdeveloped. Sensory details abundant but unevenly distributed—wedding toasts' tactile specificity contrasts with lab's vague "lightless smoke." Timeframe disjunction between apocalypse and ceremonial setting creates tonal whiplash.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor (photosynthesis=narrative; marriage=stale metaphor). Language dazzles through precise, unexpected connections. Subtext about creativity as survival is potent. Occasional linearity sacrifices emotional grounding. Ending's thematic resonance transcends plot thinness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes border on mannerism—some phrases ("unborn dawn") echo previous authors too closely. Emotional subtext conveyed through absence but lacks grounding. Avoids major tropes through fusion of science/poetry but occasionally sacrifices clarity. Nuanced? Yes. Flawless? No—purple prose shadows undermine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Unorthodox elements coalesce into intellectually stimulating whole. Sacrifices psychological urgency for conceptual ambition. Lingers conceptually but not emotionally. Word limit reveals both discipline and omission—crucial character context gets sacrificed for poetic density.</comment>
