<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but somewhat abstract, leaving emotional connections underdeveloped. The juggling skill ties to plot mechanics more than personality depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent arc with clear beginning/end parallels, but the 'tea leaf' method feels contrived. Pacing manages tension effectively despite tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vividly rendered void environment with exceptional sensory textures (phosphorescent dust, brined paper) creates immersive atmosphere that meaningfully shapes character actions and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (juggling as ancient language, rewritten letters as rebirth) and powerful thematic layering of cultural preservation. Some emotional beats could use more grounded execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally original imagery avoids genre tropes, though occasional ornate phrasing borders on indulgence. Offers fresh interpretations but maintains narrative clarity amid lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>All elements present and contributing, though some (tea leaves) feel appended. Creates lingering philosophical questions about cultural transmission through unconventional means and art-forms.</comment>
