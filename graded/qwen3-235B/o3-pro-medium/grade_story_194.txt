<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strength: Bastien's rugged-philosopher duality is vividly implied through tactile details like "calloused palms" and cyclical forest imagery. Weakness: Motivation to learn healing traditions feels underexplored beyond surface plot, with inconsistent emotional weight in his transformation from lumberjack to time-culinary messiah.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Strength: Conceptual momentum exists through coded letter's threat. Weakness: Plot logic collapses under scrutiny - sudden leap from finding a bone message to manipulating timelines via broth lacks narrative scaffolding; key transitions (e.g. kitchen doors closing, salt skulls) feel authorial rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Ossuary restaurant's bone-as-ingredient grotesquerie creates potent atmosphere, amplified by sensory alchemy like "pine resin" and "salt-bright skulls." Weakness: Contradictory tonal elements (gourmet service vs. post-war trauma) undercut cohesion; temporal mechanics of cliffside setting remain unexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Lingering metaphors (bicycle knives, felled forests' forgiveness) and cyclical structure create thematic resonance. Weakness: High-stakes time manipulation feels abstract; emotional impact diluted by overused hyperbole ("sharks in broth," "bruised timelines") and underdeveloped central conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Fresh premise blending culinary alchemy with time travel. Weakness: Purple prose ("screaming forests," "dusk-stung embers") and overly ornate metaphors occasionally undermine emotional authenticity; some character reasoning (Pallas's panic) seems conceptually expedient rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through persistent bone/forest/time imagery, but uneven pacing and under-resolved thematic tensions limit its transcendence. The ossuary concept particularly demonstrates concept-driven storytelling exceeding technical polish.</comment>
