<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are inconsistently tied to traits; the forgotten noble's paradoxical existence is intriguing but underexplored, making emotional stakes feel abstract rather than deeply earned. Her reactions lack psychological complexity underlying the existential loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot's surreal momentum relies too heavily on poetic abstraction, creating elegant moments but blurring cause/effect logic. The reassembly of stubs driving the narrative works metaphorically but strains practical coherence. The ending's shift feels abrupt due to insufficient setup for the protagonist's defining choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually intense worldbuilding through combustion metaphors, burnt artifacts and digital intrusion creates vivid juxtapositions. The lab's role as both sanctuary and prison enhances the theme. Sensory details create immersive atmosphere but occasionally overwhelm functional storytelling elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional symbolic precision in contrasting high-tech observation vs. human fragility. The drone-as-mirror metaphor crystallizes the theme. Final gesture with the A1 stub resonates as earned transcendence rather than contrivance. Emotional undercurrents emerge through subtle object choices rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structure but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic density ("ash-breathing" as character choice). Some metaphors ("regal ruin") border on archaism. The neural pathways between concept elements feel genuinely discovered rather than manufactured, though certain similes ("confessions sparks") risk clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements function more as conceptual counterweights than organic components, but achieve critical mass. The combustion setting and text message framework strain believability but enable thematic collision between analog/digital, permanent/ephemeral. The ending's lingering resonance justifies formal constraints.</comment>
