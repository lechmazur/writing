<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cal's transformation from sullen farmer to conduit relies on external plot mechanics rather than organic character logic; motivations are poetic but emotionally opaque, with minimal interiority to ground his actions in psychological reality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on surreal logic and lyrical momentum rather than causal clarity; structural coherence is sacrificed to poetic set pieces, though the arc mirrors the thematic erosion of boundaries between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visceral marine decay contrasts with mythic undertones through phosphorescent algae, rusted machinery, and drifting silt; atmosphere transcends typical post-apocalyptic tropes with tactile, synesthetic specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "console as philatelic altar") and symbolic motifs (stamps as "epistolary kisses to the abyss") create resonant subtext; ending risks didacticism but lands as a visceral thesis on boundary dissolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some phrases ("unforecast thunder," "coral-claimed statues") innovate clichés, but reliance on alliteration ("erased boundaries," "eccentric cartography") and overabstraction weakens emotional immediacy; inconsistent tonal shifts in final paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outpaces execution—the story's thematic skeleton shows through its lyrical flesh, making the whole feel more like a proof-of-concept than a fully vitalized narrative.</comment>
