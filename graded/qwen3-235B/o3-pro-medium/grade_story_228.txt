<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's skill with plants is integral but motivations lack psychological depth; emotional undertones remain surface-level despite vivid actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot propelled by storm and clothespin's use, with satisfying symmetry between the breach and escape; pacing falters slightly during escape sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bunker atmosphere meticulously rendered with sensory dissonances (industrial alarms vs. plant fragility); occasional stylistic excesses dilute emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical language (chlorophyll whispers, storm-struck applause) transcends clich√©; structural metaphor of constraint/improvisation mirrors protagonist's arc flawlessly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sufficiently avoids genre tropes through idiosyncratic imagery ("moss as stubborn prophets") but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing that obscures human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration mostly coherent though occasionally mechanical; final image possesses thematic heft but feels slightly constructed rather than organically earned.</comment>
