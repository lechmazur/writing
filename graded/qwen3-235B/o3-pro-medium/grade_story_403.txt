<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority; motivation is abstract rather than psychologically grounded, making the transformation feel symbolic rather than emotionally earned</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a mystical logic but sacrifices emotional stakes; the method of shelving doubt/uncertainty feels metaphor-heavy and narratively inert within the constrained arc</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, synesthetic details (ink-drop chandeliers, rippling-story corridors) create an immersive dreamscape where setting functions as active participant in the thematic calculus</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose layers paradoxes (joyful agony, listening to silence) that deepen the metaphysical subtext; the ending achieves philosophical resonance without didacticism</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceits like "clockwork lilies," though occasional overwritten metaphors ("pain wearing a carnival mask") risk gilded abstraction over visceral impact</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Story maintains cohesion through consistent tone and motif repetition, but character-driven narrative momentum suffers in favor of atmospheric spectacle</comment>
