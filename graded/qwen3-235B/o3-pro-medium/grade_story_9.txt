<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive but motivations lack psychological depth; actions serve plot logic over emotional plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Puzzle-box-driven plot progresses cohesively but relies on abstract cause/effect; closure feels conceptually neat rather than emotionally earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ominous, contradictory atmosphere of artificial neon vs. authentic desert magnifies through vivid tactile details and thematic setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ravishing metaphors (desert glass/consumption as betrayal) and ironic subtext elevate thematic weight; ending lingers but lacks emotional crescendo.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids clich√© but occasionally lapses into ornate abstractions; subtext shines, though sarcasm risks becoming tonal monochrome.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration strong overall but unevenly prioritized; succeeds as linguistic spectacle yet leaves character psychology under-baked.</comment>
