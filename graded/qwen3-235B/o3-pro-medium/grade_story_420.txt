<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character shows some depth through interaction with puzzle ring and fossils, but interiority remains sketchy. "Excited boredom" motif is present but lacks sustained exploration. Motivation exists but isn't fully interrogated beyond surface-level yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from frustration to creation, but the implosion-to-installation transition feels slightly rushed. Use of acetate/bark method requires narrative logic leap. Beginning/end connection via "single note" lingers effectively but lacks structural reinforcement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with fossil/darkness/light contrasts and oak's textural memory. Overwritten phrases like "fossil constellations" threaten coherence, but sensory details (corrugated bark, concentric shadows) create strong environmental identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual metaphors (puzzle ring=entrapment; light=clay) offer thematic resonance. Ending's paradoxes ("theoretically free") intrigue but emotional impact remains intellectualized. Subtext about artistic boundaries is present but under-kinestheticized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in light-as-creative-medium approach. Avoids most clich√©s through specific imagery ("photon clay"), but some phrases ("brewing thunder yawn") risk poeticizing vagueness. Emotional nuances are shown through actions more than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into unified concept-driven piece. brevity works for mood-based narrative. Lingering questions about permanence vs. impermanence add thematic weight. Some ideas feel underdeveloped but serve overall poetic effect rather than undermining it.</comment>
