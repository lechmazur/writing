<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is cryptic but consistent with surreal tone; the mystic remains an enigmatic device rather than a fully developed figure, while Mara's internal conflict about archival rebellion is hinted but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows dreamlike rather than linear; the override as inciting incident and Mara's rooftop resolution create loose circularity, but the middle relies on atmospheric transitions rather than concrete narrative progression within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally textured setting with synthetic biology's synthetic coral and "fluorescent silence" creates immersive cognitive dissonance; the lab-as-heritage-space concept feels fresh and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "telomeres as fading ink" ache with haunting specificity; the closing image of Mara stepping into tomorrow-smelling corridors offers thematic payoff through poetic juxtaposition rather than explicit explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality thrives in molecular genealogies and magnetic compass mapping genomic futures; avoids genre tropes but dances close to "mad scientist" clich√©s with the funding council's shallow antagonism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Integrates assigned elements with symbolic precision even as some (mystic, timeframe) serve as mood rather than mechanics; leaves a lingering question about memory's physicality in scientific practice.</grade>
