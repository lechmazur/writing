<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is thematically consistent and possesses a clear arc, but internal conflict is conveyed through stark poetic abstraction rather than nuanced psychological realism, making motivations feel archetypal rather than deeply individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent mythic structure with clear beginning/middle/end, but some transitions between discovery phases lack concrete logic (e.g., library scraps immediately revealing staircase). Tension dissipates in final third.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s strongest element—sensory details like weeping ice art and glass-enslaved flames create persistent dread and wonder. Setting actively shapes narrative rather than merely surrounding it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (black ice mirror, storm-commanding folklore) and thematic layering about power’s cost are powerful, but occasional overreliance on ornate similes somewhat dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in ephemeral structures and unconventional safe design is notable, but phrases like “echoed like coins” and revenge fantasy resolution lean into familiar arcs rather than subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are artfully integrated to support the theme, though some feel conceptually strained (prophecy scraps, library connection). The concise form serves the mythic tone rather than limiting it.</comment>
