<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Beneath the archer’s apprehension lies a veneer of competence, but inner conflict remains superficially sketched. The "usually exceptional" trait lacks integration with key action, and the candle-driven “compassion” feels imposed rather than organically demonstrated through decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots on a serendipitous encounter that strains credibility but efficiently accelerates tension. Resolution via coolant sabotage is clever but under-earned; the tight word limit allows momentum but leaves cause-effect gaps. Beginning/end linkage hinges on borrowed metaphors rather than structural symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cyberpunk setting thrives in sensory specifics—neon on fractured skylines, flickering holograms, metallic drone scents—while "borrowed dawn" permeates tone through recurring light-as-deception motifs. Atmosphere transcends genre tropes through visceral, layered texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (arrow as archival tool, candle as cyclical resilience) deepen narrative. The ending’s tempered rebellion avoids didacticism, balancing action with philosophical undercurrents. Voice occasionally veers into overwritten abstraction ("petabyte strata revolved in vertigo spirals"), diluting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids archer-in-cyberpunk clichés via symbolic fusion (graphite arrows etched with code), but the hot air balloon setup reeks of plot contrivance. Language balances lyrical precision with cyberpunk grit, though some phrases ("silicon and secrecy") evoke generic echoes of AI-crafted phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Element integration—while occasionally strained—ultimately fuels narrative cohesion. The compressed form amplifies existential stakes, and the candle’s symbolic throughline suggests authorial intent beyond checklist-compliance, though deeper character psychology would elevate it further.</comment>
