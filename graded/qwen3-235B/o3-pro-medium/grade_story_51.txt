<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in contrasts between violence and vulnerability, but underdeveloped nuances in Mason's psychological trajectory. Dialogue reveals core connection but lacks emotional texture in motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elegant symbolic progression but structural strain under word limit: pivotal museum encounters exist only as narrative ghosts. Resolution feels rushed despite poetic execution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Electric garden's tactile menace and beauty create visceral atmosphere; sensory fusion of danger and catharsis through charged soil and ionized blooms sustains thematic tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("sparks like applause") and symbolism (burning crate slat) carry emotional weight. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks gut-punch intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing ("winter pennies") borders on affectation. Avoids major tropes but occasional abstraction ("rationally subjective") risks artificial profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unorthodox elements cohere into emotional throughline but feel artificially assembled rather than organically discovered. Conceptual ambition outpaces earned emotional investment.</comment>
