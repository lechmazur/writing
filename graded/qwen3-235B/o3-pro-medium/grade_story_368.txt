<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a street orphan seeking hope is established but lacks deeper exploration of how survival shaped their psyche beyond surface-level trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but leans too heavily on abstract logic; resolution feels earned yet occasionally sacrifices cohesion for poetic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere with meticulous sensory details; the temple's decay and surreal beauty immerse the reader in a mythic liminality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and subtext; themes of duality and rebirth emerge organically through precise, resonant imagery and tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in texture but occasionally risks obscurity; some metaphors border on self-indulgence, though most choices feel intentionally stylized rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements unify around a central metaphor, though certain connections (e.g., "unwritten calendar") feel underdeveloped; resonant but imperfectly fused.</comment>
