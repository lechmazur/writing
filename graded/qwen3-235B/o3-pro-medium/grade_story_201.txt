<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Calla’s impulsiveness drives her acrobatic recklessness and improvisation, but her emotional depth beyond determination feels thin. Motivation is clear, but her internal struggle against inherited shame lacks visceral development; reactions to the music sheet lean more on symbolic resonance than layered character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a clear arc (ascent, revelation, escape) but compression flattens tension; stakes hinted at through crumbling setting rather than narrative urgency. Shooting stars as a method feel conceptually poetic but under-explained mechanistically. Pacing balances action and atmosphere but leaves little room for thematic expansion within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dusk and the ruined fortress create a mythic, precarious mood. The waterfall’s sensory presence (mist/sound) and celestial details immerse the reader. However, the fortress’s "recognition" of her feels slightly fantastical without earned emotional resonance. Atmosphere strongly supports the theme of rediscovery but occasionally overshadows character nuance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose blends lyrical metaphor (e.g., "notes darting like swallows") with rhythmic momentum. Subtext—intergenerational trauma, truth as harmony—resonates without didacticism. Ending ties back to legacy and justice effectively. Conflict is resolved too neatly, but the musical motif elevates the narrative into something thematically resonant and memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some sentences lean on ornate phrasing ("spray glittered like scattered jewels") that borders on purple prose, and the fortress’s sentient reactions risk cliché. Emotional beats often surface through action rather than interiority, but the core concept (music decoding injustice) avoids predictability. Sensory details are vivid yet occasionally generic, favoring style over raw human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>While reliant on fantastical elements, the story’s fusion of music, ancestry, and cosmic revelation creates cohesive emotional logic. The concise format serves the epic-parable tone well, though some character depth is sacrificed. Originality shines in the celestial-melody fusion but remains grounded in familiar redemption arcs. Lingers in its atmospheric metaphor.</comment>
