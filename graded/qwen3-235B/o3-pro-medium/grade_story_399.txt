<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While Garrick’s grumpiness is established, his transformation feels rushed and under-explained. His resistance to introspection aligns with his gruff nature, but the sudden emotional release lacks sufficient buildup. His voice is distinct but minimal dialogue weakens depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (summoning, ritual, resolution) but the tight word limit strains the pacing. The opening and ending tie together, but the shift from defiance to quiet acceptance feels too abrupt. The sand mandala’s role drives the plot, yet cause-and-effect in Garrick’s shift is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The witch’s chamber and crypt are evocatively described, with sensory details like “midnight incense” and “soot” creating an eerie, spiritual mood. However, the crypt’s mossy atmosphere feels underutilized. The tone complements the theme of buried trauma, but the setting occasionally veers into overwrought aestheticism without emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose employs striking metaphors (“cosmos folded its tents”) and symbolic resonance (ash-to-soil, the sealed tube as a “lantern”). The theme of confronting trauma is clear, though the didactic delivery (“the sky does not forget darkness”) undermines subtlety. Emotional impact is strong, but the ending’s abruptness lessens its weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with original elements like “multiply singular” and “cataract of constellations.” However, phrases like “decades of formaldehyde” risk overwriting. The metaphor of the mandala as a mirror is fresh, but Garrick’s epiphany leans on generic spiritualism. Emotional nuance is hinted at but often stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements with ambition, but cohesion falters. The ritual’s urgency and Garrick’s transformation feel strained by the word limit. While the poetic style elevates the premise, the density of imagery occasionally obscures emotional clarity. Leaves an impression but lacks a fully realized arc.</comment>
