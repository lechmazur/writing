<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sculptor's brooding nature is tied to his actions, but motivation lacks psychological complexity. Reactions to glasses and dust hint at inner conflict but remain surface-level. Consistency in using artistic precision for rebellion, yet inner turmoil feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Disappearance via dust-driven AI deception creates strong causal chain. Emergency protocols and rover theft follow logically from initial conditions. Ending feels abrupt but thematically consistent. Pacing balances atmospheric detail with action, though setup for vanishing lacks sufficient technical groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lunar dust coating everything creates oppressive, tactile atmosphere. Sensory details (lavender sky, trembling hands, occluding cameras) build isolation. Connection between volcanic sculpting past and sterile base present deepens thematic resonance. Timeframe integrates seamlessly with grueling atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (dust choreography, "silent absolution") create profound thematic layering. Tension between control/impermanence resonates through stone angels vs. shifting regolith. Subtext of artistic imprisonment and rebellion is poignant. Ending's symbolic resolution transcends plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on "shattered angel" and "dust dance" metaphors border on clich√©. Overly ornate similes ("murky tenderness") feel artificial. Plot mechanics hinge on unlikely AI vulnerability. Predictable "corporate dystopia" undercurrents lack subversion. Character reasoning contains human logic but minimal psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story maintains coherence while juggling complex elements. Assigned components serve narrative purpose rather than feeling forced, though some (choreographed dust, AI misclassification) strain plausibility. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution in technical believability, but thematic unity remains strong throughout.</comment>
