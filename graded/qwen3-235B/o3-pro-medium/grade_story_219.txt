<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sparse character agency; fading champion’s internal life hinted through symbolic actions but lacks concrete emotions or tangible traits. Motivation to map consciousness flows remains abstract, undercut by excessive metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structure is conceptually coherent but pacing uneven—origami/swan buildup is meticulous, yet emotional beats (e.g., shift to stewardship) feel rushed. Thematic bookend with the broken clock works but strains within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, surreal atmosphere anchors the narrative. Sensory details (brittle hush, bioluminescent rivers) immerse readers, but the mysterious island’s lack of physical specificity weakens its symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (consciousness flows, doubt whirlpools) and lyrical cadence elevate the storytelling. Ending’s thematic unity—fading as migration—delivers emotional subtext without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality is undercut by sporadic overreliance on complex diction (“sorrow-delta”) and abstractions. Some imagery transcends cliché, but “realistically imaginary” straddles the edge of self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Story succeeds as allegory but risks obscurity. Elements are unified yet strain clarity; brevity enhances poetic tone but sacrifices concrete emotional stakes.</comment>
