<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Intrinsically tied to guilt, but emotional complexity remains superficial; motivations are clear yet lack layered psychological exploration. Redemption arc fulfills bare minimum but lacks visceral human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Convoluted plot logic with abrupt transitions (engine-gulls, stormglass highways); premise sustains momentum but sacrifices internal consistency for poetic imagery. Resolution feels tacked-on, not earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (salted clouds, frost-notes dripping blue light) create immersive dissonance; setting-specific metaphors (basalt ziggurats as serpents) amplify mythic undertones without excess description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes poignant duality of creation/destruction and guilt/redemption through lyrical metaphor; emotional nuance in droplets-as-memory but occasionally undermines itself with declarative sentimentality ("forgiving him in luminous hush").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Exhilarating originality with floating museums and stormglass highways avoids genre clich√©s, but leans too heavily on ornate descriptors. Metaphors (vine-as-accusers) work, but some phrases ("salted clouds") feel performative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesion amid fantastical elements achieved through thematic glue of ecological guilt, though structural economy strains credulity. Final image resonates but emotional payoff feels abbreviated.</comment>
