<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character actions contradict skittishness; motivation of subconscious exploration is presented but not meaningfully dramatized through actions; ballet shoes poorly justify reverence without explanation of connection</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc feels incomplete; loom operation lacks logical mechanics despite lyrical descriptions; cause-effect between dance and data streams unclear; abrupt ending with universal emotional reaction weakens coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lunar colony blended with Appalachian motifs creates compelling dissonance; brass spittoon and wooden loom imagery effective but tonal shifts between galactic grandeur and rural nostalgia feel forced at times</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>High ambition in blending dance with space tech but feels conceptually self-satisfied; elements serve each other intermittently; brevity strains narrative development; lingering impression relies more on individual images than integrated ideas</comment>
