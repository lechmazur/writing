<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is static concept rather than living entity; motivation exists as exposition rather than psychological depth; inanimate sentience remains abstract without internal contradictions or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic arc with clear beginning/middle/resolution; pacing occasionally hovers between poetic interlude and narrative; transitions between wonder and threat maintain coherence despite word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (e.g., "wire-wrapped crumb tray sled," "Euphrates tides") create vivid, layered atmosphere; setting functions as active character through its mathematically coded memory-rebellion; timeframe and tone interweave to amplify emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Imagery ("algorithmic prophets of probability"), thematic layering (memory vs. erasure), and synesthetic blending of math/poetry create haunting impact; ending resonates through cyclical structure and subtext about cultural preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids tropes in concept but wavers in execution; occasional ornateness ("anthropological thunder") risks distancing effect; emotional resonance exists through subtext rather than explicit emotional cues, though not fully sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Element integration leans toward symbolic over organic; some devices (lanterns, shouting silence) elevate narrative while others (toaster mechanics) feel decorative; style balances on ambitious edge without fully transcendent cohesion.</comment>
