<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation is hinted but not fully embodied through actions or decisions. The trapper's relationship with the "black hole of doubt" feels metaphorical rather than organically revealed through behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on poetic revelation rather than causal progression. Microfilm's decoding feels narratively convenient, undermining tension. However, the cyclical structure from silence to silence shows disciplined compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding thrives through tactile details like "flickering lamplight" and "creaked like a drunk gull." The setting's vertical dislocation from oceans creates fascinating dramatic irony, though the sea glass's origin remains unearned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visionary language ("radiance gathered around the sea glass") creates haunting metaphoric texture. The ending's thematic crystallization about loss reflecting potential hits with poetic weight. Lacks consistent emotional grounding despite aesthetic power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Creative metaphors avoid clich√© ("horizon jarred"), but occasionally slips into ornamental excess. The "gritty whimsy" occasionally fractures under its own conceptual weight. Avoids formulaic emotional beats through abstruse but purposeful imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves atmospheric cohesion despite fantastical elements. Some assigned elements (microfilm archives) strain believability. The economy of language impresses, though thematic resolution sacrifices depth for lyricism. Lingering impression of fragmented meaning remains potent.</comment>
