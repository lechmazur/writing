<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character exists as metaphor, not person—motivation remains abstract, never tethered to human need. No distinguishing traits beyond the assigned "restless" and a vague yearning. Actions follow mystical prompts without psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot flows like a fever dream—beginning and end connect via thematic repetition, but cause/effect logic dissolves in the middle. No real arc, just symbolic gestures. Pacing floats between languid and abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting drips with tactile decay: bruised skies, humming tiles, scent of distant moons. Sensory details dominate—walls feel touched, air smells lived-in. Atmosphere substitutes for narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with paradoxes (“soundless thunder”) and cosmic metaphors. Theme of language-as-creation emerges organically. Lacks emotional residue—an intellectual exercise rather than visceral experience. Ending resonates as cyclical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Transcends genre tropes with fresh imagery (“scars into vowels”) but overuses “mosaic” and “rift” to the edge of cliché. Style leans florid yet purposeful; minimal purple prose. Emotional subtext implied through abstraction, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Elements coexist but rarely entwine—hat box’s magic feels disconnected from the theatre’s mysticism. Brevity works for mystery but fails to connect symbolic beats. Lingering questions about language-as-power emerge, but lack grounding.</comment>
