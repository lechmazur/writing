<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations (stamps as evidence of connection, lullaby for magnets) are consistent with his portrayal as a wandering philosopher. Voice maintains distinct poetic quality. Some nuance lost in abstract motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear structure of stamp-scattering, collaboration, and separation succeeds within constraints. Pacing slightly uneven; ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Particle accelerator juxtaposed with human intimacy creates compelling tension. Sensory details (echoes, magnets' thrum, scent) immersive but occasionally clash in tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (stamps as sheet music, "soulmate audition") elevate narrative. Ending evokes lingering ache of transient connection. Minimal emotional telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in stamp/magnet symbology. Avoids AI tropes except for occasional line ("cyclotron breeze") that risks ornate abstraction over purposeful imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements serve dual roles (stamps as both plot device and metaphor), though particle acceleratorâ€™s thematic weight feels somewhat superficial despite poetic integration.</comment>
