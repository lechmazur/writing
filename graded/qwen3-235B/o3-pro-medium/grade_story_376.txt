<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ember's motivation to archive emotions is consistent but underexplored; her actions feel archetypal rather than psychologically specific, though her use of wine-as-instrument creates a memorable nexus of traits and purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear progression through the night provides structure, but the ending feels abrupt; the story sacrifices deeper causal complexity for poetic closure, which works within the word limit but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral Viking-hall details (raven carvings, "candied smoke") create a world that feels archaeologically imagined yet emotionally immediate, with atmosphere as active participant in the story's emotional transactions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("wine tasting... disguising deeper thirst") and symbolic inkwell use create strong emotional resonance, but occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction; the theme of preserving ephemeral emotion is poignant but unevenly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original in concept (emotion-as-archival-substance), but risks purple prose with "ferocious repose" and "iridescent fervor"; metaphors like "vintage" emotion feel fresh, while structural reliance on noir-esque seer tropes lessens impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Combines elements cohesively but leans heavily on atmospheric scaffolding; the story's strength lies in its sensory worldbuilding rather than narrative innovation, raising questions about whether the form serves the material or vice versa.</comment>
