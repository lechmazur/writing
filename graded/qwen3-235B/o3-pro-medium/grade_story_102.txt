<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spineless trait is stated but contradicted by decisive action; motivation of payment drives plot but inconsistently with passive characterization; character's reflection of flaws in glyphs feels narratively imposed rather than naturally revealed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but progression through forgotten trails lacks visceral engagement; resolution too neatly hinges on convenient skill (shadow manipulation) without prior setup; cause-effect of prophecy's suppression feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (chisel-sharp chalk smell, weeping horizons) permeate; setting's cartographic mysticism powerfully evokes wonder and claustrophobia; only minor tonal dissonance between "luminous doubt" and the story's pervasive shadowiness weakens cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Masterful prose with haunting metaphors (silver teeth as "consonants") and symbolic use of shadow/silence; theme of knowledge-as-danger pulses beneath; undercut slightly by occasional overwritten descriptors ("sepia forgetting" feels forced); ending resonates as thematic exhalation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Victorian key and cartographic mysticism breathe originality, but "spineless mercenary" and "forgotten trails" recycle archetypes; "luminous doubt" and "hushed prophecy" feel freshly interrogated; overreliance on "lambent" prose risks self-parody; emotional beats often told over shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Despite dense imagery, narrative purpose binds disparate elements cohesively; brevity amplifies mystery without sacrificing structure; worldbuilding feels lived-in but occasionally suffocating; memorable for stylistic audacity even when thematic depths remain just out-of-reach.</comment>
