<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations (uprising, decoding dreams) are implied but not deeply explored; their unique paradoxical trait is stated but rarely manifests in specific actions or conflicts beyond poetic descriptions of stillness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually coherent but lacks visible progression or stakes; the uprising's execution feels more like atmosphere than action, weakening the sense of resolution despite the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is immersive through precise decay details (dust motes, broken tech), but the countdown's stagnant timeframe creates eerie tension that occasionally hinders forward momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Metaphor-rich prose creates memorable mood and thematic layers (counters as resistance, light as quiet rebellion) but occasionally prioritizes style over emotional urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional rebellion mechanics (light-based communication), though occasional overuse of abstract phrases like "rebellious placidity" edges toward poetic vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements interlock well (spaceport decay mirrors dystopian control, microscope bridges science/magic) but the story's ambition exceeds its capacity for concrete narrative payoff in the constrained format.</comment>
