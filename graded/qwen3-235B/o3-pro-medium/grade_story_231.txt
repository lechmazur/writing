<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation and insufficient emotional depth undermine Hagar's character despite poetic gestures; sentimentality feels surface-level rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tightly constructed but occasionally strained by compressed pacing; some transitions between key plot points (palace → amphitheater → revolution) feel reliant on dramatic coincidence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elegant historical details coexist with vague cultural specifics; atmospheric flourishes (Euphrates voyage, ziggurat stones) contrast unevenly with underexplored Sumerian authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid metaphorical language ("justice’s invoice") and lyrical symbolism enrich the narrative, but thematic simplicity and sentimental resolution soften its conceptual bite.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in blending mythic motifs with moral urgency, yet occasional reliance on archetypal structures (noble shepherd vs. corrupt vizier) and self-conscious poeticism undercut its uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion survives element-heavy constraints, but thematic resonance and stylistic voice occasionally bend under pressure of mandatory components; shows ambition without fully transcending its construction.</comment>
