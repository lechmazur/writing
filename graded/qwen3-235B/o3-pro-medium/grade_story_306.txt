<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Harlan's motivation as a fame-weary former star is clear, but his internal conflict lacks deeper exploration beyond performative eccentricity. The character's "voice" in narration is distinctive but doesn't fully reveal psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect chain from map acquisition to cathedral climax, but compressed timeline strains logic (scanner decoding cathedral panes). Pacing balances urgency with poetic pauses, though the ending's transcendence feels hastily earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Electrified atmosphere through resonant details: vibrating machinery's hum, glass humming with spectral melodies. The vibration chamber's scientific dread contrasts cathedral's mystical ambiguity, creating layered sensory immersion that deepens themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fame as shattered glass, ambition as musical currency) create thematic cohesion. Subtext about transactional ambition is strong, though final line's "dazzling anonymity" risks contrivance. Emotional impact resides in atmospheric symbolism rather than character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("neon rain" for data). Occasional "telling" mars immersive potential (e.g., "irreverent awe"). Conceptual originality shines, but some phrasing feels self-consciously surreal rather than organically visionary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements create potent thematic mosaic but integration feels curated rather than organic - the vibration chamber and cathedral's spectral glass particularly strain cohesion. The self-contained arc works within constraints, though character depth suffers from schematic symbolism.</comment>
