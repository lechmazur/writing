<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s internal conflict between obligation and self-doubt is present but underexplored; motivations are implied through symbolic objects rather than organic actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc, but progression feels episodic; transitions between scenes (e.g., repair task, alley journey) lack narrative momentum despite clever set pieces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imaginative worldbuilding merges technology with druidic motifs; sensory details (herbs, holograms, microfiche dust) enrich atmosphere without overwhelming the narrative’s emotional core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly crafted metaphors and imagery create emotional resonance; themes of obligation and imperfection as beauty are subtly woven, though some poetic excesses undercut clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through genre fusion, though a few phrases (“chlorophyll dreams”) border on ornamental; emotional subtext emerges via subtext rather than direct statements, maintaining nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive execution of assigned elements; the slim scope serves the narrative’s introspective focus, though the ending’s thematic revelation feels slightly under-earned.</comment>
