<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character depth exists but is surface-level; motivation to preserve craft techniques drives plot but "romantically doomed" remains unexplored, feeling like arbitrary adornment rather than integrated trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight plotting compresses heist mechanics effectively, but emotional arc feels truncated; connection between vault infiltration and resolution lacks earned weight due to limited character space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive worldbuilding through tactile metaphors (dust of footnotes, weeping key) creates haunting atmosphere; sensory details harmonize with thematic tension between sterile futurism and tactile past.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose (printers exhaling dust) achieves poetic resonance; subtext about artistic decay under technological progress emerges powerfully through physicalized abstraction rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through hybridizing tech-bureaucracy with artisan mythos, but "satchel of keys" leans on familiar motifs; occasional rhythmic repetition verges on artificial elaboration rather than organic language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exquisite component integration elevates structural coherence; each element functions as thematic or symbolic gear, though emotional impact slightly diluted by formal complexity's distancing effect.</comment>
