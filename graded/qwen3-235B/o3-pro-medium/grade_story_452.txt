<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characterization is evocative but underdeveloped. Core traits like softness and defiance are implied through actions, yet internal tension feels surface-level. Assigned attributes shape behavior but lack psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics hinge on surreal logic that works within the concept. Pacing is taut but some transitions (e.g., planetarium activation) feel conceptually compressed. Resolution aligns with premise's metaphysical rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting is visceral, original, and inextricable from themes. Sensory details like "rain-soaked neon" and "photon-projected constellations" create immersive, genre-defying atmosphere that elevates narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story employs layered metaphors (e.g., belt as narrative constraint/cosmic rebirth). Subtext about controlled narratives resonates. Ending is poignant, thematically unified. Emotional beats implied rather than stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through genre synthesis (cyberpunk occultism). Some phrases risk preciousness ("sirens into birdsong"), but voice remains distinct. Emotional nuances exist in actions, not explicit declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion emerges from thematic throughlines rather than structural complexity. Elements function more as symbolic gears than organic parts. Lingering power stems from imagery-textured ideas of communal storytelling.</comment>
