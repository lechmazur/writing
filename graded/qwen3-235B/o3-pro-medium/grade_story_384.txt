<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivation are present but underdeveloped; linking cooking to tectonic prophecy is unique but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weave of earthquake mechanics and culinary metaphor maintains forward momentum, though some transitions (e.g., deciphering notches) feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dust, spice quakes, and Richter chart create rich sensory interplay between scientific and domestic realms; atmosphere is visceral and conceptually resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (scent as data, recipes as prediction) are fresh; the ending achieves thematic cohesion while leaving philosophical questions about truth and suppression lingering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No formulaic phrasing; uses "frenzied tranquility" and sensory contrasts inventively; avoids overdescription but occasionally risks abstraction ("impossibly conceivable" borders on pretentious).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements are mostly cohesive, but the walking stick cipher and seismic flavor notes border on arbitrary; brevity enhances tension without sacrificing thematic ambition.</comment>
