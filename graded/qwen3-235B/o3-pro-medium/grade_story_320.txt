<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's shyness doesn't deeply inform decisions; motivation feels imposed rather than organically tied to her diviner identity. The paradoxical "passionate disinterest" is conceptually intriguing but underexplored in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure works within constraints, but the social media trail feels narratively shoehorned. Connection between beginning/end is clever but lacks visceral stakes. Pacing balances mystery with resolution but stumbles during abrupt spectral duplication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery of barnacle-crusted ruins and kelp chimneys creates haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (quivering water, mourning-like sounds) brilliantly enhance the melancholic tone. Setting isn't just backdrop but active participant in cosmic recalibration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads of light, kelp-weaving) effectively convey theme of interconnectedness. Emotional resonance emerges through environmental shifts rather than exposition. Subtext about carrying collective regret through time works conceptually but lacks human-scale intimacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in neon crown/timestamped apologies hybrid aesthetic. Avoids clichés but occasionally indulges in overwrought imagery ("applause slowed to mourning"). Social media element risks modern cliché subversion but mostly succeeds through haunting context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</comment>Worldbuilding cohesion impresses despite genre blending. Some elements feel decorative rather than functional; prose occasionally prioritizes style over clarity. Brevity works for mystery but weakens emotional payoff of Lyshe's choice.</comment>
