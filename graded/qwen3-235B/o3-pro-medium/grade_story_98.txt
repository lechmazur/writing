<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness shapes actions but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel simplified despite effective symbolic use of ruler and dog. Internal conflict remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine structure works within constraints but pacing falters during abrupt initiation ritual; tapestry sequence lacks mechanical logic while ritual resolution feels rushed despite clever circularity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully conjures damp dread and esoteric mystery through tactile details (mossed bricks, serpentine script), though candlelit chamber verges on clich√©d secrecy tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Doubly layered metatextual tapestry metaphors, sentient typography, and ruler's symbolic duality elevate narrative; ending's paradigm shift from drifting to navigating achieves profound thematic unification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in mundane occultism but stumbles with secret society archetype; some poetic excesses ("dog walking and candlelight") but tapestry mechanics avoid algorithmic predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Element integration surpasses constraints; tonal consistency bridges street-level realism and mysticism; narrative economy creates lingering resonance about knowledge acquisition as performative alchemy.</comment>
