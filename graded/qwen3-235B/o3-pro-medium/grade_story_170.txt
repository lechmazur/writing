<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (free-spirited, herbalist) underdeveloped; motivation (to "hush shame") tied to backstory but psychological transformation feels rushed and under-nuanced. Internal conflict hinted at but lacks concrete manifestations through fully realized actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure cohesive but compressed; emotional shift from doubt to resolve strains plausibility within tight word count. Assigned action (memorizing letters) drives limited narrative arc, but cause-effect between emotional states lacks sufficient groundwork for complete satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion through marine imagery (tactile salt, visual coral hues, auditory waves) creates palpable atmosphere. Setting as active participant in emotional resolution; tidal rhythms mirror character's psychological shifts. Overly ornate descriptions occasionally threaten immersion but mostly enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (coral grafting as emotional reconstruction) resonate with thematic precision. Emotional impact achieved through lyrical synesthesia ("bright syllables," "barnacle's barb") and symbolic symmetry. Ending approaches sentimentality but retains poetic restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional lapses into lush abstraction ("pocketed tides," "archived coral") risk ornamental excess. Subtext of academic betrayal and environmental recovery expertly woven, but character's agency occasionally overtaken by poetic language demanding reader translation. Emotional states shown more than psychologically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story coalesces around core metaphor of repair but uneven element integration (abandoned wall's connection feels tenuous). Stylistic ambition elevates narrative beyond gimmickry; the synthesis of science and metaphor creates lingering resonance despite structural compression.</comment>
