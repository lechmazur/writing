<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character has thematic consistency but lacks emotional complexity; motivations are clear but underexplored. The 'analytically innovative' trait surfaces through unconventional decryption method, but inner conflicts remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but hinges on implausible cause-effect (scent decryption). The ending feels abrupt despite word constraints; thematic progression is clearer than narrative mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels via sensory details (rain, petrichor, flickering lights) but deeper connections between setting (tower, party remnants) and core themes feel superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates impact, but emotional resonance is diluted by excessive metaphor density. Subtext about bureaucratic complicity emerges, though not fully crystallized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally succumbs to overwritten imagery; the rain-smell decryption borders on novelty over logic. Balances originality with sporadic thematic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere structurally but strain believability; some feel like symbolic props (astrolabe, drive). Achieves mood over mechanical cohesion.</comment>
