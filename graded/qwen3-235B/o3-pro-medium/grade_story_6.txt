<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's reckless generosity is consistent but under-explored; motivations are clear but lack dimensionality; the armor's acquisition reveals curiosity but not deeper psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed but rushed; slingshot trigger works, but trickster's defeat feels abrupt; beginning/middle/end are present but compressed, sacrificing nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive, eerie atmosphere; setting directly shapes tone and theme (impermanence); timeframe and mailbox framing lack integration with core narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly evocative prose with layered metaphors; thematic cohesion around impermanence; ending resonates thematically; dialogue stylized but purposeful; some risk of ornateness overshadowing clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh subversion of trickster tropes; avoids predictability; language risks floridity but mostly remains purposeful; emotional resonance through atmosphere and subtext, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven but unevenly weighted; mailbox and timeframe feel peripheral; prose style elevates but occasionally distracts; ending provokes reflection despite brevity.</comment>
