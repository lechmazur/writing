<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character’s assigned traits remain surface-level; motivation for risking existence (matching forbidden texts) lacks psychological depth despite poetic phrasing. Internal stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Premise-driven plot follows logical progression but resolution feels abrupt. Pacing balances poetic description against action, though some causality (e.g., gravity slackening) disrupts momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Liminal atmosphere thrives on vivid sensory contradictions (e.g., "shelves aligning into constellations") and synesthetic details ("hissing static," "vibrating ink"). Setting transcends gimmick through thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("linguistic entropy," "flag-ripple broadcasts") create intellectual and emotional resonance. Ending’s thematic payoff—empathy as reality-warping force—transcends genre tropes. Subtly shows connection through ink-duet resonance rather than direct statement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Few formulaic elements; "jellyfish books" and "linguistic entropy" inventively reframe familiar magical library tropes. Some phrasing ("lament...broken Morse") risks over-precision but serves the story’s tonal paradoxs. Emotional subtext emerges through symbolic action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a self-contained mythos. The story’s greatest strength lies in suggesting vast backstory without explicating it. Minor issues include slightly underdeveloped thematic link between "between channels" and protagonist’s identity fluidity.</comment>
