<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amos' duality as a morally-ambiguous con artist with glimmers of redemption is internally consistent, but his transformation through the tape dispenser confession feels rushed despite resonant hints of psychological authenticity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral details like "crickets clicking like broken machines" and the mist-soaked cabbages create a haunting agrarian decay, with the barn's warmth contrasting mechanized surveillance to perfection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (tape dispenser gavel, remorse as tide) blend poetry with existential futility. The ending's "scissors of silence trimming regret" achieves chilling finality through layered subtext.</comment>
