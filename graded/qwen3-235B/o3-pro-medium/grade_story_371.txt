<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are compellingly sketched but lack deeper psychological complexity; motivation (debt resolution to shelter family) drives actions logically yet feels underexplored emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Compact structure with clear progression from quest initiation to climax; pacing is tight but relies on abstractly explained methods that slightly strain coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vividly imagined setting with cyberpunk-specific sensory details (neon, storm residue); some elements (e.g., marbles) feel slightly disconnected from the worldbuilding's mechanical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and metaphor density elevate impact; the ending's thematic resonance about hope surviving apathy feels earned. Slight over-reliance on aesthetic overload risks overshadowing emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original combinations (digital debts erased via acoustic relic, marbles as fate-maps) subvert expectations. Prose occasionally borders on ornate but maintains stylistic consistency rather than formulaic repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements serve thematic layering; the marbles/theft of memory motif particularly resonates. Minor hiccups in connecting the marbles' divinatory logic to the world's technology do not derail cohesion.</comment>
