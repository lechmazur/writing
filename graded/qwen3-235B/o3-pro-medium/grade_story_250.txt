<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Achieved through cryptic inner conflict and physical tics, but lacks emotional complexity; dialogue remains underutilized for deeper character revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent mytho-logic sustains momentum despite compressed structure, though some cause-effect transitions between mental duels and progression strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory alchemy (sputtering emerald bulb, candle wax-rusted keyboard) creates a transcendentally oppressive atmosphere of sacred decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphysical paradox as metaphor for intellectual integrity achieves haunting resonance; final dialogue subverts "chosen one" narrative tropes masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Occasionally overwritten ("errant sigels trembling like fireflies on morphine"), but mostly innovates by collapsing theological and mathematical abstraction into tactile horror.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegantly synthesizes esoteric elements into unified symbolic architecture; brevity serves the mythopoeic scope rather than limiting it.</comment>
