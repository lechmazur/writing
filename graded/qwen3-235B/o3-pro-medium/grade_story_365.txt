<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has poetic depth but lacks consistent internal logic; "independently dependent" is conceptually rich but underexplored in tangible motivations and relationships to other elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Braiding as action provides symbolic momentum, but the condensed arc sacrifices cause-effect clarity; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (glowing bottles, metallic clinks) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that deeply aligns with the melancholic tone and surreal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stylistic precision and metaphoric density evoke potent emotional resonance; the bittersweet transformation of history through sacrifice lingers with philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors avoid clich√© but occasionally teeter into excessive elaboration; emotional subtext is shown organically, though some imagery risks ornamental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive metaphor for historical redemption, though the rapid resolution slightly weakens structural completeness; the perfume-echo ending is haunting.</comment>
