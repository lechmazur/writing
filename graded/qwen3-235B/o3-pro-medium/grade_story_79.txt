<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks deep psychological roots despite poetic gestures; actions align with "ghostly resolve" but could delve beyond symbolic roles into human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows with escalating cosmic-poetic logic but strains credibility in chain-pulley mechanics; the word limit compresses time skips but maintains emotional payoff through metaphorical causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges scientific and poetic elements masterfully through tactile details (chalk outlines, fractured light), though the "scientific poetry library" remains conceptually underserved by the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Imagery ("chained light-bending eternity," "whisper-stanzas") creates haunting subtext; theme of quiet resurgence gains complexity through synesthetic descriptions of silence as active force.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Occasional overuse of hyphenated descriptors ("heat-drenched," "sun-spilling") edges toward mannerism; subtext thrives in atmospheric details but falters in explicit "despair vs. possibility" declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story transcends its ambitious elements through resonant metaphor but leans on symbolic shorthand rather than earned emotional authenticity; lingers more as mood than narrative.</comment>
