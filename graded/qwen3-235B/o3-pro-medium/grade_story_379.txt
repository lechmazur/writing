<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's traits (trickster, lawyer, cataloger) are conceptually present but lack psychological depth; motivations hinted but not fully dramatized through embodied actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plotted with tight logic but feels compressed; cause-effect chain coherent but emotional arc underdeveloped; middle-section momentum strong but opener/closer disconnects from payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Extrapolated setting richly textured with precise details (algal glass, hydroponic wheat) but rarely interrogates its own tech-biome tension as thematically active space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Verdant metaphors and paradoxical tone ("colder than vacuum yet luminous") create poetic momentum; thematic weight of linguistic preservation resonates; resolution lacks emotional culmination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Echoes of solarpunk and cyberpunk tropes revitalized through synesthetic imagery; linguistic anxiety motif fresh but some phrasing (e.g., "ghostly resolve") borders on clich√©-poverty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through atmospheric density over narrative urgency; elegant fusion of elements but lacks visceral emotional stake; lingers as conceptual exercise more than lived experience.</comment>
