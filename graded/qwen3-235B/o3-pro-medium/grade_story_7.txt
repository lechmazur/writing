<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (covenant with healing) is clear and consistent, but "expectantly resigned" trait remains abstract through static gestures rather than interior psychological conflict. Limited emotional evolution despite transformative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic hero's journey structure compressed into limited space. Star-guided navigation to vat climax feels inevitable. Resolution within word limit achieved through poetic compression rather than narrative beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion through nectar atmosphere blending sweet/bitter, mechanized hymns, and tactile descriptions of porcelain mortality. Sacred industrial decay setting amplifies both character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (mask-peeling as rebirth) create thematic weight. Ending transcends surface fantasy through existential transformation. Lacks dialogue to deepen symbolic layers into human-like relatability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No formulaic structures or generic phrases. Sensory details specific and inventive. Avoids AI-tendencies toward explanatory dialogue. Occasional line ("knitting fractures") approaches ornate simplicity but maintains stylistic consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>ELEMENTS (cane/necrotic geometry) serve thematic and plot functions simultaneously. Avoids checklist mentality in favor of symbolic interdependence. Time compression feels intentional rather than restrictive.</comment>
