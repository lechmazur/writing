<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's rebellious motivation is consistent but primarily symbolic rather than psychologically nuanced; voice is distinctive yet lacks emotional depth or believable contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot has poetic through-line from intent to resolution, but surreal logic and abrupt shifts (e.g., mannequin communication method) strain narrative cohesion despite imaginative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting achieves immersive grandeur through visceral, original sensory details (e.g., "electric ghosts," "corroded antennae kissing starlight") that enhance thematic tension between decay and transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally overwhelm substance, but metaphors ("still sea hiding volcanic thunder") and symbolic imagery create lingering resonance; ending's emotional payoff is compelling but abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking originality in blending cosmic and decaying machinery motifs, but stilted philosophical abstraction (e.g., "supernova psychology") and occasional syntactic excess hint at artificial construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric mood piece rather than narrative, with all elements coalescing thematically; some dissonance between literary ambition and structural brevity remains.</comment>
