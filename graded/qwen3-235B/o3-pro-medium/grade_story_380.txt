<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's identity as dream thief and math struggles shape actions and self-perception; connection between stolen dreams and thunder-summoning attempt reveals layered guilt and longing. Some symbolic gestures overshadow deeper psychological realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Circular structure from silence to thunder works within word limit; basketball ritual drives plot but some transitions (dislodged scroll) feel slightly convenient. Coherence maintained through motif repetition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rainless posthuman treehouse setting creates haunting atmosphere; sensory specifics like "damp paper" smell and "lazy lightning" scroll convey emotional desolation through environment. Timeframe's existential weight permeates effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("mirror missing a face") and symbolic interplay elevate execution; quiet desperation manifests through kinetic basketball rituals rather than exposition. Ending's numerical mastery reversal adds profound emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of dream-thieving with sports psychology and anthropomorphic weather; avoids AI clich√©s through idiosyncratic imagery ("storm generator in broken reflections"). Some descriptions risk ornateness but mostly serve theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singular vision binds all elements without superfluous parts; brevity enhances elegiac quality rather than limiting impact. Lingering meditation on memory/creation through fragmented forms resonates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
