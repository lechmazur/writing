<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt and desire for reconciliation are clear but underexplored; internal struggle lacks nuanced emotional layering despite strong symbolic elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc from decoding to ascent coherent but compressed; pivotal psychological shifts risk feeling abrupt within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decaying ship and pressure-filled atmosphere vividly rendered; sensory details (barnacled chandeliers, rust-air taste) immerse reader in melancholic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (ring as gyroscope, blanket as confession) resonate; healing as physical/emotional ascent offers potent metaphorical framework.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but skirts purple prose with elaborate metaphors; emotional resonance conveyed through tactile engagement with coded blanket rather than mere exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>High-concept fusion of guilt, coding, and aquatic struggle impressively synthesized; some narrative leaps suggest compression challenges rather than intentional design.</comment>
