<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations (capturing the comet, personal redemption), but their internal complexities remain underexplored; interactions lean on archetypes without depth, though the "lightly unbearable" motif provides faintly textured tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure exists within brevity, but the quest to collect melodies feels expedited; resolution hinges on abstract concepts ("haunted melodies" as deus ex machina) that strain logical cause-effect, despite atmospheric pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details (burnt violins, sparking portals) and the decaying dimension shop create a haunting, fully realized world; atmosphere amplifies thematic dissonance between transience/impermanence and human (vs. cosmic) scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical craft (key as history, melodies as emotional repair) elevates the narrative, though themes of trust/redemption feel surface-level; ending’s "cynical warmth" lingers, but emotional resonance lacks human messiness beneath the lyrical surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but veers toward ornate abstraction ("bruised fireflies embracing arrest") that risks preciousness; metaphors often fresh, but emotional beats sometimes "tell" rather than show, particularly Brill’s redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally, but thematic ambition (trust, impermanence) isn’t fully earned; brevity serves the cosmic stakes but limits deeper engagement with character interiority.</comment>
