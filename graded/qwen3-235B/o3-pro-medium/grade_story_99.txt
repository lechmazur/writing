<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character’s telekinesis and role as a bookbinder are present but underdeveloped; motivations are hinted at but lack emotional depth despite the self-aware farewell. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from manuscript revival to transformation, but the chopstick wrapper’s sound-triggered flashbacks occasionally disrupt pacing in the tight word count. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rusted carnival atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant, though the "lost legends" timeframe feels abstract and inconsistently applied. </comment>
