<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually tied to rebellion but lack emotional depth and nuanced interactions. Motivations are clear but underdeveloped within the brevity of the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is innovative but strained by tight word constraints. Pacing falters in the time-travel execution, with abrupt shifts diminishing narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (baking metaphors, garages humming with comets) create a mystical atmosphere, but inconsistent worldbuilding (time machine mechanics) weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (rebellion as dough, shadows as narrators) elevate the narrative. The ending feels thematically resonant but rushed, undermining emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of baking and revolution is original but occasionally overwrought ("cynically gentle" borders on self-indulgent). Sensory details lean poetic yet avoid excessive purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade>Tight integration of elements (baker, flowers, moon) succeeds thematically, but the time-travel device feels underbaked, straining credulity in its execution.</comment>
