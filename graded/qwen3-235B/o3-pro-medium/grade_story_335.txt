<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (redemption through omen), but emotional depth feels intellectualized rather than viscerally rendered. Supporting characters like the muralist lack dimensionality, existing primarily as narrative tools.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints, but the negotiation with the girl lacks tension or buildup, relying on contrived convenience. The circular structure (ending with transformation) works, though the pivotal decision feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is viscerally rendered: cathedral’s decay fused with vibrant street art enhances the tension between ruin and creation. Sensory details (kaleidoscopic wounds, aerosol ghosts) masterfully anchor the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (amber as ledger, silence as arrival) and haunting imagery elevate the prose. The ending balances resolution and ambiguity, though emotional impact leans on abstract concepts rather than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through surreal setting and poetic voice, but contains moments of overwrought phrasing ("color bruises"). Subtext about art as redemption is fresh, though the mercenary-redemption arc remains familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, with atmospheric details and symbolic objects driving the narrative. Some elements (rumor chains) feel functional rather than organic. The ending lingers thematically but lacks gut-punch resonance.</comment>
