<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character driven by abstract theological doubt remains underdeveloped; motivation to "revise destiny" lacks visceral grounding beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression maintains coherence but relies on poetic abstractions rather than concrete plot mechanics; resolution feels predetermined rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere succeeds through sparse imagery (vine pillars, snow calligraphy), but over-reliance on clich√©d "bean stalk" mysticism undermines originality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Escapes formula through synesthetic metaphors ("snow patterns" as divination) and rejection of predictable religious redemption arcs for existential mathematization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Conceptually integrated elements achieve thematic harmony, though some (giant bean stalks) function as decorative scaffolding rather than architectural necessity.</comment>
