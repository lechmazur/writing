<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's abrasively charming tone is consistent, and actions align with retrieving the light. However, emotional depth feels underexplored despite strong physical/behavioral details.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses from wallet to confrontation with Midnight, but cause-effect connections (e.g., phone booth's role) lack sufficient scaffolding within tight word limits. Resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival and shifting realities are rendered with precise, haunting sensory details. Atmosphere consistently deepens character tension and theme without a single superfluous adjective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "sock lost in static") and recursive structure (wallet ↔ carnival's emptiness) create profound thematic resonance. Ending balances mystery and closure with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-repetitive imagery ("raven feathers" from photographs) avoids cliché. Prose occasionally flirts with ornamentation but maintains stylistic coherence and emotional subtext through action over exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (wallet, carnival, transient realities) function as thematic throughlines rather than checklist items. Ending's emotional payoff feels earned but slightly under-earned through character development.</comment>
