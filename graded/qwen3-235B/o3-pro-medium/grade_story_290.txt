<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but psychological depth lacks nuanced exploration of Solun's ennui and its evolution; motivations drive plot but interiority remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion despite brevity constraints; lyrical prose purposefully embraces compression's constraints as artistic choice rather than limitation.</comment>
