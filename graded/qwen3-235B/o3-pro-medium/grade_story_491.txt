<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; emotions tied to abstract themes rather than specific personal stakes or visceral experience. Motivation to find wisdom exists, but reactions lack distinctive nuance or vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually driven but structurally compressed; transitions between ritual steps feel inevitable but underdeveloped. Closure is symbolic rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exquisite synthesis of texture, light, and metaphor creates immersive atmosphere; every sensory detail reinforces the theme of memory and fragile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, recursive symbolism ("geometry of yearning"), and haunting final image achieve profound thematic resonance. Subtext about wisdom's paradoxical nature elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original combination of speculative botany, textual archaeology, and tactile magic avoids genre tropes. Language is purposeful despite occasional poetic density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified artistic statement rather than checklist fulfillment. Conceptual richness compensates for character thinness.</comment>
