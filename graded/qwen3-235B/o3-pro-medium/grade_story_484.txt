<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ellis’ motivation as a brewer seeking to embody values is conceptually clear but underdeveloped; his actions feel driven by plot demands rather than organic depth, though his "flippant solemnity" voice adds texture without full integration into behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Modest cohesion in a tight arc—stumbling brewer to fortified protestor—but pacing compresses key moments (e.g., confrontation with darkness), leaving cause-effect relationships under-explained; the lull-to-climax structure works but strains under word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative, specific atmospheric details (generic-glow mausoleums, barley-scented defiance) enrich mood; the setting’s eerie tactile quality elevates the theme, though darker undertones occasionally verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Linguistic flair (fermentation metaphors, keg analogy) deepens theme; avoids overt sentimentality while embedding layers in action (e.g., mirror’s duality, protestor parallels). Ending resonates with symbolic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original brewer-protestor-darkness fusion contrasts AI-trope predictability, but uneven phrasing (e.g., "encroaching darkness" as vague antagonist) blemishes otherwise fresh conceits; emotional beats lean on metaphor over nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (brewer’s craft mirrors moral resolve) and the ending resonates, but reliance on abstract imagery over concrete stakes slightly weakens impact; length enhances focus but strains character depth.</comment>
