<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's quiet nature and motivation to preserve art are clear but lack deeper introspection or emotional complexity; actions align with traits but depth feels withheld for brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tight progression from hidden mission to resolution; cause/effect for mending's ripple aligns, though compressed pacing leaves little room for plot tension to breathe before catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and sensory fusion of lab-choir hybrid is immersive; copper corridors, humming resonators, and ash-like chalk-notations evoke tangible atmosphere that deepens emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors ("thread by invisible thread," candle-flame melody) deepen theme of art's quiet power; ending resonates as earned payoff, not mere sentiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formula; "mending art repairs the world" is original but occasionally edges into poetic abstraction that risks diluting emotional intimacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements like embroidered cuffs and choir-as-cover are integral to theme; cohesion is strong but slightly undercut by high lyrical density requiring re-reads.</comment>
