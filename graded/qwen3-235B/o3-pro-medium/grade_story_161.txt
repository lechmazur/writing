<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Florian's traits are vivid but could integrate deeper into motivations; his grief and conspiracy-driven actions feel plausible yet lack full emotional resonance within the brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tight plotting with poetic logic, though the abrupt transition to the peacock projection risks losing some causal clarity; resolution feels slightly rushed despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, layered atmosphere with sensory details (mist, clay imprints, rustling paper), but the hybrid orchard-research facility setting occasionally strains suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphoric density (peacock invoices, crumpling truth) create striking impact; some lines feel mannered, but the ending delivers catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors; avoids formulaic reveals but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing ("eye-spangled indictment") that could have been pared for sharper focus.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-concept storytelling with thematic heft, but the ambitious interplay of elements (conspiracy, grief, aerodynamics) occasionally tests narrative gravity within the word limit.</comment>
