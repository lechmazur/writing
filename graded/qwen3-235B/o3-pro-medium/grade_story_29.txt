<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weakness in consistent psychological motivations; strength in symbolic role-playing of knight’s naivety/hope duality but lacks humanizing contradictions. Assigned traits often function as labels rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective arc compression but strained pacing during frequency-synching climax. Assigned action (neutralizing) drives plot, yet the method’s mechanical logic feels abstracted from concrete consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally inconsistent—regret-melting into “orchards of possibility” risks tonal whiplash. Atmosphere excels in sensory details (burnt letters, humming cardboard) but thematic throughlines are hazy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., “laughter long extinct dancing again”) coexist with overdetermined symbolism. Ending resonates thematically but emotional payoff is more intellectual than visceral, leaning on poetic abstractions over earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creativity in “regret-melody” premise, but occasionally drowned in baroque metaphors (“moonsilver pears glowed like bottled sighs”). Avoids major clichés but occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aesthetic unity achieved despite eclectic elements—each piece serves the redemptive theme. Style occasionally obscures emotional nuance but overall balances high-concept ambition with narrative discipline.</comment>
