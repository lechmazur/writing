<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's dual motivations (artistic integrity and species-specific biology) create compelling contradictions, but some connections between chameleonic traits and emotional decisions lack sufficient psychological texture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot weaves mystery-solving with performance but struggles with compressed chronology. Logical connection between Zhao's revelation and reproductive climax feels rushed despite effective symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Post-oil palace is vividly rendered through tactile details (solar mirrors, paper gears) and atmospheric contrasts between decay and reinvention. Anachronistic synthesis feels purposeful rather than arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Successfully merges mythic and speculative elements with emotional heft. The chameleon's biological imperative as thematic metaphor is particularly resonant, though some emotional beats rely on stated concepts rather than immersive dramatization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates fresh fusion of myth-making, speculative biology, and historical reclamation. While containing some poetic flourishes, most imagery (sunlight as ancestral spotlight, chrysanthemum stains) serves narrative purpose without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements combine with deliberate surrealism, though the conceptual density occasionally strains plausibility. The fusion of performance-as-investigation and genetic imperative carries genuine thematic weight despite occasional narrative conceits.</comment>
