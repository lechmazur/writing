<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Poetic but under-developed: Iris' "late-blooming" trait manifests in her determined farming but lacks visceral transformation. Her obsession with cosmic balance drives the story's metaphysics but rarely translates into concrete character decisions. The spyglass-as-legacy-object trope feels familiar rather than uniquely revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented continuity: The plot oscillates between establishing Iris' farm, her cosmic quest, and brotherly mourning without clear progression. The ending's "comprehension" feels abruptly conjured rather than earned through prior action. Pacing balances poetic pauses with forward motion but risks becoming a vignette rather than a complete arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually overwhelming in the best way: Ash-thick air mingling with "chlorophyll and static" creates an ecosystem of decay and rebirth. Some image clusters (lightning as staircases, tears-as-gravity) verge on over-intellectualization, but the rooftop's tactile details (rusted spade, warped planters) ground the surrealism effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphor machine: The cosmic balance conceit delivers philosophical heft through electrified metaphors, particularly the "stair-light" tears. While undeniably beautiful, emotional engagement occasionally founders on abstract ruminations rather than character-anchored stakes. The conclusion offers thematic resolution without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Damaged but salvageable: Striking phrases ("gutters as seedbeds," "aurora ghosts") combat occasional over-flowering ("cucumbers holding the sky"). The voice avoids genre tropes through poetic abstraction but sometimes sacrifices emotional immediacy for linguistic excess, creating a distance between reader and hero.</comment>
