<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; Ruen's bashfulness feels present but lacks consistent demonstration through actions beyond physical gestures (hood adjusting, flinching). His duality as executioner vs. preserver works conceptually, but the emotional complexity of this conflict remains slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is purposeful with strong mirroring between yoga poses and forbidden dance, but the monarch's sudden acceptance strains plausibility. Pacing feels slightly rushed in conveying how guards unknowingly preserve the dance - more gradual integration into their movements would strengthen cause/effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through sensory details - lavender mats, turtle keychain weight, counterpoint of drums/waves - creating visceral immersion. The floating studio's vulnerability aligns perfectly with theme of ephemeral cultural preservation. No noticeable inconsistencies in sensory logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective emotional subtext through embodied symbolism (axe-head mask vs turtle charm) creates lingering resonance. While yoga-as-rebellion conceit is strong, the monarch's "smiling behind hood" conclusion feels slightly tidy - greater ambiguity in his realization could enhance thematic potency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging executioner's guilt with cultural preservation through yoga, avoiding genre tropes. Some phrases ("bashful executioner") border on oxymoronic clich√©, but the turtle keychain's symbolic function and dance-as-weapon concept demonstrate meaningful innovation within expected boundaries.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Extremely cohesive given high concept density; all elements serve multiple narrative functions (e.g. festival timeframe enables both monarch's suspicion and sensory richness). The brief length feels intentional, though thematic depth occasionally sacrifices full emotional payoff in favor of conceptual elegance.</comment>
