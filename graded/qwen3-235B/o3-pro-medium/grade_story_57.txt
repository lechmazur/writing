<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lord Peregrine’s duality as a meek aristocrat with latent resolve is clever but underexplored; his transformation feels too abrupt to fully satisfy character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward efficiently but relies on convenient mechanics (e.g., improvised tool use) that strain plausibility within tight pacing; the arc is resolved but uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet soil, echoes) evoke mood, but the secret workshop and aristocratic setting blend awkwardly; atmosphere lacks immersive cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., metaphor of “sharper than a compliment”) enrich themes of hidden agency and quiet rebellion, though emotional subtext remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dialogue (“terribly sorry”) and metaphors (“thunderbolt of empathy”) show style but occasional ornate phrasing distracts; character logic occasionally feels oversimplified.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Premise executes clever twists but leans on contrivances (emergency flush) and compressed scope; thematically unified but uneven in execution across elements.</comment>
