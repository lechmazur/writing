<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's curiosity is present but underexplored; motivation is implied rather than actively demonstrated; dialogue is sparse but evocative, though internal logic of his actions lacks emotional heft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through atmospheric clues rather than cause-and-effect, creating dreamlike continuity but sacrificing narrative urgency; abrupt ending feels thematically congruent but narratively underprepared.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially immersive; setting permeates every paragraph, with details like "inkblot maps" and "living mica" reinforcing both tone and conceptual framework.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and cosmic metaphors create lasting resonance; theme of preserving possibility through unfinished memory is poignant; some abstract imagery risks obscuring emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, specific metaphors avoid clich√©; minimal "tell" in favor of symbolic action; however, surrealism occasionally veers into ornate abstraction that strains narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements intertwine conceptually but not structurally; the ship graveyard and ring box feel essential while timeframe and tone have looser integration; leaves intellectual resonance more than emotional aftertaste.</comment>
