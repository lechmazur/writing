<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strengths: The frail guard's resolutely wavering nature and internal conflict feel authentic. Motivation to escape predetermination is consistent, with actions (using the phial, seeking the cave) logically flowing from his yearning. Weaknesses: Limited exploration of how his "frailty" shaped his past choices; more depth in backstory or secondary characters would strengthen.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strengths: Tight, urgent structure mirrors the tide's inevitability. Use of the phial to rewrite branding directly drives the plot. Cause-effect (e.g., tide timing consequences) is clear. Weaknesses: Some compressed moments (e.g., cave escape) could use more visceral tension to avoid feeling slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strengths: Tidal island setting permeates every aspect—relentless tides metaphorically mirror Etris' struggle against fate. Sensory details (salt mist, vinegar reek, groaning pines) create an immersive, melancholy-drenched world. Weakness: The "rebel meetings in grove" history feels underutilized for worldbuilding depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Metaphor-rich prose (ink "tricking light," "rib-damp stone") elevates theme of identity fluidity. Emotional impact comes through subtext (e.g., regret as "peeling paint"). Ending's "unbroken dawn" ties theme to imagery. Weakness: Some lines border on excessive lyricism ("mother's uncompromising yank") risk diluting emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strengths: Original use of non-Eurocentric rebellion motifs (skin-painted allegiances), unique alchemical properties. Avoids genre clichés by focusing on intimate metamorphosis rather than battles. Weaknesses: Occasional over-ornamentation ("caged sandpiper" risks sentimentality) and slightly predictable "escape at low tide" trope slightly marr originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strengths: Despite numerous constraints, all elements serve character arc or themes. The brevity accentuates existential urgency. Leaves lingering questions about identity's malleability. Weakness: Concept density occasionally strains word limit (grove messages' logistics, phial's mechanics could use subtler expansion).</comment>
