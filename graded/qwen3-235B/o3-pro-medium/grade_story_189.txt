<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters remain archetypal; "bright-eyed" enthusiasm dominates but lacks complexity. Motivations tied to plot mechanics rather than psychological depth. Sparse reactions to assigned attributes ("uniquely literal" only superficially impacts dialogue).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres to three-act structure within constraints. Overcharge action propels climax, but pacing stumbles slightly in exposition. Connections between elements (key, notes, generator) maintain coherence despite tight word count. Arc feels truncated but purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration: kelp-kerosene smell, green luminescence, phantom voltage create immersive decayed world. Timeframe ("post-water-war") contextualizes desperation. Setting actively shapes plot through hidden power sources and haunted history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "lungs of cosmos" and militarized debt themes add resonance. Writing style amplifies mood ("tiles screamed starlight"). Conflict between immediate consequences and grand ambitions drives emotional tension. Ending balances sacrifice with lingering hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distrusts clich√©s through cyberpunk-inflected ghost logic. Some phrases verge on ornate but serve mood ("algae ribbons"). Motivations avoid sentimentality; emotional subtext emerges through actions rather than direct statements. Unique synthesis of hard sci-fi and decaying infrastructure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative organically (star maps drive both plot and theme). Concise format feels intentional, leaving questions about cosmic debt. Technical jargon anchors speculative ideas while maintaining lyrical tone. Brevity challenges thematic saturation but establishes strong conceptual hook.</comment>
