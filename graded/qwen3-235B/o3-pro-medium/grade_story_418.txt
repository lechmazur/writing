<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich yet emotionally flat; actions align with tenuously certain motivation but lack nuance in depicting the sister's absence's psychological impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ritual framework provides structure but feels rushed; central conflict (self-avengy) resolves too conveniently without dramatic stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Radiation-poisoned beauty is visceral and memorable; sensory details like metallic wind and glowing bark elevate the decay-as-metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose sings, but overt statements ('merry bitterness') undercut subtext; confession climax lands emotionally despite schematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unique image combinations (e.g., colored apples as 'radioactive irresistible') transcend purple prose, but confession scene leans on expected catharsis beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Impressive thematic cohesion undermined by formulaic emotional beats; the sister's absence could have been woven more organically into the wasteland's logic.</comment>
