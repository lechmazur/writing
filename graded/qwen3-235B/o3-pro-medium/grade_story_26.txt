<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Lack of emotional depth; motivations feel abstract rather than earned. The character’s actions display determination but lack personal stakes or transformative arcs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fragmented momentum; while the bell’s activation creates tension, the abrupt introduction of drones feels unearned. The plot relies on poetic abstraction at the expense of structural clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stunning sensory worldbuilding; chromatic verbs (“pulsed,” “glowed”) and cyberpunk juxtapositions (bioluminescent flora, rusted tech) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</comment><comment>Rich metaphoric layers (DNA as salvation code, shame as a prison) and lyrical prose elevate the narrative, though occasional overreliance on syntactic complexity muffles emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with its genetic-recoding conceit, but occasionally lapses into ornate abstractions (“chlorophyll scripture”) that risk obscuring narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic fusion of technology and empathy, but inconsistent balance between poetic density and narrative accessibility weakens immediate impact.</comment>
