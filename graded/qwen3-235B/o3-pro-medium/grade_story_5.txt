<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but lacks interiority; motivations inferred through actions more than emotional conviction. The "guarded" trait manifests logically but doesn't evolve, leaving nuance unexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic structure with satisfying circularity (beginning/end motion of rocking chair). Pacing drags slightly during turbine descriptions, but cause/effect between amulet, nightmare, and antidote maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and singularâ€”power plant decay merges hauntingly with oceanic folklore. Sensory collisions (copper groans + gull chuckles) crystallize a mythic-industrial liminality that transcends gimmickry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors ("hum of humility", "turbines tutoring seashells") elevate the theme of generational knowledge. Ending delivers quiet catharsis without sentimentality. Some "show-don't-tell" lapses in internal monologue phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes by hybridizing folklore with decaying tech, but occasional phrases ("drowned histories") border on lyrical shortcuts. Emotional resonance emerges via atmosphere more than character specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function interdependently (amulet informs nightmares, power plant enables ritual), though the rocking chair's symbolic role feels peripheral. Originality outweighs length constraints; theme of preservation-as-activism lingers.</comment>
