<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization leans heavily on mythic archetypes but lacks nuanced interiority; motivations are coherent but primarily plot-driven rather than psychologically complex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through mystic-scientific synthesis, though the ritual's emotional payoff is compressed. Resolution feels inevitable but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere balances eerie naturalism and hallucinatory dread. Sensory details (ozoned cedar, warming stitches) create visceral immersion without overindulgence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering of chemical processes and cosmic justice creates haunting subtext. The final image of "gravity believing him" crystallizes themes with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptual fusion of quantum mysticism and familial haunting, though some similes ("compasses fluttering like trapped bees") risk cloyingness in close proximity to fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a mythic mechanism that feels inevitable rather than constructed. The brevity amplifies tension rather than diluting it, leaving philosophical residue.</comment>
