<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's tension and motivation to escape control are consistent; physical descriptions and symbolic actions reinforce internal conflict, though emotional arc remains compressed by brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from provocation (security charter) to rebellion, but pivotal moments (e.g. collecting fragments) feel abbreviated within the word limit, slightly undermining narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative lunar atmosphere through tactile sensory details (glowing plants, silver dust) creates immersive tension between oppression and liberation, though some setting elements merit deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("chlorophyll prayers") and layered themes of autonomy elevate the prose; ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact could be more visceral through character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clich√©s through lyrical phrasing and conceptual juxtapositions (e.g. "serene anger"), with rare lapses into ornate description that slightly dilute immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically resonant whole, but the story's brevity prevents full realization of character depth and thematic complexity needed for top-tier publication.</comment>
