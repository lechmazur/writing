<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Calder's amiable gambler persona is vividly rendered through subtle actions (smiling, card-shuffling), but his "peaceful anger" and kingdom-restoration motive remain abstract, occasionally undercutting emotional resonance. The ledger bet reveals his curiosity but not deeper psychological layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot's progression from mysterious ledger acquisition to revolutionary schematics maintains logical cause-effect chains. However, the charity drives' dual purpose feels slightly under-explained, and the firefly-breeding gambit resolution emerges abruptly despite solid setup for most arcs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marsh fireflies create striking visual poetry, and the ledger's hydrolysis metaphor ties to environmental dissolution imagery. However, the charity drives' connection to the swamp setting lacks thematic anchoring, and sensory details occasionally prioritizing lyricism over place-making.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The subtextual equating of card games with societal deconstruction demonstrates intellectual ambition. The petal-fall methodology creates haunting procedural resonance, while the "counting fireflies" denouement crystallizes character transformation. Only occasional over-reliance on technical jargon weakens emotional access points.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in hydrolysis-as-revolution and fireflies-as-conspirators concepts. "Peaceful anger" avoids easy clich√©s, and the ledger's floral formulae feel fresh. Some phrases ("lake reflecting stormcloud") border on overused nature metaphors, but risks taken with structural and conceptual synthesis impress.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story's economy in weaving rebellion mechanics with character psychology showcases editorial discipline. The gamble-as-revolution framework justifies compression, though Priya's role and the firefly logistics require slight reader investment beyond the text's immediate scope to fully cohere.</comment>
