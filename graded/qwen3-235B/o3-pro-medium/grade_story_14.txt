<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters possess surface quirks (naive gambler, eccentric engineer) but lack psychological depth; motivations feel poetic yet underexplored; Ronan’s arc ends ambiguously without full emotional payoff</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows an elliptical logic with poetic momentum but struggles under the weight of thematic density; climax feels earned yet structurally rushed; coherence maintained through atmosphere rather than tight plotting</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and original – decaying infrastructure paired with scientific detritus creates hauntingly tactile worldbuilding; sensory details (soot-streaked laughter, phosphorescent sparks) immerse through specificity</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Language is richly metaphorical (“turbines roaring like newborn constellations”) with cohesive theme of impermanence versus legacy; ending transcends plot through emotional resonance even when mechanics strain</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Style avoids cliché but flirts with hyperbole (“laughter as sparks before oblivion”); emotional subtext implied through gesture rather than exposition; fresh use of scientific decay as metaphor</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements feel both integral (turbines, candle=barter) and arbitrarily chosen (professor’s equations); concept density strains cohesion but rewards poetic interpretation; lingers in the mind as fragmented elegy</comment>
