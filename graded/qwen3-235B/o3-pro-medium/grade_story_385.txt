<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's "pleasant meddler" persona is hinted through actions, but lacks psychological depth; motivations for decoding symbols are poetic but underdeveloped; reactions to objects feel more symbolic than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows via symbolic logic rather than causality; surreal transformations (hospital to shore) strain coherence but align with tone; resolution feels thematically satisfying despite compressed arc; cause-effect edges blur in ways that feel intentional yet occasionally disorienting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through vivid contradictions (sterile ward vs. briny air); sensory details like flaking rust and glowing footprints immerse without overpowering; setting-object connections (skates as archival relics) work conceptually but strain realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (skates as migratory seeds, corridors as coastlines) create thematic resonance; ending lingers as mythic gesture; conflict (unlocking knowledge) resolved in ways that privilege theme over character; subtext about communal memory makes ending feel weighty despite abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh, unexpected metaphors avoid clich√©s; flowery segments (e.g., "lucid confusion...sunless greenhouse") serve purposeful style rather than ornamentation; transitions between realism/surrealism could feel jarring but pass as intentional; emotional resonance emerges through atmospheric accumulation rather than explicit cues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Blends assigned elements into cohesive, thought-provoking whole; details serve poetic cohesion over realism; brevity enhances the mythic quality; lingers as cryptic parable rather than conventional narrative.</comment>
