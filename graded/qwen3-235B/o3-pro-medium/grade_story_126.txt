<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is conceptually compelling but lacks interiorityâ€”motivation feels assigned instead of earned, with aloof passion telegraphed rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Limited by brevity, the ascent provides momentum but some transitions (e.g., climbing poster-to-maintenance-shaft feels contrived) undermine structural cohesion</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually cohesive decay: charcoal Earth, ozone smells, flickering ads create hauntingly beautiful ruin; tone marries post-apocalyptic desolation with elegiac resignation</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (static sparks as rebellion, churn-turned-engine) and paradoxical emotions (aloof passion) linger; subtext about ecological capitalist collapse resonates</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Only minor purple prose moments (-powdered regrets-); metaphors feel freshly minted (-mutinous fireflies-, -hollow promenade-) avoid AI-like pattern repetition</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>ELEMENTS WORK TOGETHER BUT BRIEFNESS HINDERS FULL MATURATION; BOLD THEMATIC CHOICES (commerce/grief/rupture) suggest potential for expanded literary excellence</comment>
