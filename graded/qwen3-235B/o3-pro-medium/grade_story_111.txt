<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivations (faith crisis, desire to "wrestle dreams") are evocative but thinly dramatized through action; Fariel's alchemical background shapes his tools but not consistently his logic or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dense metaphorical action drives the plot but creates structural dissonance; the resurrection climax feels sudden and unearned within the compressed arc despite lyrical build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is viscerally constructed through alchemical decay (chlorine/fur scents), dog skeletons, and subway-lit mist; however, the "secret dog park" concept strains credulity despite rich textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("exultant grief," "feral act of standing") and imagery of vapor-as-faith resonate; the ending's transcendence earns emotional weight through sensory specificity rather than abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ribbon's "intuitive" properties and "feral faith" offer innovation, but over-reliance on adjectival density ("celestial braille," "emerald vapor") occasionally veers into self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as compressed lyric allegory, but some assigned elements (dogs' resurrection mechanics) feel conceptually patchworked rather than organically fused with the central metaphor.</comment>
