<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetic but underexplored; Lira's transformation feels abrupt rather than earned, and Patch remains more symbol than substance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc of discovery, though the resolution feels slightly perfunctory—puzzle assembly as metaphor gains clarity but lacks narrative consequence beyond atmospheric payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's triumph: the acid rain forest's texture, decay, and fleeting greenness create a haunting, immersive world that deepens the thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (moonlit fragments as seeds of renewal), subtext-rich imagery, and lyrical prose that elevates the apocalypse into something mythic and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rarely clichéd; metaphors like 'corroded signage read like thunder' feel fresh. However, some phrasings ('prickly wonder') risk aesthetic detachment rather than earned emotional heft.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful, though the story leans heavily on poetic abstraction over concrete stakes. The brief form amplifies mystery but risks losing visceral engagement.</comment>
