<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's meekness and motivation via heartbreak are clear but underdeveloped; actions align with traits yet lack emotional depth; symbolic transformation feels abrupt without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through bureaucratic duty to pyre-induced awakening, but cause-effect logic hinges on vague metaphysics; coherent arc within word limit but pacing lacks precision in exposition's middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Underwater imagery creates eerie, decaying atmosphere with salt-smoke and rust-plankton details, but setting's political implications remain underexploited; connection to bureaucratic ritual feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as unfulfilled desire, dictionaries as urban blueprints) create haunting subtext; ending's symbolic sacrifice works, but heavier 'tell' sections dilute emotional immediacy – ash-as-seafloor-snow is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original concept inverted – regret as energy source – avoids genre tropes; some overwritten phrases ("luminous regret") border on self-parody, but the fusion of mythic and bureaucratic tones suggests human artistry.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically (dictionaries → fuel → revelation) with thematic cohesion; brevity feels stylized, though the abstract ending risks vagueness – leaves intellectual residue more than emotional.</comment>
