<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marin’s profession as a welder informs his tactile relationship with the button box but fails to explore deeper psychological implications of his work or trauma. His “patiently impatient” trait is surface-level, not fully driving decisions or revealing layered motives beyond basic plot functions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot momentum hinges on pressing buttons to merge timelines, but cause/effect logic feels abstracted—transformation lacks physical stakes. Narrative arc is complete but constrained by reliance on visual set pieces over compelling emotional/spatial progression within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually and sensorily immersive—the ozone-and-brine welder, wheezing speakers, and violet dawn create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere. However, tactile textures outweigh emotional depth, leaving world-building slightly adrift of thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness (e.g., timelines as welding cables, power as “warm salt”) elevates impact, while the ambiguous ending lingers. Subtext about erasure and choice resonates, though some effects prioritize style over earned emotional heft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“subaquatic hums,” “dance floor disassembly”) avoid clichés, but self-consciously poetic descriptions occasionally border on excess. Story feels human-crafted but balances ornate prose with moments of haunting clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a singular vision but lean on the setting’s novelty to compensate for underdeveloped emotional stakes. The premise’s ambition and lingering final image justify the format, though depth feels abbreviated.</comment>
