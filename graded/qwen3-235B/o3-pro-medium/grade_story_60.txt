<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arin's indifference shapes his actions but lacks depth; motivations remain opaque despite assigned traits. Reactions to relics hint at internal conflict but do so obliquely, with no distinct voice to anchor his perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot driven by relic collection and forging ritual, but transitions between tasks feel mechanical. Resolution emerges abruptly; cause-and-effect relies heavily on mystical hand-waving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (soot, trembling candlelight) dominate, but the "uniquely natural" trait is superficially applied. Atmosphere supports tone but falters in connecting to the character's worldview.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral imagery (ribbon "hovering between dawn and dust") elevates the mythic undertones. Ending's metaphorical resonance outshines underdeveloped themes of rebirth, leaving a lingering, enigmatic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but indulges in ornate descriptors ("patient ivy"). Emotional beats rely on atmospheric immersion rather than explicit statement, though some metaphors flirt with overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, but the brevity strains complexity. The cathedral's bones and relic logic suggest depth, though the narrative engine feels slightly algorithmic in its symbolic precision.</comment>
