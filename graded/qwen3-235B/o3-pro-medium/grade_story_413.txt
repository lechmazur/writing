<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits like 'listless noble' and 'naively sophisticated' shape Hadrian's passive curiosity but lack psychological depth; his motivations and actions remain abstract, prioritizing symbolism over human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Non-linear progression follows dream logic; the surreal plot coheres thematically but lacks urgency or stakes, creating a fragmented sense of structure within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisitely wrought atmosphere merges the haunted plain, sentient corn, and pre-cognitive shadows; every sensory detail reinforces the tone of archaic mystery and existential rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radiant metaphors ('maize spirits tremble'), layered subtext (intention vs. lineage), and cyclical causality create intellectual/emotional resonance; ending feels earned and hauntingly ambiguous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inventive language occasionally crosses into precious over-ornamentation; some phrases ('naively sophisticated') risk affectation, while the abstract framework avoids clich√©s through poetic reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Elements cohere into a unified mythopoetic parable; the story transcends its constraints to deliver profound thematic weight, though its marketability depends on tolerance for avant-garde abstraction.</grade>
