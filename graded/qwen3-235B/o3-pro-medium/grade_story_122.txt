<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation to shatter the "mirage of safety" is clear, but depth and human nuance are lacking; actions align with traits but feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively from codex opening to closing, with the lightning-reflection climax driving momentum, though the abstract cause/effect relationships and circular structure occasionally strain coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Highly immersive setting via vivid, tech-mystical hybrids (bronze vultures, silicon plateau), but sensory details beyond visuals (touch/smell) are sparse, slightly limiting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors and lyrical prose elevate storytelling; themes of safety as fear and recursive reality resonate deeply, though emotional impact leans cerebral over visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original blend of cyberpunk theology and metaphysical conflict avoids clich√©s; language is purposeful with fresh imagery, though occasional ornate phrasing risks bordering on stylistic indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong cohesion with all elements contributing, but brevity leaves some thematic and character layers underexplored; style mostly elevates the narrative, though abstract sections disrupt clarity.</comment>
