<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and tied to actions, but some depth is lost in the short form; the protagonist's internal conflict is well-established, but secondary characters lack development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure is tight and cohesive, using the word limit effectively. Pacing remains controlled, though the ending feels slightly rushed despite strong thematic connections between beginning and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and metaphors (hourglass, sand, chalk lines) create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere. The integration of time and guilt into the setting enhances both mood and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism and subtext elevates the narrative. Emotional impact is achieved through layered storytelling, with the final image of light redrawing chalk lines as a nuanced resolution to the central conflict of time and guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls with fresh imagery (hourglass marketplace, confession through karaoke). Some phrasing ("remorse peeled as fruit") edges toward poetic predictability, but the core concept remains inventive and humanized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are interwoven with purpose, though some (Mira's 'tastefully offensive' trait) feel less essential. The concise format amplifies tension rather than restricting it, leaving a lingering resonance about redemption and time.</comment>
