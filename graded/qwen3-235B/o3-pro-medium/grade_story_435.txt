<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's voice remains distinct, but motivations lack depth. Actions propel plot more than internal logic; persona adoption feels more thematic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints, though some cause-effect transitions (e.g., instantaneous ghost confrontation) feel underdeveloped. Resolution ties neatly but some leaps in logic exist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, oppressive atmosphere built through tactile details (vapor, flour, stone dust). Sensory immersion strongly supports both theme and tension, creating a physical manifestation of systemic control.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (dream calcification as institutional oppression) resonate powerfully. The ending's "leaven" metaphor expertly ties cyclical labor to revolutionary potential, making abstract themes visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through inventive imagery (stone dust halos, gratitude as leaven), but occasional phrasing ("peculiar faith") risks ornamental abstraction over emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Integration of elements feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The compressed form works as a thematic device, leaving lingering questions about institutional transformation's permanence.</comment>
