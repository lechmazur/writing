<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters display consistent traits (Arista's "reckless faith," narrator's skepticism) and their dynamic drives key moments, but motivations (especially Arista's) lack psychological depth. Limited emotional evolution despite the transcendent climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot advances cohesively through Arista's experiment, with the lens/meteor as linchpins, but the word limit compresses cause-effect transitions. The resolution feels conceptually complete yet emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory pairing of ozone/summer heat and liminal "between innings" silence grounds the cosmic elements. However, the ballpark-tracking station juxtaposition occasionally feels symbolic rather than intrinsically atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("rebellious scriptures of light") and cosmic-scoreboard imagery create resonance, but the theme of wonder vs. cynicism remains somewhat abstract. Ending prioritizes mood over meaningful character transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through alchemy/tech fusion, but contains isolated purple prose ("fresh ink of wonder"). Arista's logic occasionally feels overly idealized rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interconnect effectively (projector/refracted sigils/lens) though some forced flourishes. The brevity enhances mystique but restricts thematic payoff. Lingering impact lies in imagery more than narrative depth.</comment>
