<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Caras's dual motives (assigned contract vs. personal vow) are clear but her internal conflict lacks sufficient nuance. The assassin's abrupt shift from killer to image-shatterer feels underdeveloped, though her lingering doubt and palms-up ending create faint emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot achieves a tight arc: setup (observing Rhun), tension (moral dilemma), release (transformation of image into collective action). Pacing struggles with explaining how Rhun "bleeds doubt" rather than blood, but the structure remains intact despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Each sensory detail (tinkling laughter, kaleidoscopic shards, glass blankets) builds a vivid world where oppressive bureaucracy clashes with fragile hope. The baroque asteroid's aesthetic of ornate decay mirrors the thematic tension between tyranny and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "blood blossoming" or "stained glass shattered" resonate subtextually. The ending achieves poetic ironyâ€”Caras transmutes violence into collective catharsis. The lens' role as both tool and symbolic rupture elevates the storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prose avoids formulaic writing despite occasional density ("ornate scripture carved solely to dazzle idle tourists"). Similes (laughter as music-box cruelty) feel fresh, and subtextual political critique of "sunrise tariffs" adds humanistic tension rather than mechanical plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements creates a lasting meditation on revolutionary action. Every detail (even the bus schedule) serves a narrative purpose. The abrupt lens-shattering ending feels purposefully unresolved, inviting deeper reflection on liberation tactics.</comment>
