<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While Marrow's vendetta and artistic precision are clearly established, her emotional transition from scorn to reluctant forgiveness feels expedited, relying on a single locket revelation rather than layered character reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot’s cause-and-effect chain (photos → trail → confrontation → twist) is logically sound, but the tight word limit sacrifices deeper stakes in the rebellion’s mechanics and the Regent’s psychological unraveling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The candy-scented rebellion and charred market are evocative, but the setting’s potential for societal context (e.g., how candy sculptures function in this world) remains underexplored, diluting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The contrast between sugar’s fragility and political violence is potent, and the theme of inherited kindness amid vengeance resonates. However, the ending’s emotional payoff leans on exposition rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (“glassy serpents”) and the locket’s dual revelation avoid overt clichés. However, phrases like “tears steamed off the sugar floor” border on melodrama, slightly undercutting authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story weaves its required elements into a thematically resonant arc, but the hidden continent’s abrupt resolution and the Regent’s sudden guilt lack the layered complexity needed to feel fully earned in this scope.</comment>
