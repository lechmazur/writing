<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; Yara's shift from scientist to collaborator feels underdeveloped. Assigned traits (wildness, protest history) shape actions but lack nuanced exploration. Dialogue lacks distinct voices, though the tattered flag effectively reveals shared history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quarantine drives initial plot but paddleboarding hobby feels contrived. Sculpture creation forms a coherent arc, but pacing falters in middle. Concept of freedom's cost influences resolution but isn't fully dramatized through character choices. Abrupt transitions between technical details and poetic imagery weaken coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alpine ozone station's sterile atmosphere contrasts with themes of rebellion. Vivid sensory details (ozone tang, UV-glittering disinfectant) immerse readers, but setting's environmental significance isn't fully leveraged for thematic resonance. Timeframe's urgency (child's first school day) adds tension but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (sculpture as "anatomy of atmospheric readings") evoke emotional resonance. Subtext about art/science synergy is thought-provoking, but some "showing" opportunities missed (e.g., fear of administrative backlash could be embodied more). Ending's symbolism is striking but slightly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains mechanical phrasing ("whispering apologies to tranquil instruments"). Stand-up paddleboarding feels algorithmically inserted rather than organically developed. Sensory details are specific but occasionally overwritten ("sky bruised yet unbeaten"). Emotional stakes are conceptually strong but psychologically thin.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently incorporated but unevenly prioritized. Paddleboarding undermines authenticity. Ozone station and flag drive theme while quarantine enables character connection. Overreliance on poetic abstraction sometimes obscures narrative urgency. Lingering questions about institutional repression versus personal legacy suggest depth but remain underexplored.</comment>
