<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (mending collective memory) is clear but underexplored; the "hesitant bard" trait drives actions but lacks psychological complexity; the plush's symbolic role as unjudging audience is effective but underexplained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Solid three-act structure within word limit; dream-hopping mechanics are fantastical but logically consistent; cause/effect between Orrin's actions and tapestry repair feels slightly rushed; abrupt time-unraveling ending undermines full emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (xenon static, dream-vapor auroras) immerse readers, but setting remains abstract; "abandoned amphitheater" and "liquid aurora" create atmospheric coherence but could deepen symbolic connections to fragility theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Packs emotional resonance through paradoxical concepts (shyness as strength, destruction through healing); metaphors (tapestry, dinosaur dust) resonate thematically; ending's bittersweet trade-off between city's healing and Orrin's erasure is poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through unique combinations (ironic awe + fragile time) and avoids purple prose; some phrases ("motivated the slumbering city") border on formulaic, but overall maintains stylistic originality through inventive similes ("fluff like relics of vanished roars").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent and conceptually ambitious within constraints; elements serve theme but occasionally feel checklist-derived; brief length heightens poetic impact but strains character development; ending prompts thematic reflection but lacks narrative closure.</comment>
