<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character motivation (to consecrate a vow through mending, not violence) is consistent, with detachment shaping decisions. Voice has lyrical clarity but lacks visceral vulnerability behind the vow's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot uses time-sensitive mural completion to create urgency. Causality (collage altering reality) is logically integrated. Pacing feels slightly rushed during the collage's transformation but maintains structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting merges industrial and ephemeral elements (neon decay, holographic motifs) masterfully. Sensory alchemy between polymer bales and UV light builds haunting beauty. Atmospheric consistency falters only during alarm's abrupt dismissal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Symbolism of pottery shard as fractured legacy and mural's transformation as redemption creates emotional resonance. Central conflict (mending vs. violence) is thematically cohesive. Ending achieves quiet profundity through contrast between swords and open palms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in collage-as-timeline-editing. Some overwritten phrasing ("whispering motors") and conceptual similarities to shadow puppet myths slightly undermine freshness. Emotional beats are shown more than stated but occasionally over-aestheticized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive through interconnected themes of reconstruction. The short format feels intentional. Lingers through paradoxical beauty of brokenness becoming sacred text. Combines assigned elements organically without checklist feel.</comment>
