<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight integration of motivation through trauma, but emotional resonance lacks subtext depth. Actions align with irate smuggler trait but backstory feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean trajectory from tea-leaf revelation to escape decision. Minor pacing hiccups with monksâ€™ cloth introduction. Logical throughline maintained despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually rich environment with tactile decay details (rusted railings, fogged drones). Atmosphere amplifies melancholy and desperation without feeling derivative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphor system (tea leaves as prophecy, tears activating maps). Ending achieves symbolic resonance. Slight over-reliance on poetically heightened language risks emotional muddiness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids machine-generated banality with inventive connections (oolong monks, tannin constellations). Some adverb-heavy phrases ("biting sincerity") dilute otherwise lean prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically rather than as checklist. Brief length weaponizes poetic compression. Lingering questions about waterfall destination deepen narrative intrigue.</comment>
