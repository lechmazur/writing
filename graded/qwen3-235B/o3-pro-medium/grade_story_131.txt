<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is consistent but underexplored; his orphan background informs his adaptability but lacks emotional depth. The courage transformation feels schematic rather than organic, though the detached observational voice is distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plot uses all elements cohesively, with the cryptic message directly triggering action. Pacing feels compressed but functional; gravitational anomaly's sudden resolution maintains thematic resonance despite its brevity. Timeframe constraint is cleverly transformed into a character calibration arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges mundane garage details (dust, oil stains) with surreal gravitational distortion. Sensory elements like the hum and warm stones create visceral immersion. The detached tone perfectly mirrors the character's emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of gravity as emotional/cognitive metaphor is profound. The ending's thematic clarity ('fear as echo') provides lasting impact. Subtext about institutional mottos versus self-construction of courage adds depth. Writing style balances lyrical precision with narrative economy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strongly avoids formulaic writing with gravitational anomaly concept and tactile metaphors. Some phrases like "dawn-colored sky" border on abstraction, but emotional nuance through action (bolting mechanism as courage calibration) feels authentically human. Tension between detachment and engagement feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fantastical elements (gravity, floating objects) coexist seamlessly with domestic setting. The story uses its constraints inventively rather than feeling constrained. Epigrammatic ending lingers in the mind as thematic synthesis rather than moralizing. Brief form becomes asset through concentrated imagery.</comment>
