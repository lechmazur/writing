<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rowan's "carefully careless" persona is intriguing but underexplored; his sudden willingness to sacrifice blood feels unearned despite his stated motivation. Lenora remains enigmatic but lacks psychological depth beyond gothic archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The plot accelerates from blood drive to blood sacrifice with poetic urgency, but transitions feel rushed (e.g., immediate shift from blood drive to mansion at dusk). The compact arc resolves logically but lacks emotional gravity due to thin character foundations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details like inverted candlelight, phantom chandelier vibrations, and iron scent create an oppressive yet intoxicating atmosphere. The mansion's sentience emerges organically through environmental storytelling rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikes a rare balance of mythic symbolism and precise imagery ("thornless black rose") with structural elegance. The central metaphor—control through deliberate relinquishment—echoes in every interaction, elevated by taut, lyrical prose that avoids overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While some phrases flirt with gothic cliché ("midnights unrecorded"), the blood-feeding botanicals and silent communication subvert expectations. The narrative flow avoids algorithmic patterns but occasionally sacrifices character logic for poetic rhythm.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting metaphor for complicity in transactions of power and sacrifice. The concise format serves the theme, though the ending's mystical resolution risks undercutting the intriguing ambiguity established earlier.</comment>
