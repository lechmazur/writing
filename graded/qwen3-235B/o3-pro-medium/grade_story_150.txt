<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Jericho's traits are vividly conveyed through poetic actions and symbolic objects, but secondary character Vega serves as a plot device rather than a fully realized figure. Ambivalence about solitude/harmony resonates, yet motivations remain abstract due to the brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strong central arc from misalignment to convergence, but pacing feels rushed. The eclipse as climax works, yet Vega's entrance lacks buildup, weakening the emotional payoff within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (bottled auroras, clattering dice) create immersive steampunk-Noir fusion. The observatory’s mechanical flaws mirror cosmic chaos, while phosphorescent coffee shop walls amplify surreal tension between fate and free will.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery (“double helix voices,” “molten light through dice”) elevates themes of collaboration vs. chaos. However, “saturated ambivalence” as stated emotion undercuts subtler symbolic work, leaning on abstract phrases over character-driven nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</comment>Unique fusion of outlaw lore, time mechanics, and cosmic mysticism avoids genre traps. Some phrases (“copper ribs,” “brick walls scribbling”) verge on ornate, but the runic dice’s recursive chaos and eclipse as narrative spine feel inventively executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherence amid high-concept density impresses. Story resists formula through poetic prose and paradoxical themes, though occasional abstraction (e.g., “virtuoso time-luthier”) prioritizes style over clarity, slightly undercutting publishability.</comment>
