<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characterization is lyrical but underdeveloped; motivations around nonviolence and chaos lack psychological depth. The assigned attribute "anxiously relaxed" is present but not meaningfully explored, and the "solitary birdwatcher" identity doesn't fully inform Bram's actions beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has structural symmetry but relies on abstract cosmic devices rather than organic conflict. The kilter action drives the climax effectively, though the cosmic blink framing creates artificial pacing. Connection between beginning/end feels conceptually coherent but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly imagined with "flickering fluorescent tubes" and "soaked meadow," but sensory details skew overly abstract (e.g., "bitterness braided through quiet like brambles"). The leaf classification office setting blends mundanity and surrealism well.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional lyrical precision and subtext about institutionalized order vs. organic chaos. Metaphors like "ventilation ducts spiraling leaves" create lasting imagery. However, the ending's resolution feels mannered rather than earned, reducing emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through bold conceptual fusion (birdwatching/leaf filing, cosmic rebellion via porcelain mask). Avoids clich√©s while maintaining stylistic consistency. Some lines border on ornate abstraction ("ceilings clock hesitate like a frightened finch") but generally serve the surrealist tone without descending into formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive around core themes but leans too heavily on poetic abstraction at the expense of emotional immediacy. The tight word count sacrifices character interiority. Leaves lingering questions about institutional critique, but the symbolic weight occasionally overwhelms narrative momentum.</comment>
