<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's traits (loneliness, ancestral wisdom) influence actions but remain under-explored; motivation (guarding relic) is clear but lacks psychological depth or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight ghost story arc with rising/falling action, but pacing feels compressed in critical moments; reversal of the Collector lacks emotional payoff despite clever execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory details ("musk of coffee, ozone") and tone ("playful dread"), yet the ghost booth's connection to broader worldbuilding remains sketchy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and inventive metaphors ("flame a rebellious dancer") elevate the story; ending feels cyclical rather than resonant, slightly diluting thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal elements (shifting napkin sigils, flame-guided combat) but wavers with overused motifs (ancestral relics, spectral callers); avoids generic by slanting familiar tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist without friction but lack integration into deeper thematic unity; storyâ€™s brevity enhances mystery yet leaves some concepts (ancestral duty, loneliness) undernourished.</comment>
