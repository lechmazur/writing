<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually consistent but underdeveloped: the swordsman's grace manifests through dance-like movement, but emotional/psychological complexity remains submerged beneath surreal imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually cohesive but structurally uneven: the telescope's transformation triggers a surreal exit, but the chamber's sudden appearance lacks narrative grounding in the established logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegantly realized setting with tactile details (coral statuary, emerald static) but strained biological plausibility (singing birds in submerged domes) weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Iridescent metaphors ("sword morphed into radiant script") elevate the prose, but emotional engagement remains secondary to aesthetic spectacle. Subtext about conformity carries weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by familiar rebellion tropes: the "individuality suppressed" worldbuilding leans on vague authoritarian clich√©s without deeper philosophical interrogation of collective vs. personal identity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive stylistic unity despite eclectic elements, though the underwater-to-cosmic shift risks conceptual whiplash. Theme of communication through detritus is compellingly executed.</comment>
