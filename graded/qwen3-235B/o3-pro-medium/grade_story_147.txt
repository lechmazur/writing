<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Persistent naivety drives decisions, but inner conflict and depth lack; motivations are consistent but underexplored psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc, but reliance on abstract causality (melodies as map keys) strains coherence; momentum fizzles in overcompressed ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere with precise sensory details; setting and tone coalesce into oppressive liminality that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (wind chimes as maps, rust/gold duality) dazzle, but thematic weight occasionally crushes narrative momentum; ending resonates but feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambition and atmospheric originality shine, but overreliance on lyrical abstraction borders on pretension; emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements bind tightly to theme and tone, though some (e.g., wind chime method) feel conceptually porous; brevity sacrifices deeper thematic payoff.</comment>
