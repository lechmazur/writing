<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character has a distinct role but lacks emotional complexity; motivation framed as abstract idealism feels underexplored despite narrative momentum and symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear progression and resolution, but some plot mechanics (e.g., sudden star-filled aperture) strain narrative logic despite compelling momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with tactile details (mirror shards, hissing leaves), though the impossible starlight exit slightly undermines immersion in the constructed world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic use of metaphor (burn patterns as guidance, chrysalis shards as currency) and resonant ending elevate thematic depth, though first-person voice occasionally veers toward over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subverts cryptid tropes with ecological redemption slant; avoids predictable phrasing except brief lapses into ornate descriptors ("mosaic constellations").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Balances surreal premise with emotional resonance; elements serve symbolic and narrative functions cohesively despite slight tonal imbalance in closing whimsy.</comment>
