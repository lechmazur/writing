<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Awarded for consistent hesitation shaping decisions, but lacks deeper psychological complexity. The voice and traits align, but motivations remain superficially tied to surface plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective plot engine within word count, but resolution feels rushed. The connection between evidence filing and portal activation lacks emotional and causal weight despite clever timing mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory fusion of steampunk and myth. Every environmental detail reinforces theme through contrasts (technology/tradition, warmth/cold), though occasionally overwrites at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (abandoned swords as relinquished identity, crab-shell exchanges mirroring systemic decay) creates intellectual resonance. The ending's sacrificial logic provides thematic closure while preserving poetic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original conceptual combinations (bureaucratic magic, crustacean divination) elevate above tropes, but some phrasing ("quivering resolve," "whispered myth") echoes formulaic fantasy cadences without fresh linguistic subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements form an interdependent narrative machine: the postcard's revelation depends on setting-specific rituals, the protagonist's reluctance determines pacing. Creates existential tension between systems and individual agency that lingers post-reading.</comment>
