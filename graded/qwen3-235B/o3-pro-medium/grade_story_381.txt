<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations (mapping cave systems as charting "resolve") are conceptually rich but lack emotional depth—no internal conflict or nuance in how "resolve" connects to brother's memory. Actions align with traits but feel static, more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently from exploration to revelation, but transitions through the borehole and the sudden "subterranean theater" feel compressed. The connection between mapping and the final catharsis is logical but under-earned, muddying the arc's emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually and sonically immersive; crystalline resonance, necromantic static, and cinematic metaphors create a haunting, layered atmosphere. Every detail reinforces the tension between memory and existence, though some descriptions (e.g., "icy certainty") veer toward overabstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., "closing credits as heartbeat and hope") and layered themes of memory as cartography elevate the story. The ending resonates emotionally, but some ideas (e.g., "resolve vs. despair") are stated more than dramatized, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending necromancy with cinematic nostalgia, but risks overwrought lyricism ("cracked celluloid prisms"). Avoids clichés but occasionally prioritizes density over clarity—e.g., "phantoms in widescreen shadows"—while emotional nuance feels implied rather than lived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive, with each element tied to memory's interplay with resolve. Some assigned elements (e.g., "between sets") are loosely integrated, but the fusion of necromantic cartography and personal loss feels distinct and intentional within the constraints.</comment>
