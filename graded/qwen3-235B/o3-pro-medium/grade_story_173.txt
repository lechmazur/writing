<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level despite poetic language. The assigned attribute of trustworthiness shapes actions but lacks tangible consequences for failure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels slightly compressed. The action of reclaiming scrolls drives the narrative, though the multiverse concept introduces vague cause-effect relationships that dilute tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details (algae's emerald flood, barnacle metaphors) that enhance mood. The underwater decay contrasts beautifully with bureaucratic permanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Storytelling achieves strong emotional resonance through metaphors (e.g., bittersweet grit, "new cartographies") and layered themes of salvage/redemption. Subtext about archiving collapse works powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors and unexpected combinations (phantom bureaucracy, multiverse orchards) elevate it above formulaic speculative fiction. Avoids over-explanation of fantastical elements for stronger mystery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story mostly integrates elements cohesively, though multiverse framework feels underutilized. Ending resonates thematically, but some elements (kitchen wisdom's application) lack concrete narrative anchoring.</comment>
