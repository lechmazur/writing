<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Midori's duality as a dutiful scholar and rebellious preserver of forbidden art is consistent and drives her actions, though deeper emotional texture is occasionally sacrificed for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot adheres to a clear trajectory (from quiet defiance to risky mission to quiet resolution), but the tight word count occasionally flattens the tension between stakes and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of sterile futurism (capsule hotel) and atmospheric historical detail (well in Edo) creates striking contrasts, though some sensory details verge on decorative rather than narrative-driven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "sterile river" and "plume of secret wind" elevate the prose, while the theme of forbidden memory resonates emotionally. Some imagery risks over-refinement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wire coil and well method feel inventively rooted in the story’s rules, though occasional ornate phrasing ("gravity felt generous") flirts with self-indulgence. Subversion of academic authoritarianism feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements cohesively, but some—like the capsule hotel’s role—serve more as backdrop than active narrative force. The thematic fusion of erasure and preservation lingers.</comment>
