<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure is mostly coherent within constraints, but pacing stumbles slightly during the shift from translation to communal singing; the arc is complete but not entirely seamless.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong, but the story leans on its imagery and concept more than a fully realized emotional or thematic payoff that prestigious outlets demand.</comment>
