<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment> Tomas' weariness as a locksmith is clear, but motivations could delve deeper into personal stakes. Calderon’s menace is vivid but lacks backstory to fully justify his schemes. Their dynamic drives the conflict effectively despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Taut pacing ties the pottery class to the throne’s trap seamlessly. The locked throne as climax is logical, though the hinge substitution feels slightly under-explained. The ending’s metaphorical "opening" resonates.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment> Lush, precise details (porcelain domes, painted jars) create a mythic yet tangible colonial town. The orchard-as-maze motif and vine-choked throne amplify tension and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment> Vivid symbolism (gloved owls as blind spies, the unclaimed throne as power’s trap) elevates the narrative. The resolution’s tension between preservation and subversion lingers thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment> Avoids tropes through meticulous craftsmanship: the gloves’ animation, the throne’s false locking mechanism. Subtle subversions (e.g., "demure audacity" as calculated deception) feel human, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment> Seamless fusion of elements (gloves, orchard, throne) creates a cohesive, allegorical tale. The tight focus on a pivotal moment avoids feeling constrained by length.</comment>
