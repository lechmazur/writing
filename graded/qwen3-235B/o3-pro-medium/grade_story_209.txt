<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations (truth-seeking, familial guilt) are visceral but conveyed through symbols rather than organic emotional range; actions align with conceptual archetype but lack textured psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot pivots cleanly on the hairbrush's dual role but relies on heavy metaphorical logic rather than narrative momentum; convergence of hospital/echo scenes feels thematically tidy rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich Gothic-industrial atmosphere with concrete sensory details (arc smell, static gravel) creates immersive tension between decay and revelation; occasionally strains credibility with excessive conceptual scenery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylistic bravado with precise metaphoric machinery (rivers of deception, electrical catharsis) elevates beyond gimmickry; emotional subtext resonates through structural symmetry of railway maps/human connections.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing esoteric tech-poetics, but occasionally indulges in baroque abstraction that obscures human stakes; emotional core is shown through actions, not just stated regrets.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic gears rather than arbitrary tokens, yet some contrivance in making every assigned component carry symbolic weight; concision often masks underexplored tensions between realism and allegory.</comment>
