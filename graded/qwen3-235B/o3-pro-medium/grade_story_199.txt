<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "overzealousness" feels more like obsession than active drive; motivation derived from inherited mystery lacks emotional depth or vulnerability, reducing psychological complexity; protagonist remains enigmatic rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves via surreal metaphors rather than organic cause-and-effect; poetic momentum compensates for contrived instructions from notebook; ending satisfies thematically but feels preordained rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (fermented figs, thunderberry taste) and haunting post-apocalyptic setting create immersive, eerie atmosphere; every environmental detail reinforces thematic preoccupations with memory and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and daring metaphors elevate the text; theme of absence-as-divinity offers intellectual resonance; emotional undercurrents remain elusive despite linguistic richness; ending feels cryptically profound but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original mythologizing of bureaucratic collapse and ecological transformation impresses; occasional reliance on metaphor clusters (recurring origami/chimes/pollen imagery) borders on mannered; tone maintains consistent surreal gravity despite fantastical elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherence emerges through thematic repetition rather than plot mechanics; limited word count strains exposition of dense concepts but allows haunting tone to resonate; elements feel purposefully chosen, though integration occasionally seems compositional rather than instinctive.</comment>
