<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is stylistically rendered but lacks emotional depth; motivations are present yet abstract, relying on poetic imagery over relatable psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic events with poetic logic, but pivotal moments (tile speaking) lack narrative grounding, creating thematic coherence gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Densely visual setting evokes mood, but the studio's kaleidoscopic nature feels more decorative than integral to character or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and resonant themes elevate the story; the phoenix's paradoxical traditionalism lingers, though some imagery borders on self-conscious preciousness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally sabotaged by overwrought phrasing; the 'kink' motif and glass-stitching phoenix are fresh, but descriptors often prioritize lushness over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dense with meaning and aesthetic unity, though thematic abstraction may limit immediate accessibility; succeeds as a poetic parable rather than conventional narrative.</comment>
