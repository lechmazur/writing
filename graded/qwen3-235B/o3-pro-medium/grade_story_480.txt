<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (online fame vs. curiosity) feel underdeveloped; the exorcist remains an enigmatic prop rather than a dynamic actor, while the narrator’s blend of ambition and obsession lacks psychological nuance despite lyrical internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gripping imagery propels the plot, but the condensed arc—from receipt clue to algorithmic haunting—sacrifices clarity. The abrupt shift to the mess hall and the “feast of memories” strains coherence, relying on poetic abstraction over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually and aurally immersive; the decaying music hall’s “rusted rafters” and the club’s “stalactites of melted vinyl” masterfully fuse physical and digital decay. The mess hall’s spectral cutlery-as-tuning-forks is inventive, though its thematic link to algorithmic hunger feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (social media as haunting, algorithms as hunger) resonate poetically. The ending’s ambiguity—moderating a “feast where memories eat their makers”—provokes reflection on digital ephemerality. Dialogue is sparse but charged with subtext, though some descriptors (e.g., “quietly loud”) risk overwrought symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre clichés but occasionally leans into overly ornate phrasing (“static confetti,” “lank neon stalagmites”). Emotions are shown through gesture and environment rather than declaration, though the exorcist’s laugh-as-subtitle borders on affectation rather than human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated (receipt as map, “quietly loud” juxtapositions) but strain at the seams—how the mess hall “feeds algorithms” remains vague. The prose dazzles, but the story’s brevity prioritizes atmosphere over thematic closure, leaving some threads unmoored.</comment>
