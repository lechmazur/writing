<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's rattled exterior is shown, but inner depths of a shaken exorcist remain underexplored. Motivation for redemption is clear but overly pragmatic rather than emotionally resonant. "Inwardly social" trait manifests only superficially through "sly compliments" without deeper behavioral context or voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through puzzles to hidden room, but progression feels like clever set pieces rather than inevitable narrative. Each puzzle connects well to the next but resolution lacks transformative character arc despite the "synthesis." Pacing tight for word count but resolution feels rushed amid cosmic revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Electro-plasma constellations and humming copper floors create vivid, integrated atmosphere. Timeframe of dance lessons directly influences narrative through choreographed equations. Some overaccumulation of sensory details (sparkling shoes, mauve nebulae) occasionally distracts from coherence beneath the beautiful prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("heartbeat fox-trotting") and imagery elevate the prose. The "conspire to create cosmos" ending shows rather than tells thematic synthesis. Emotional resonance relies too heavily on visual spectacle over human reaction, but the concept of souls as micro-galaxies introduces philosophical weight that lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generally avoids formulaic writing with specific details like "reversed recordings of ghosts reciting chemical formulas." Some phrases veer toward ornate (e.g., "secret lung" observatory) that a harsher critic might deem excessive. While original in premise, the puzzle-box narrative structure itself follows predictable "hidden room" templates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist harmoniously but not indispensably. The brief form feels natural for this mystery but reveals feel rushed. Synthesis concept resonates with theme, but other elements (inwardly social, coy aggression) could be more thoroughly embedded. The final dance in a "newborn cosmos" offers memorable exit but lacks substantial thematic culmination.</comment>
