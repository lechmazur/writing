<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters are evocative but thinly sketched; motivations (scientific purpose, romantic connection) are clear but compressed, leaving little room for nuanced development or flawed humanity beneath the poetic surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gearwork plot progresses coherently through Morse code exchange, but the truce-to-dance arc feels condensed; resolution via map-making works within constraints though emotional stakes lack gradual build or lingering consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Immersive sensory layering (rusted metal, hissing steam, bioluminescent insects) creates a tactile, haunting steampunk world that thematically mirrors the fragile beauty of their alliance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (butterflies as imperial divination, love as "sabotage") combines with tactile prose to create resonance; some emotional beats risk being overwritten ("treaties inside him mend") but mostly earns its lyrical risks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in radium butterflies and submarine-based Morse code, but "wayward" apothecary trope and rapid-fire collaboration border on narrative shortcuts; avoids most AI-writing clich√©s but flirts with poetic overdetermination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively into a unified allegory; while constrained, the story suggests broader implications through its central metaphor of science-as-empathy; length feels purposeful but thematic depth might resonate more in expanded form.</comment>
