<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stablehand’s motivation is clear but thinly explored; actions align with traits but lack emotional depth or growth; voice remains static through surreal transformations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows through interconnected surreal steps, but pacing feels rushed in moments; beginning/end have thematic resonance but lack narrative closure; cause-effect logic holds but leans on dream logic to obscure gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and thematically cohesive; sensory details (groaning decks, seaweed, prismatic horses) vividly construct dream-logic; tone of “fierce repose” permeates setting and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly evocative imagery and layered metaphors (e.g., “archival longing,” lighthouse rebirth); subtext about art’s endurance emerges clearly; emotional impact is fleeting but purposeful; minimal dialogue suits tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality excels: prismatic horses, clown astronomers, forbidden reels avoid cliché; fresh metaphors dominate. Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally risk vagueness but feel intentional rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole; surrealism is deliberate and thematically anchored; brevity enhances mythic tone; the ending’s transcendence rewards reflection.</comment>
