<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (saving time-stuck girl) is present but underdeveloped; Elias' rebellion against the loop lacks full emotional grounding, though his tactile interaction with the lure reveals suppressed empathy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Focused trajectory from tunnel to lake maintains coherence despite conceptual density; loop mechanics remain ambiguously defined, weakening cause-effect clarity during the raindrop-triggered shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sound/light descriptions establish haunting atmosphere; quantum tunnel's physical logic feels inconsistent, undermining world-building cohesion despite sensory-rich imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (lure-to-minnows transformation, time-as-trauma) elevates thematic resonance; emotional impact diluted by overly elliptical character interiority despite strong symbolic closing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in trauma/time intersection; occasional over-adornment with poetic abstractions ("stormclouds of possibility") risks obscuring narrative clarity, though metaphor freshness generally succeeds.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements fused with conceptual ambition, but some feel conceptually detached (recess bell's significance minimized); brevity works as thematic compression but leaves thematic threads unresolved.</comment>
