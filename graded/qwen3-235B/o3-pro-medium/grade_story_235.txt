<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters function as atmospheric symbols rather than fully developed individuals. Asuka's motivations remain cryptic, and Jun's curiosity isn't deepened beyond surface-level loneliness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through poetic imagery but lacks clear cause-effect relationships. The meteor-guided painting sequence feels disconnected from the headmaster's role and Asuka's sudden disappearance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is evocatively rendered with sensory details (shoji screens, turpentine ghosts) but the castle's hybrid identity as academy isn't fully integrated into narrative mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink-moths, cosmic recipes) create resonance, but the story leans on lyrical abstraction over emotional stakes. The blank-book ending has symbolic weight but minimal payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original integration of pressed flowers as astral ciphers avoids formulaic fantasy tropes. However, phrases like "whispers smudging like charcoal" occasionally risk poetic overindulgence without narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as mood piece but struggles with tension between lyricism and momentum. Assigned elements are cohesively arranged but lack transformative narrative pressure.</comment>
