<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's rashness is consistent but underexplored; motivation to protect postcards lacks emotional grounding; transformation from rashness to purpose feels abrupt without nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on vague cosmic logic; the journey from discovery to cosmic awakening is efficient yet occasionally strained in cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with tactile details (e.g., "moonlit dust") but occasionally undermined by abstract phrasing; setting deeply informs mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thought-provoking metaphysics deepen impact; subtext about listening vs. action is potent, though emotional resonance is slightly undercut by ethereal detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging cosmic mysticism with personal growth; some phrasing risks indulgence ("revolving galaxies"), but imaginative core and thematic cohesion prevail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious scope; all elements serve the arc; brief length amplifies poetic brevity but could benefit from one more layer of revision for tonal precision.</comment>
