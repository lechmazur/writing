<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks multidimensionality; traits remain theoretical rather than experiential. "Rare honesty about dishonesty" feels like rhetorical scaffolding rather than lived behavior. Motivation to "rewrite code" stated but unearned. Voice prioritizes poetic abstraction over psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows cyclical rather than linear progression, ending where it begins thematically. Gravity reversal and digital metaphors create momentum, but emotional payoff remains elusive. The funeral world-building provides necessary scaffolding but feels like a deus ex machina solution to plot inertia.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (e.g., "night blossoms," "leaves flipping like overwritten code") create vivid tonal cohesion. The sewer/orchard contrast effectively juxtaposes decay and transcendence. Timeframe's psychological collapse permeates atmosphere, though some metaphors (e.g., wind as "skeptical applause") border on preciousness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density risks becoming self-parody but mostly succeeds through relentless thematic precision. Breath as existential threat/antidote offers compelling subtext. Ending's "unvarnished truth" under-foot provides memorable circularity. Subtext about authorial dishonesty as creative necessity resonates beyond cosmic theatrics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrases ("chilling bedtime stories," "cosmic software") feel conceptually borrowed rather than reinvented. Emotional palette remains cerebral rather than visceral, occasionally veering into "smarter-than-thou" register. No flat emotional declarations, but character psychology stays trapped in metaphor networks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements feel symbiotic despite high abstraction. The story demands reader labor to decode its thematic machinery, leaving resonance in its paradoxical embrace of futility (rewriting existence while fearing scrutiny). The brief canvas works to its advantage, focusing on philosophical gesture rather than narrative closure.</comment>
