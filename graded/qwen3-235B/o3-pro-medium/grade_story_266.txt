<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's bleakness is atmospheric but motivations remain abstract. The transformation isn't fully earned, though poetic whispers suggest inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has cohesive arc but pacing uneven—clock's impact on sunrise feels forced. Connection between mastery and resolution is poetic but logically tenuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding exceptional: all elements (floating studio, incense ropes, neon consonants) create hypnotic sensory cohesion and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but contains occasional overwrought phrasing. Tension between light and gravity avoids clichés but occasionally feels like curated surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade>Elements form thematic constellation but cohesion uneven—some (clock, promises) central; others (train, studio) atmospheric but structurally peripheral.</comment>
