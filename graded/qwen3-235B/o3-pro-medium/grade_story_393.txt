<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters act as vessels for plot; Caleb's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or complexity, Mira exists only to enable the resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear chain of supernatural coincidences but suffers from compressed pacing; the final reconciliation feels rushed despite strong emotional payoffs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create immersive, eerie atmospheres in key locations; suburban vs. industrial contrasts and time-bound alchemy enhance the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., tar pit as alembic of grief) and resonant imagery; ending delivers thematic cohesion but sentimentalism undermines subtle magic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise and alchemical language avoid clich√©s, but some supernatural coincidences and phrases (e.g., "nervous fireflies") veer toward formulaic wonder-writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere more than most constraint-driven stories; the emotional core lingers, though the thematic ambition occasionally outpaces the brevity.</comment>
