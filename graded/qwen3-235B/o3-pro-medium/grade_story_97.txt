<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has a distinctive paradoxical trait and consistent motivation to seek forgotten places, but lacks depth in emotional evolution or meaningful internal conflict beyond poetic description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc within constraints, with beginning/middle/end structure intact, though some transitions feel compressed; ending provides resolution but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Evocative but abstract setting creates atmosphere; insufficient specificity in sensory detail prevents full immersion, with unstable dimension functioning more as symbolic backdrop than functional world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong poetic craft with striking imagery and metaphor; conceptually ambitious ending resonates, but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction; theme of measurement vs. empathy conceptually coherent but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original combinations of mathematical and emotional concepts; some risk of poetic abstraction veering into ornate clich√©, but overall maintains stylistic control and thematic nuance within elevated fantasy conventions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</question><comment>Elements coexist but lack perfect synergy; certain components (compass, recomposition) integral while others (timeframe) feel more decorative; ambitious concept shows creative thinking but execution lacks structural tightness.</comment>
