<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's heartbreak and guilt drive his actions, but emotional depth remains surface-bound. Motivation ties to assigned trait but lacks complexity in transformation. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Linear quest structure works, but rapid descent to spring feels rushed. Ending ties to beginning thematically, though cause/effect connections lack visceral impact. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Volcanic cave and skeleton librarians create haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like "ink on abandoned journals" effectively immerse, though some metaphors (auroral patterns) feel strained. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic imagery (scythe as regret) elevate emotional resonance. Subtext about creation from loss and cyclical healing enriches narrative, though occasional purple prose interrupts flow. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("tributaries beneath stone") succeed, but excessive ornamentation ("stacked corridors") borders on clich√©. Theme of evolving relationships feels tacked on rather than integral. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Solid cohesion despite numerous elements. Emotional impact lingers, but some components (seeds from bird) feel artificial. Brief length works but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration. </comment>
