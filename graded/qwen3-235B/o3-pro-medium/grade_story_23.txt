<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits (e.g., creative) are established but feel performative rather than psychologically grounded; actions align with external goals but lack interiority or emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on whimsical cause-and-effect logic; momentum is maintained through poetic action but lacks narrative tension or stakes to anchor the reader.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive but internally inconsistent; some setting elements (e.g., nanobees, ghost engineers) clash in tone or logic, diluting atmosphere's cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich in metaphorical resonance and thematic unity between creativity/restoration; ending lands with conceptual clarity, though emotional impact is secondary to aesthetic appeal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through inventive combinations (e.g., folio of leaves as tech-magic), but some phrases (e.g., "bottle auroras") verge on overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality and poetic texture elevate it, but uneven character depth and abstract plotting prevent it from transcending its constraints as exemplary work.</comment>
