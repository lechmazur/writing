<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters show nuanced motivation but lack deeper exploration beyond symbolic roles; their interactions hint at history but remain largely defined by thematic function rather than multidimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with tight cause-effect between symbolic gestures; the concise structure achieves emotional arc but relies heavily on condensed implication rather than fully realized progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere masterfully merges mechanical decay and emotional weight through precise sensory fusion (gears as birds, static as rewound regrets) that permeates every description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stunning symbolic economy: stickers as treaties, medals as scars, shifting engine rhythms as emotional pulse—every image carries layered meaning while maintaining vivid immediacy and original metaphoric invention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While occasional overripe phrases ("chandeliers bled dawn") appear, the work avoids formulaic AI patterns through deliberately unnatural juxtapositions ("clockwork audience" meeting childhood artifacts) that feel intentionally stylized rather than algorithmically excessive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock with exceptional thematic synergy—patient librarian's preservation vs. war's erosion, childhood stickers confronting hollow medals—with only minor looseness in the historical context establishment.</comment>
