<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive, but motivations tied to eroding promises and dance lack emotional grounding. Motivations for confiscating rhythms feel conceptually driven rather than organically human (or ghostly). The sentinel's obsessive need to learn dances through haunting remains psychologically underdeveloped despite lyrical surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure that resolves through dance-as-confession, with confiscated steps creating narrative momentum. The method (shared dance love) drives the emotional core. Some rushed elements (e.g., gramophone's introduction) but maintains coherence through atmospheric cues. Tension between possession and partnership sustains arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as character - the decaying lighthouse embodies eroding promises through brine-stained details and spectral echoes. Sensory details (phosphorescent scratches, seawater applause) create tactile unease. Timeframe compression focuses the haunting. Atmosphere dominates over plot but feels earned through relentless environmental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful subtext about artistic transmission through death, using ropes as dialogue between the living/dead. Metaphors avoid easy resolution (promises as dissolvable stone). Ending doesn't "solve" loneliness but reframes it as eroding rhythm. Exceptional use of movement as plot and theme. Only slightly undermined by occasional poetic abstraction overwhelming human stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through structural unpredictability - ghosts punished for teaching foxtrots, not typical haunting reasons. Some repetitive metaphors ("strand" references), but overall fresh handling of haunting-as-educational-debt. Emotional contours emerge through action (dance) rather than explanation. Language maintains stylistic control despite density - no flowery excesses, just concentrated intensity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leverages constraints rather than suffering them - the list's erasure maps directly onto the dance's completion. The element integration feels conceptually rigorous, though some (attribute "certainly possible") strain. Brevity works as metaphorical compression. Ending lingers in the bittersweet space between accomplishment and dissolution, achieving memorable thematic resonance within limitations.</comment>
