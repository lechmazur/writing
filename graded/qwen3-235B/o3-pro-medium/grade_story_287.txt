<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orion's torn visionary nature is established but underexplored, while Ezra's agency is limited. Emotional stakes remain abstract despite vivid metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc is complete but feels condensed; cause/effect logic holds, but pacing hesitates between atmospheric descriptions and plot progression. Resolution ties to the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive setting with rich sensory details (vines as "sentence fragments," hum of the cellphone). Atmosphere occasionally overshadows narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("light seeped like a question") and layered symbolism elevate the story. Emotional resonance is potent but slightly underdeveloped beyond awe. Premise exceeds emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Detailed imagery avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornamentation ("rotted globes bled oceans"). Concept is inventive, but character psychology leans on archetypes rather than complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are cleverly integrated, though some (like the child) feel symbolic rather than essential. The ending's thematic force overshadows minor narrative gaps.</comment>
