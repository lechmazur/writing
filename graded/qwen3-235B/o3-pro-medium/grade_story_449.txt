<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rowan’s "awkwardness" and cosmic role are present but underexplored; his motivation feels abstract rather than deeply human, though lyrical voice and internal conflict hint at depth without full realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from paralysis to philosophical triumph via doodles and baking, but progression feels more atmospheric than plot-driven; structure is cohesive yet lacks narrative tension to anchor the symbolic arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral details (galaxies, ozone, cinnamon) create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere; setting and tone fuse poetically, though the time dilation concept’s narrative relevance remains partly implied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors and subtext shine, blending cosmic and intimate scales; the ending’s aphorism and symbolic fusion of storm and silence offer intellectual and emotional resonance, despite minimal explicit conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly inventive and stylistically distinctive; avoids clichés, leaning into surreal originality. Dense lyricism occasionally veers toward opacity, but the fresh interplay of elements feels purposefully crafted rather than AI-generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere through thematic unity (creation via small acts), but the story’s poetic abstraction may limit broader accessibility; its ambition justifies the tight word count, leaving a lingering conceptual imprint.</comment>
