<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than deeply developed, motivations clear but inner conflicts underexplored. Strength lies in poetic function rather than psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tight structure with some compression issues—pacing between meal preparation and overload feels slightly rushed. Narrative arc resolved with elegance despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Uniquely rendered atmosphere with rich sensory details (e.g., "citrus steam," "carousel horses whinnying"). Fantasy elements cohere into a haunting twilight aesthetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("spectators twice-shattered by failure") and subtext elevate the craft. Theme of wonder vs. fragility resonates universally. Ending achieves transcendence without neat resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Linguistic originality outweighs occasional ornate phrasing ("tremulous twilight"). Avoids cliché through specific imagery—brass automaton "clicking hymns," meals as emotional conduits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly into thematic cohesion. Fantasy elements serve emotional truth. Brevity underscores the transient beauty of the spectacle, leaving resonant silence.</comment>
