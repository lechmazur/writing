<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivation ("rewrite fate") lacks emotional anchoring; reactions to surreal events feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear cause-effect chain (pen activates chaos → escape attempt), but the middle section leans too heavily on poetic imagery over narrative progression, creating momentum gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Postal facility worldbuilding is vivid and conceptually rich; combines industrial and absurd elements effectively, though some over-described machinery detracts from intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "music box") and tone (poetic fatalism) are compelling, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction; ending lacks concrete emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with inventive imagery, but leans on overwrought phrasing ("laughter in joyful despair") and occasionally loses narrative cohesion to lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition clashes with execution; elements like "rewind" and "forgotten patterns" feel conceptually prioritized over organic narrative integration.</comment>
