<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theron's duality as puppeteer/scholar informs his tactile interaction with symbols of control, but lacks nuanced internal conflict; his tear production feels mechanical rather than psychologically grounded, reducing emotional resonance despite clear motivation for truth-seeking</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Puzzle event framing and altar-conducting sequence demonstrate structural coherence, but the transition between decoding methods (stamps to tears) lacks sufficient causal connection; the revelation's emotional weight outpaces narrative mechanics</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie synthesis of decay and sanctity through sensory motifs (marble dust's texture, phantom melodies) creates immersive atmosphere; geometric ciphers in fabric exemplify effective object-setting symbiosis</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alchemy of emotion-as-instruction and revelation about empire-building through noble lies offer philosophical heft; metaphor density risks obscuring emotional truth, yet resonant core imagery elevates the whole</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids genre templates, but strained metaphors ("violin without orchestra") and overly mannered syntax occasionally undermine authenticity; emotional revelation feels earned despite methodical approach to symbolism</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean interplay between assigned elements creates cumulative power; certain contrivances (tears as alchemical solvent) stretch credibility but serve thematic through-line; lingering question about truth's cost lingers effectively</comment>
