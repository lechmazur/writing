<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Promisingly cryptic characters undermined by opaque motivations; actions driven by symbolic demands rather than organic psychology. No distinct narrative voice to anchor reader connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure suffices through poetic momentum; beginning-middle-end arc implied rather than dramatized. Cause-effect logic submerged under metaphorical density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive with precisely calibrated details (ozone scent, reactor auroras), but temporal physics remain unconvincing. Some descriptors strain toward novelty over sensory clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Frequency-tuning as healing ritual demonstrates ingenuity. Subtext about memory vs erasure lingers, though emotional weight diluted by abstract characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in paradoxical concepts (catapult hurling pain into time), but occasionally collapses into ornamental language ('caged auroras'). Character interiority sacrificed to aesthetic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visionary ambition constrained by execution inconsistencies. Assigned elements function as symbolic scaffolding rather than organic components; the borrowed dawn's transformation satisfies.</comment>
