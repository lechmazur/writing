<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's unique role as apologizer is intriguing but "wildly reserved" trait lacks consistent demonstration through actions or interactions; motivation is clear but some inner conflict remains unexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from forbidden act to sensory rebellion, but the connection between apologizing and mapping seasons feels conceptually hurried despite strong opening and conclusion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original fusion of ecological resistance with bureaucratic dystopia, but occasional overwritten phrases ("cosmic radio static") and abstract emotional states approach AI-generated grandiosity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elements synthesized organically to create urgent mythos; the precise, purposeful brevity rewards multiple readings through layered symbolism and political subtext.</comment>
