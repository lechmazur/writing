<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between hope and fear is vivid but underdeveloped; motivations feel archetypal rather than psychologically complex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows organically within constraints; the meteorite-ladle rejuvenation sequence is conceptually coherent but resolution feels overly abstract for traditional narrative satisfaction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original metaphors compensate for faint AI-like phrase clusters ("whispering iron" edges clich√©); avoids generic emotional cues through atmospheric subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements work together cohesively despite fantastical premises; brevity enhances mythic quality but slightly undermines emotional anchoring.</comment>
