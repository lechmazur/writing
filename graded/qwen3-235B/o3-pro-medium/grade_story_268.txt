<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Alia’s artful clumsiness as a subversion of threat perception is cleverly tied to her effectiveness as a subdued vigilante, but the ancient art motivation lacks emotional weight due to sparse exposition on her personal stakes or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Narrative logic holds, but the compressed arc relies on abstract concepts (e.g., mirror-induced guilt) without exploring how or why these generals are susceptible, creating a gap in cohesive cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral, contradictory imagery (e.g., “screaming silence,” “pixelated bravado”) creates a haunting atmosphere, though sensory details occasionally overreach into ornate abstraction rather than grounding immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, purposeful prose—like war-chart meltdowns as personal loss ledgers—creates haunting metaphor depth. Subtext about performative harm-reduction is intellectually resonant, though character emotion remains elusive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rejects genre tropes (e.g., vigilante violence) in favor of psychological warfare, but certain phrases (“swirling horizons,” “indictment louder than artillery”) verge on poetic vagary rather than precise emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thematic ambition (war-as-debt) elevates cohesion, but the story’s reliance on symbolic gestures over tangible human consequences limits its visceral punch despite stylistic brilliance.</comment>
