<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters convey assigned motivations through symbolic actions, but interactions lack emotional complexity; Rhizome's hive-mind voice subverts expectation but lacks individualistic nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows organically from wax-dripping ritual to vault destruction, maintaining coherence and urgency within tight constraints; the pivotal action feels both inevitable and surprising.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting with haunting sensory details (jangling vents, dripping wax, scuffed plug) creates a singular espionage-mysticism hybrid atmosphere that shapes character behavior and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (history as molten wax, foresight as dangerous commodity) and subtext about institutional complicity in ethical erasure; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic plotting through surreal tech-mysticism fusion; some overwritten descriptions ("merry bitterness curling his lips") flirt with purple prose but never fully distract from narrative force.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements harmonize to explore surveillance, memory commodification, and sacrifice; sacrifices brevity to thematic density but maintains crystalline emotional and philosophical clarity.</comment>
