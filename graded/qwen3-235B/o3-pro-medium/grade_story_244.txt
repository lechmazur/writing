<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atonement and resolve drive Shura, but interiority remains elusive despite poetic gestures; motivations feel allegorical rather than psychologically textured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Non-linear structure through environmental storytelling works in microcosm, yet key transitions (mask-to-labyrinth) lack narrative connective tissue necessary for full emotional payoff in tight space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dystopian artisanscape rendered through synesthetic neon/circuitry contrasts with organic decay (rosebush), though conceptual density occasionally overwhelms spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meticulous symbolism (circuitry as spiritual corridors, petals as guilt) and lyric compression elevate proceedings into metaphysical allegory; conclusion resonates with mythic economy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre banality through juxtaposition (sacred mask/tech ruins) but stumbles in moments with oblique phrasing that feels mannered rather than meaningful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Organic cohesion among elements (blade's directive guiding mask encounter) achieves metaphysical unity; final image of chromatic redemption lingers suggestively.</grade>
