<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inconsistent emotional depth; character's lukewarmness is conceptually strong but lacks visceral nuance beyond static temperament. The doormat's influence on decisions feels underexplored despite symbolic presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics are inventive but rushed; pivotal clash resolution via "sparks that sketched gardens" leans on poetic abstraction over narrative specificity, diluting emotional payoff within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting details (regolith towers, lunar silence) and metaphorical atmosphere (charred serenity, Earthlight) are viscerally executed, though deeper integration with character psychology is partially missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stunning imagery and metaphor ("ghost chords," "fragility of fear") create lingering resonance. Ending evokes thematic closure without sentimentality. Overly distilled prose occasionally sacrifices emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Resists tropes (e.g., mage as stagecraft artist, fear-combat via theater fog) with ingenuity. Sensory details (crimson dust, salt-scattering) feel organically human. Slight over-reliance on abstract phrasing like "newborn hope" as rare misstep.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize thematically despite occasional narrative compression issues. The doormat-relic and lunar fragility motifs create cohesive metaphoric scaffolding. Ending feels inevitable yet resonant.</comment>
