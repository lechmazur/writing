<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orrin's multifaceted freelancing hints at adaptability but lacks psychological depth; his motivation to preserve wisdom remains conceptually noble yet emotionally underdeveloped; the "inadvertently profound" moment intellectually anchors him but isn't fully embodied through nuanced action or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compelling central conflict and resolution within constraints; pacing tightens through steam-driven subterfuge and tape-heist mechanics; minor stumbles in connecting Orrin's initial notebook-readiness to his technical expertise; ending achieves thematic resonance but truncates emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk engine room immerses with tactile specificity (piston hiss harmonizing with quartet, gears as "wedding band reflections"); the atmosphere's mechanical pulse mirrors Orrin's moral calibration; wedding hush vs. metallic footsteps creates haunting tension; sensory economy serves the plot without excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Transcends genre tropes with metaphors as active agents (machines tuned to compassion, harmony through scattering); the "scattered harmony" theme crystallizes in both Orrin's philosophy and cityscape imagery; conclusion's aether-upload and tram journey avoid sentimentality while deepening existential resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of "greedy heirs" clich√© via steampunk tech and linguistic precision; avoids overused descriptors ("hissing" as both sound and thematic veil); subleties like the heirs' "champagne entitlement" suggest layered human flaws; occasional phrasing risks preciousness (e.g., "untold fog") but generally avoids algorithmic repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements interlock organically: steampunk machinery enables the cylinder's theft and thematic machinery, wedding timeframe compresses stakes, "scattered harmony" echoes through Orrin's transience; slight friction in tying "inadvertently profound" to a single epiphany rather than character arc; linguistic precision elevates cohesion.</comment>
