<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's traits shape actions meaningfully (e.g., "skeptically credulous" leading to conflicted loyalty), but motivation to reconcile past with present remains underexplored despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is tight and purposeful, with the decryption-as-confession method driving coherent cause/effect, though resolution feels slightly compressed given thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere merges organic and synthetic elements with flawless logic; every sensory detail reinforces the tension between rebellion and control, past and future.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Provocative metaphor layers (e.g., loom patterns as encrypted vows), emotionally resonant symbolism, and thematically aligned form (story about forbidden crafting becomes its own act of resistance) elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh tech-organic synthesis (holographic parchments on oaks) and subversive metaphors; occasionally risks preciousness but remains conceptually daring rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically (encrypted vows ⇒ loom patterns ⇒ grassroots resistance) while maintaining stylistic boldness and lingering ambiguity about whether the revolution will succeed.</comment>
