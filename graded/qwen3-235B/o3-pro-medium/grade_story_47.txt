<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lon's role as 'dutiful ward' informs his actions, but his personality remains underdeveloped beyond obligation. The 'eagerly jaded' trait surfaces briefly but lacks psychological nuance. The glove evokes memory but doesn't fully connect to his inner conflict between preservation and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through specific actions (voice notes, hidden phones, pit reveal), but some causality feels under-explained (e.g., actors readily accepting ghostly instructions). Pacing works within word limits, though sudden shifts (locked doors) strain credibility. Ending ties to beginning but lacks gradual buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary provides evocative atmosphere enhanced by sensory details (candle smoke, creaking phones). The skeletal mirrors and looped gasps create layered moods, but the abandoned orchestra pit's preparation feels underdeveloped in this tightly woven setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (velvet silence, skeletal smiles) create striking imagery. The central theme of confronting mortality through art resonates through layered subtext. The final transformation and 'audience/actors/ward united' moment achieve emotional and philosophical resonance despite the tight frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive in concept but uneven execution: glove and voice notes integrate well, but 'eagerly jaded' feels stated rather than dramatized. Brief length serves atmospheric purpose but sacrifices character depth. Ending lingers thematically but some plot mechanics require suspension of disbelief.</comment>
