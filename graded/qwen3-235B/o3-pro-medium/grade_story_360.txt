<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eluard’s meekness and sincerity define his interactions and decisions, but his internal life remains underexplored beyond these traits; motivations align with his actions, though complexity is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the quest’s stakes and resolution are logical, yet pivotal moments (e.g., dew drop’s discovery) lack elaboration, leaving narrative gaps within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (stalagmites, squeaks of goblin see-saws, glimmering roots) create a distinctive, immersive atmosphere; setting and tone harmonize, though the goblin society’s deeper mechanics are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (silence as answer, tapestry as cosmic text) and lyrical prose elevate the theme; tension between creation/recall and decay/forgiveness is poignant, though emotional impact is occasionally tempered by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts genre tropes (necromancer as humble seeker, riddle’s nonverbal answer); prose is lush but purposeful, with fresh imagery (e.g., "alphabet of creation," "quiet hymn"); avoids clichés through mystical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements into a thematically rich parable; some elements (e.g., dew drop) feel contrived, but the ending’s philosophical payoff lingers, suggesting deeper contemplation.</comment>
