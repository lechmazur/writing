<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellis’s guilt-driven reluctance and gradual redemption are nuanced, but his internal shifts sometimes feel abrupt or heavily signposted rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the tight word count strains the transition from decoding the tapestry to discovering the drum; certain beats (e.g., forging the drum’s repair) feel rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush contrasts between Mojave heat and alpine cold; sensory details like frost-bitten metal and thunder echoes immerse readers, though some descriptions verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (storms, repair, stillness) resonate emotionally; the finale’s thematic fusion of guilt and redemption is impactful, elevated by lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh subversions (tapes-try coordinates, brass horse from bells) avoid cliché; prose balances precision and poeticism, though occasional phrases (e.g., “nostalgic innovation”) flirt with abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, though tonal shifts and a few contrivances (e.g., exact tapestry coordinates) slightly undermine seamlessness.</comment>
