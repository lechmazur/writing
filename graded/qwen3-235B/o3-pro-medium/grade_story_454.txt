<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Flimsy internal logic; motivations reduce to a checklist of adjectives, “rationally emotional” never crystallizes into behavior, the character’s voice drowns in ornate metaphors. "Reckless" asserted but not thematically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a surreal journey but lacks cohesion. The transition through the map tear feels arbitrary. The mirrored selves and ritualistic swap of clover/badge create tension, but the arc’s emotional payoff is undercut by vague stakes and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually vivid yet inconsistent—haunted carnival tropes are overwrought (“starving neon fish”), atmosphere leans on clichéd grotesquerie. Sensory details overload but fail to distinguish the Breakers’ “reality.” Tone shifts feel erratic rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Lyrical prose dazzles but bogs the narrative in pretension. Metaphors (“jagged heart”) and mirrors-as-choices motif hint at depth, but the theme of fractured identity loses resonance through over-significance. The ending’s symbolic weight clashes with underexplored character logic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Obsessively stylized diction (“jubilant despair,” “collapsing distance”) borders on self-parody. Relies on “haunted” imagery as a crutch. Emotional beats are shown through spectacle but feel hollow—spectral hands and watch alarms substitute for genuine connection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story leans on surreal set-pieces to mask structural gaps. Assigned elements are crammed in (synchronized watches) or undercooked (distant companionship). The ending is striking but its thematic weight feels imposed rather than earned, leaving the whole ambiguously purposeful.</comment>
