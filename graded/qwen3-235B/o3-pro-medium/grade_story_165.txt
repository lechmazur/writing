<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but internal conflicts are underexplored; Eirin's "gentleness" manifests only through actions, not psychological depth or emotional nuances. Dwarves feel archetypal without cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a cohesive arc but pacing compresses key moments (e.g., justice's release feels abrupt). Logical gaps exist: Why does reversed speech convince dwarves? How exactly does the rebirth of the garden resolve prior injustice?</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered (e.g., "stalactites drip melodies"), but the underground city’s symbolic ties to justice remain underdeveloped. The dwarves’ obsession with solidity lacks deeper philosophical exploration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., reversed language as truth; stained glass as fragmented justice) are striking. The ending’s thematic payoff (hiding in plain sight) resonates, though emotional depth is unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Highly original concept execution (reversed inscriptions, melodic stalactites), but some phrasing leans toward baroque abstraction ("joyful terror"). Justice’s emergence feels more symbolic than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>ELEMENTS like the butterfly and reversed speech drive the plot, but the connection between "stained glass" and justice’s metaphorical weight could be tighter. The ending’s thematic resonance is strong but unevenly supported.</comment>
