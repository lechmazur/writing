<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits like "conventionally rebellious" remain abstract; motivations are poetic but lack psychological depth, relying on allegorical function over emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plots coalesce through surreal transformations rather than cause-effect logic; the arc’s poetic inevitability works within constraints but sacrifices narrative precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly immersive, with sensory details (inked dust, mercury-light) that are vivid and thematically resonant without overcrowding the prose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegiac tone and lyrical metaphor elevate resonance; themes of collective unity vs. self-erasure are potent, though the allegorical weight occasionally flattens emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the giant’s study/laundromat juxtaposition; while some phrasing leans toward ornate abstraction, the conceptual framework feels purposefully disorienting rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion leans on symbolic unity—assigned elements like the flower and "haunting delight" are interwoven, though the ethereal tone risks obscurity over accessibility.</comment>
