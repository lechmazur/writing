<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but underexplored; his telepathic sensitivity to deception and symbolic actions convey thematic resonance, but emotional depth remains shallow despite poetic language</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight 500-word structure achieves narrative progression through symbolic action; abruptness of rebellion and character's immobility at climax slightly undercut cohesion</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details like "cheerfully sputtering pipes" and "spectral fog" create a haunting, cohesive steampunk melancholy; atmosphere is the strongest element</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Magnificent use of metaphor ("inked banners," "fusion with mist") and subtextual themes of truth vs. control; emotional resonance through implication rather than exposition</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>ELEMENTS FEEL ORGANOGENIC TO STORY; THE COST OF RADICAL HONESTY IS POIGNANT, BUT THE PROTAGONIST'S TRANSFORMATION INTO ABSTRACTION FEELS SLIGHTLY CONVENIENT</comment>
