<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Osric's stage fright is thematically linked to his reliance on machines, but his internal struggle lacks depth. His motivation to confront the entity through inherited lies is hinted but underexplored, resulting in functional yet surface-level character development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight exorcism arc, but the resolution feels abrupt. The method (backward verses, key-turning) is inventive yet the transition from confrontation to victory lacks visceral cause-effect clarity, slightly undermining narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orbital debris as "unfinished prayers" creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (ghostly whispers, violet-lit petals) immerse readers, though connections between toy-assembly sounds and cosmic dread feel underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Literary craft dazzles: "satellites as unfulfilled prayers," petals radiating "dawn before language." The ending subverts triumph tropes, prioritizing quiet transformation over applause, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by merging exorcism with space decay. Some phrases ("crushed summers") border on over-poeticism, but the fusion of family legacy and cosmic horror feels inventively executed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole despite slight tonal shifts. The brevity amplifies tension while leaving emotional echoes, though deeper exploration of thematic paradoxes (truth/lie, hope/despair) could push it to masterpiece status.</comment>
