<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lorn's motivation for mapping is clear but his uncertainty lacks visceral interiority; his alchemical background shapes his interaction with the scale but feels underexploited thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot pivots cleanly on the scale's revelation but the resolution (map guiding convoys) feels imposed rather than organically foreshadowed, undercutting emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, synesthetic details ground the floating marketplace's surrealism, though occasional overload (e.g., "index fingers above head") momentarily fractures immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (scale's "oceans of fire," maps as "accidental constellation") elevate the narrative; the theme of mortal impermanence vs. collective legacy resonates hauntingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Worldbuilding feels distinctive but struggles with rhythmic self-indulgence ("centuries-old marble floor cached nearby"), with tension occasionally sacrificed for poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically resonant whole despite prose density; the story's brevity enhances its mythic quality while leaving emotional beats slightly unanchored.</comment>
