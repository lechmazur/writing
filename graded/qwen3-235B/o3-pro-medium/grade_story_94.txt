<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivations are implied but underexplored; Corva's actions align with her restlessly curious nature, but her status as a "femme fatale" feels underdeveloped. Reactions to earrings hint at complexity but lack emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a spiraling yet coherent arc; time travel's influence feels underutilized. The use of "zipping" and "tracking cloud trails" drives progression, though the resolution leans on abstract repetition rather than concrete payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is striking with vivid similes and sensory disorientation, but setting elements (e.g., "sky reflection pool") prioritize style over functional worldbuilding. Time travel’s implications are inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Provocative metaphors and lyrical prose elevate impact, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized. The ending’s reflective tone avoids closure, weakening thematic resonance. Subtext about self-awareness is undercut by overly ornate telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Excessive metaphor density and abstract descriptors border on purple prose. Clichés like "condemned comet's trajectory" and AI-esque phrasing ("smudged chalk" for storm clouds) suggest formulaic habits. Nuanced emotion is hinted but rarely dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a dreamlike whole, though some (time travel) feel checklist-like. Stylistic risks pay off in worldbuilding but hinder emotional immediacy. The ending’s orbit metaphor lingers but lacks earned resonance.</comment>
