<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Levon’s motivation to escape cycles aligns with his desertion, but his interiority remains abstract, with actions more symbolic than psychologically grounded. The "quiet" attribute feels underutilized beyond silence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot moves from breaking the mirror to the masks, but the jigsaw timeframe and sudden resolution feel disjointed. Pacing leans poetic but risks incoherence in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "compost steam" and "brittle constellations" immerse, but the jigsaw puzzle motif and greenhouse’s scientific premise clash in tone, weakening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("chlorophyll confession") and the paradox of "nowhere" as belonging are strong, but emotional resonance is undercut by overreliance on abstraction over character-driven stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in plant-communication experiments and mask symbolism. Avoids clichés but occasionally sacrifices clarity with phrases like "dizzyingly grounded," bordering on poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Fragments cohere into a meditative whole, but the story occasionally prioritizes lyrical prose over emotional urgency, leaving the ending feeling inevitable yet slightly unearned.</comment>
