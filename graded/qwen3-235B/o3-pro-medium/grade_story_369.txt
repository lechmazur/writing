<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quist's obsession with puzzles and contradictory emotions are consistent, but his interiority remains superficial—motivations are stated rather than organically revealed, and his "fanaticism" drives plot more than genuine psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Non-chronological reveals (letters, packages) create intrigue, but the abrupt resolution—lantern ignition as catharsis—feels contrived; pacing leans more on metaphor than earned cause-effect, though the hourglass mosaic foreshadows effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral details (gull-bitten skiffs, ozone-and-mildew air) immerse readers in a liminal, mythic space where the lighthouse operates as both prison and cathedral; tone and setting fusion is near-flawless, though some atmospheric details feel isolated from plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose elevates into lyricism ("glimmer his first daily clue"), with secrets-as-gravity as haunting subtext; the ending transcends schmaltz through the lantern's paradoxical phrasing, leaving lingering existential resonance; conflict between isolation and connection is subtly threaded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Verdant metaphors ("pale serpent seeking light") subvert cliché, but some phrases ("lethargic excitement humming") risk abstraction-as-substance; the narrative logic remains fluid, yet the "weight of secrets" theme occasionally flattens under its own symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a haunting whole despite the premise’s New Agey edge; the lighthouse-as-symbol feels over-determined, but the string’s physicality grounds the abstraction—minor flaws barely dent its haunting, ambiguous power.</comment>
