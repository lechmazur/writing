<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lodovico's role feels underexplored, though the smuggler's paradoxical identity creates compelling contradictions. The protagonist's internal logic holds, but lacks emotional depth beyond thematic function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight structure with clear beginning/middle/end within constraints. Pacing mostly controlled, though the butterfly's sudden use disrupts the tension momentarily before resolving effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding achieves immersive cohesion through evocative details like the "IV tube curtain" and anesthetic hiss. The desiccated setting enhances both plot and character motivation with atmospheric precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterfly/drought polygons) operate on multiple symbolic levels. Ending delivers thematic payoff through subtext rather than exposition, balancing cynicism with quiet tragedy in a tightly-woven narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive concepts like "actuarial anesthesiologists." Writing remains purposeful despite occasional ornate phrasing. Emotional resonance emerges through layered subtext rather than direct statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements interlock with organic complexity—empathy as commodity requires this specific drought center, butterfly, and smuggler. Brief form enhances rather than limits thematic scope through concentrated precision.</comment>
