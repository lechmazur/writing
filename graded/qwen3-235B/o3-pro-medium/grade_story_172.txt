<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characterization leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction over psychological depth; Lira's "accidental heroism" feels narratively imposed rather than organically earned through action or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is propelled by vivid imagery more than causal logic, with the final resolution relying on poetic inversion rather than dramatic tension; the word count restricts full exploration of time-bending mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-laden worldbuilding creates a cohesive uncanny atmosphere through tactile details like phosphorescent footprints and "un-clicking" cameras; spatial-temporal manipulation feels viscerally situated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transcendent use of metaphor ("reverse-wishing," architectural dissolution) achieves haunting thematic resonance about rewriting fate; ending feels inevitable yet surprising in its quiet subversion of prophetic determinism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids predictable structure through nonlinear cause-effect relationships and metaphors that deepen rather than decorate; some ornate phrasing risks preciousness but generally serves atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements merge into a conceptually ambitious whole; the recursive relationship between time and space in combating prophecy feels fresh, though character-subtext integration could be stronger.</comment>
