<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's 'eager' vigilance and tech-driven role are distinctive, but their internal stakes and arc remain underexplored despite a unique premise. The wager drives motivation clearly but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from data-hunting to spectral dialogue, but the abrupt resolution via sewing-box internet forums strains suspension of disbelief. Pacing is tight yet occasionally perfunctory in unifying logic and magic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Villa’s juxtaposition of ancient tech and spectral data sings: lavender threads sealing digital-era "echoes" and marble meeting polymers create haunting sensory synergy. Minor tonal dissonance in some tech terminology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "data and dust share a heartbeat") and thematic resonance between obsolete forums and eternal longing elevate the story. Dialogue is sparse yet purposeful; ending lingers with bittersweet ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original in blending AI-era logic with ghost lore, though occasional ornate phrases ("ruthless kindness") risk abstraction over emotional specificity. Avoids clichéd hauntings but leans slightly too heavily on tech jargon.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a speculative parable about connection but strains coherence at conceptual fault lines—ghostly URLs and organic polymers strain plausibility without sufficient mythos.</comment>
