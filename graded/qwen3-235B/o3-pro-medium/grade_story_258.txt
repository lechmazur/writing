<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve dances is clear but underexplored; "jaded wonder" is stated more than shown through nuanced behavior. The locksmith trait adds little beyond map/lock resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from arrival to resolution, but pacing leans into poetic abstraction over mechanical clarity. The action of "prancing" drives the narrative but could use tighter cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create a haunting, otherworldly atmosphere; the drifting orchard and cyclone of whispers blend surrealism and physicality masterfully. Atmosphere sustains thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (dance-as-memory, locks-as-language) and haunting imagery elevate the narrative. Ending resonates thematically, though some emotional beats risk vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unique mythopoetic approach avoids tropes, but "dusty yearbooks" and "choreographic compass" lean into occasionally florid abstraction. Subtext is present but occasionally opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but over-relies on poetic density; some assigned elements (e.g., yearbooks) strain believability. Leverages constraint creatively but lacks deeper emotional anchoring.</comment>
