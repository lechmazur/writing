<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gerda’s 'docile bruiser' attribute is inconsistently realized—her calmness surfaces, but her physicality dominates. Her motivation to “mold a myth” lacks emotional weight despite abstract logic. Actions (e.g., apologetic violence) hint at nuance but don’t fully cohere into a distinct psychological portrait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear hero’s journey arc, driven by the baton’s mythic allure. Rhythm-as-navigation cleverly ties to the drum solos, though the denouement feels abrupt despite thematic elegance. Pacing is taut but occasionally sacrifices tension for poetic brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion—the greenhouse’s mossy air, the baton’s tactile warmth, the drum-synched rhythm—creates an eerie, cohesive atmosphere. The setting’s menace and mythic tone are inseparable from its lush, thorn-studded details. Only minor tonal dissonance arises from the whimsical “Bashnan”/Latin gag.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (“warnings breathed petaled”) and the myth-vs-reality theme resonate powerfully. The ending’s silent communion between Gerda and the dead elevates the narrative, though the absence of dialogue slightly dilutes character depth. Prose is lyrical without veering into excess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the baton’s subversion of resurrection tropes and the language-as-barrier motif. Some descriptors (“unhinged percussion”) flirt with overwriting, but the fusion of violence and tenderness feels fresh. Logical gaps (e.g., baton’s warmth) are forgivable as poetic shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s tight focus on Gerda’s journey ensures cohesion. Assigned elements are woven into the plot’s spine, though the drum solos’ role remains atmospheric rather than integral. The ending lingers thematically, framing myth-making as collaborative yet transient.</comment>
