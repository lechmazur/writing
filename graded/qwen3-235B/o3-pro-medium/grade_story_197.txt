<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Quillon's con-artist traits manifest in bargaining with nightmares, but lack deeper psychological dimensionality; motivations are implied through action but lack introspective weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent progression from infiltration to lullaby creation; pacing occasionally loses urgency in atmospheric digressions but maintains momentum through kinetic verbs and surreal cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges dream logic and tangible dread through synesthetic details (graphite arrows, hissing nightmares); setting elements (tree, nursery) act as symbolic conduits rather than shallow decor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose achieves poetic density with "unscrambling sticky notes" and "hiss becoming treble clefs," creating thematic resonance about harmony born from terror; ending's emotional subtext transcends explicit narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original metaphors dominate, though occasional adverb clusters ("delicately," "suddenly") and high-fantasy motifs border on self-indulgent; emotional ambiguity feels intentional rather than deficient.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Story thrives as a compressed prose poem but struggles as conventional narrative; thematic cohesion emerges from tension between control/chaos, though mechanical use of some elements limits transcendence.</comment>
