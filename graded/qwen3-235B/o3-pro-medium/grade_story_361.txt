<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neal's mechanical intuition and link to the dice are well-integrated, but his "mild-mannered" trait remains underexplored beyond passive determination. Rima's role is intriguing but thinly sketched, weakening secondary character impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plotted with strong symbolic logic (dice to equations to resistance), but the abrupt shift from schoolhouse to diner lacks visceral transitions. Pacing is tight yet occasionally cryptic, requiring reader inference.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Retro-futurism thrives in tactile contrasts—chrome jukeboxes vs. wood stoves, bullet-hole skylight—while the smell of tallow-espresso fusion embeds narrative logic into atmosphere. Sensory worldbuilding exceptional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphysical metaphors (chance/lattice, chalk as rescue) resonate thematically. The climax's synesthetic knowledge transfer (taste+math) is striking, though some abstract phrasing risks vagueness. Ending balances pragmatism and myth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through hybrid aesthetics (indigenous science fiction) and layered symbolism. Occasional overuse of rhythmic repetition ("stove flame," "hearth") teeters toward grandiosity, but the voice retains distinctiveness amid ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Coherence amid dense imagery attests to tight integration of elements, though the brevity leaves some thematic threads (e.g., Neal's personal growth) implicit. Lingering impact stems from its urgent cultural preservation metaphor.</comment>
