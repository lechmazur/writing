<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ilan's internal conflict emerges late; narrator's perspective remains underdeveloped; motivations (for self-sacrifice and documentation) hinted but lack psychological depth; character voices often blur into poetic abstraction rather than distinct human beings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Time-travel framework provides strong structural spine; beginning/end connection through sketches/camera creates circularity; pacing tightens as trades dissolve faster; occasional tonal whiplash between bureaucratic Institute and 19th-century scenes slightly disrupts flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's pulse â€“ olfactory details (burnt parchment), tactile decay (browning pigments), and surreal temporal eddies create immersive paradox of "vanished yet living" environments; revolution's hush contrasts with artisan perseverance deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Conscious fireflies" metaphor elevates mechanical process to poetry; subtext of observer as participant in cultural erasure lingers; ending achieves quiet tragedy through understated "vow to reexamine" rather than melodramatic self-immolation, though emotional payoff could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rarely indulges in empty ornamentation; "temporal carpentry" and "perfumed hallucinations" exemplify precise, purposeful metaphors; avoids trope of "time tourist" by making documentation an act of cannibalizing memory; tonal consistency maintained despite structural leaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually rather than feeling imposed; brevity serves elegiac structure; hieroglyph method and silent revolution setting reveal layered thinking; lacks deeper exploration of record-keeping as its own form of preservation failure.</comment>
