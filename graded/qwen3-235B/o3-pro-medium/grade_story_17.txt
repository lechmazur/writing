<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's guilt and redemption desire are clear, but motivations lack deeper nuance; actions align with traits but emotional depth feels occasionally superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has clear arc but relies on abrupt transitions; eulogy catalyst and ritual resolution feel purposeful, though pacing within the word limit occasionally strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends gothic and mundane successfully (e.g., burnt sage vs. gravestones), but the supernatural elements need more sensory grounding to fully integrate with reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("bowl glimmering like a reluctant star") elevate craft; the theme of inherited shame vs. self-forgiveness is effectively intertwined with subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes; some phrases veer into ornate territory ("contraband bees"), but unique tone and mythopoeic genealogy concept feel cohesive and unexpected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work together for thematic unity but strain under scrutinyâ€”eulogy analysis as methodology feels underexplored; short length aids but doesn't necessitate this plot.</comment>
