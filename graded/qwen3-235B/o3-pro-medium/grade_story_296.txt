<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Unsung traveler lacks psychological depth; motivation to map spiritual paths feels abstract without concrete emotional grounding or consistent behavior to justify actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative arc is conceptually circular but suffers from abrupt transitions; the traveler's disappearance and protagonist's transformation occur without sufficient causal logic or resolution of tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Submarine setting creates intrigue but fails to integrate thematically with spiritual themes; atmospheric details (e.g., fluorescent buzz) exist superficially rather than shaping character choices or conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical framework (holograms as calligraphy, chaos as beauty) elevates craft, but reliance on abstract, unearned emotional declarations weakens visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Striking image clusters (e.g., "wood broken by pressure") contrast with clich√©d motifs ("heartbeat-shaped routes"); prose oscillates between fresh and pretentious, straining credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>High-concept ambition clashes with uneven execution; symbolic elements coexist uneasily, and the ending prioritizes poetic closure over meaningful thematic resonance.</comment>
