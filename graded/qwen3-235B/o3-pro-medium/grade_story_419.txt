<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characterâ€™s traits drive action through forging and empathy, but voice lacks distinctiveness; motivations align with actions yet remain surface-level despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end exist within constraints, with heartbeat as emotional throughline, but pacing stumbles slightly during doll awakening sequence and relies on rapid closures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create oppressive beauty, but post-human timeframe inconsistently maintained (e.g., "echoing pulses" contradicts memory extinction) and atmospheric tension underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., fused glass as legacy) resonate thematically; closing image of "horizons for whoever might awaken next" elevates emotional weight; subtext about living tradition transcends surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in blending steampunk spirituality with artisan heritage; avoids genre tropes but occasionally succumbs to ornate phrasing ("porcelain gloom") that detracts from clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Elements coalesce into meditation on cultural continuity; slight awkwardness in how time constraint influences pacing and the dollhouse unfolding feels artificially neat, yet lingers memorably.</comment>
