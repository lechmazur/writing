<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist's internal conflict is conceptually rich but lacks deeper emotional nuance that would bind his elevator repair work to his spiritual burden. His dialogue-free resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies heavily on symbolic gestures replacing sustained dramatic tension. The inciting action (collapse of castle) and resolution (cutting "strands") occur with minimal psychological buildup, though the circularity between beginning and ending is effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lush, precise sensory details (salt, resin, silent pressure) create an uncanny atmosphere that transcends the premise. The sand castle lab's fragility mirrors the protagonist's psyche, while the withheld sound becomes a physical force shaping the narrative space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (gears, strands, dissonance) unify the narrative; the ghostly silence-as-pressure conceit is striking. The protagonist's final self-awareness feels earned through concrete physical actions rather than abstraction. Ending's thematic clarity elevates the work's impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids most genre tropes through meticulous imagery and conceptual inversion (e.g., "noiseless thunder"). Some phrases (e.g., "unfinished histories like wet cloaks") verge on overwrought, but the central metaphor of "dissection" as emotional catharsis feels inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements cohere thematically rather than arbitrarily. The brevity enhances focus on pivotal moments, though the compressed arc sacrifices deeper character excavation. Lingering questions about "release" mechanics could enrich post-reading reflection.</comment>
