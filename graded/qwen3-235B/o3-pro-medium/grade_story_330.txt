<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Narrative privileges imagery over character interiority; motivations (redemptive vow) are declared more than dramatized. The knight's "dejection" remains atmospheric trope rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on mystical event scaffolding; the clock's strike as catalyst feels more magical than narratively earned. Forward momentum exists but leans on surreal metamorphosis rather than character-driven stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, synesthetic world-building creates tangible disorientation. The zero-gravity hall's "stuttering neon" and weightless masqueraders evoke cognitive vertigo that amplifies thematic concerns about upended physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., clock striking 13 as temporal metaphor) elevate the prose, but the ending's "tides of rising light" leans on vague transcendence rather than earned emotional catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Language avoids clich√© with phrases like "corridor of tide-glass" but occasionally lapses into baroque excess (e.g., "nested cathedral doors"). Conceptual innovations battle with poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story succeeds as high-concept tableau but struggles with emotional stick. The brevity works for mythic archetype but limits thematic resonance beyond the surface metaphors of redemption through ritual.</comment>
