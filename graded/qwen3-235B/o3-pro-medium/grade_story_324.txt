<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's insecurity anchors their internal conflict, but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient psychological foundation. The voice is distinctive yet occasionally sacrifices nuance for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A clear arc exists within constraints, but pacing falters during the psychic jab sequence. Logical gaps emerge in the urgency-to-resolution transition, diluted by compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere merges elegantly with themes of fractured reality. Sensory precision—flickering lights, vapor's texture—immerses readers while reflecting the protagonist's psychological fracture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose dazzles but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity. Subtext about identity duplication resonates, though emotional weight sometimes relies on abstraction rather than concrete character experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Coherence emerges from thematic repetition rather than narrative cohesion. Assigned elements create a scaffold but occasionally feel curated rather than organically integrated.</comment>
