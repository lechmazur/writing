<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's "confidently unsure" trait is superficially established through snarky delivery but lacks psychological depth; motivation fractures when the twist requires sudden identity collapse without gradual destabilization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot momentum drives efficiently within constraints, but the bomb twist's abrupt self-sabotage resolution strains cause-effect logic; temporal doubling feels underprepared despite clever final image.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Gallery setting's existential decay is vividly rendered through decaying pigments and voyeuristic patrons, though "vanishing point" concept remains underexploited as philosophical metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("sarcasm like roller skates," "kaleidoscope's centrifuge") astonish, though self-congratulatory wit occasionally undermines emotional engagement; ending's paradoxical self-investigation resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evolves thriller framework into meta-fictional critique through original conceits—detective-as-criminal, memory-as-weapon—while maintaining taut poetic voice free of genre clichés despite occasional ornate tics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story coalesces around identity dissonance theme through organically integrated elements, though pacing hiccups and tonal dissonance between action and philosophy prevent masterpiece status.</question>
