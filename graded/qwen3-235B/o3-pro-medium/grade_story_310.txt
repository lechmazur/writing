<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid but psychologically underdeveloped; motivations are symbolic rather than deeply explored, with transformation feeling conceptually imposed rather than internally justified.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but compresses crucial emotional beats; the pivotal self-confrontation feels underprepared despite effective circular structure and thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subaquatic sensory immersion is richly rendered but occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over spatial coherence; atmosphere masterfully supports theme but falters in physical logic (e.g., floating runes at conclusion).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Linguistic ingenuity and elegant metaphoric layering create lasting resonance; conflict between suppression and listening is viscerally shown through transformed public texts, culminating in emotionally earned epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original conceits occasionally lapse into ornate abstraction ('bubbles-chimes'); character logic contains human nuance in final gesture but earlier sections risk lyrical overindulgence that distances from emotional core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structural coherence and thematic unity exceed expectations for constrained form; elements serve a singular vision that lingers in its exploration of silence's paradoxical weight, though some poetic excesses threaten focus.</comment>
