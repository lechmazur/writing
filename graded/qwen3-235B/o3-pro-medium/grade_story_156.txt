<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations are implied through abstract introspection but lack concrete actions that fully demonstrate his internal logic; his "confused diplomat" trait remains under-explained despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but relies on abrupt, underdeveloped transitions (e.g., birds spelling "liberalize") that strain credibility; cause-effect relationships often feel symbolic rather than logically grounded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually striking, immersive setting with distinct textures (salt sculptures, dehumidifier tea) but occasional over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("plaster ribs") that dilute physical coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layering (birds as policy symbols, keys as intuition) elevates the narrative; ending delivers an emotionally resonant epiphany, though its preciseness risks simplicity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in translating avian choreography into diplomacy; avoids genre tropes, though some phrasing ("softly loud") verges on paradoxical abstraction rather than human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptually unified with lingering thematic echoes, though strained elements (bird-pattern deus ex machina) occasionally undermine the organic cohesion sought by its own "counterpoint" philosophy.</comment>
