<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinct voice and consistent arrogance make Vesper memorable, but limited emotional depth or evolution prevents higher rating. Actions align with traits but lack complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Epic scope compresses poorly into tight arc; episodic chest openings lack cohesive tension. Pacing uneven - slow atmosphere but rushed resolution. Cause-effect between chaos elements feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details create surreal bureaucracy-meets-chaos atmosphere. Twilight timeframe and "chemical memories" enhance mood, but some connections between objects (camera/chest mechanics) remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Irresistible aesthetic and linguistic play (metaphors like "narrative scaffolding") create lingering impact. Theme of order vs. chaos emerges strongly, though emotional engagement with characters remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors blend with bureaucratic surrealism (e.g., "coffee mugs sprouted wings"), but some phrases verge on precocious ("flavors...filch from chaos"). Character reasoning occasionally feels archetypal rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherence between elements exists beneath surface-level whimsy, but overreliance on striking imagery over emotional/logical throughlines prevents higher marks. Final impression memorable yet superficially thematic.</comment>
