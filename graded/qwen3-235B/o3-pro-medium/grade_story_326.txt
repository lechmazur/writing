<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation drives the plot, but 'sweetly fierce' is inconsistently demonstrated; reactions to the fan and fairies hint at complexity but lack depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—fairy migration resolution feels abrupt despite a clear narrative arc; cause-effect between illusion and fairies’ decision could be stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates assigned elements, but the narrow margins between human/fairy tensions and cosmic timeframes leave thematic threads underdeveloped.</comment>
