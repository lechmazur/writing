<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit but character depth minimal; archetypal traits dominate over nuanced human qualities. Actions align with goal but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but perfunctory; progression follows predictable beats without meaningful conflict or surprises. Resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is visceral, immersive, and thematically resonant. Sensory details create a hauntingly specific world that amplifies the emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong literary style balanced with purposeful metaphor. Emotional impact is clear but occasionally diluted by abstract phrasing; ending evokes wonder but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (sculpting music) but overall leans on familiar mythic tropes. Language occasionally slips into ornateness without clear purpose; emotional resonance is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</comment>Story cohesively deploys elements but lacks thematic ambition. Length feels restrictive rather than intentional; memorable atmosphere doesn't fully compensate for narrative thinness.</grade>
