<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned attribute only superficially influences actions; motivations feel arbitrary rather than organically connected to his "innocently guilty" identity; reactions remain emotionally distant rather than revealing deeper truths.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Assigned action of authentication structurally works as plot driver, but the scavenger hunt method feels like familiar puzzle-box storytelling; narrative completes full circle but lacks necessary dramatic weight for such a constrained format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting creates a hauntingly realized atmosphere; sensory details are evocative without becoming excessive; the "dusty starlight" tone permeates the world-building; skateboarding provides kinetic energy that works surprisingly well with museum setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and creative metaphors elevate the writing, but underlying emotional core remains elusive; resolution lacks psychological complexity given character's supposed moral dilemma; themes are conceptually intriguing but thinly explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Certain phrases verge on purple prose ("dusty starlight sifted through the broken skylights"); some sensory details feel decorative rather than purposeful; metaphors generally fresh but sometimes overshadow character depth; overall shows stylistic flair but feels too closely aligned with algorithmically-generated atmospheric writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Integrates assigned elements cohesively into narrative framework despite density; brevity works to its advantage in maintaining tight focus; style supports dreamlike tone; creates a haunting fragment that feels intentional rather than constrained by length limitations.</comment>
