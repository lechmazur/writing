<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character voice is poetic but lacks psychological depth; motivations (loyally disloyal guarding, horizon's promise) exist conceptually rather than through concrete psychological development</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot moves with dreamlike logic, but coherence breaks at key transitions (receipt-staircase, cloud cafe rules). Spooning time lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles with milk-horizons and memory-lattes but oversaturates sensory details until they mute emotional impact</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as pearls, foam hearts) create lingering resonance. Ending lands with tragicomic irony about guardian's exile, though emotional payoff thin</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in blending surrealism with retail routine, but typewriter rhythms and foam motifs reach for profundity without earning them</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade> <comment>Elements (spoon, midnight, cloud cafe) form a coherent mythos, but some forced connections suggest strained symbolic architecture</comment>
