<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character serves as thematic vessel rather than dynamic entity; motivation drives plot but lacks depth beyond philosophical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a discernible arc but feels compressed; cause-effect logic holds within abstraction, though pacing strains in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, vividly rendered world with rich sensory details; atmosphere enhances both character and theme through mythic, petrified stasis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism (e.g., parchment as desire-mirror); ending resonates with paradoxical wisdom.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>No derivative tropes; fresh reimagining of "doomsday device" as introspective tool; language is stylistically precise without feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High overall cohesion; abstract elements align with theme, though complexity risks alienating readers seeking narrative clarity.</comment>
