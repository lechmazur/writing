<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Jaggon's boastful voice and transformation from arrogance to self-doubt are vividly rendered. Weakness: Shift from vanity to self-suspicion lacks sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Clear arc from delusion to revelation. Weakness: Pacing falters during the revelationâ€”critical moments feel rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Chillingly surreal wasp-nest atmosphere with sensory specifics (waxy walls, stinging confetti). Weakness: Balloon-pop symbolism remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphorical richness (filmic illusion vs. reality), haunting ending. Weakness: Emotional beats occasionally undercut by overwritten similes ("sharper blade, honed by self-suspicion").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: Invented imagery (larvae projecting reality, confetti-shaped shattering) avoids formulaic constructs. Weakness: Occasional lexical repetition ("clarity," "boast") strains credibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strength: Unified vision with elements reinforcing existential theme. Weakness: Some narrative density risks obscuring emotional clarity.</comment>
