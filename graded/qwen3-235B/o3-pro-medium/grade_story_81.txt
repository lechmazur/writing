<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Characters remain abstract archetypes; emotional reactions lack depth, and motivations (seeking empathy to heal fractures) feel superficially stated without psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative flow is atmospheric but lacks causal logic; the plot feels like disconnected poetic vignettes rather than a tightly structured arc with rising action or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ethereal setting is rendered in lush, specific sensory details (iron-tasting air, holographic apples), though occasionally overwrites to the point of detachment from emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("sunrise in reverse") and thematic ambition elevate the story, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than viscerally felt due to limited character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While the conceit feels fresh, overuse of adjectival density ("thin as circuitry," "looping creek") and abstract emotional descriptions weaken authenticity; some phrasing borders on AI-generated texture without human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High-concept cohesion exists, but the storyâ€™s brevity exacerbates its reliance on vague symbolism over tangible narrative progression; thematic aspirations outweigh execution.</comment>
