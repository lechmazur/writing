<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Viola’s motivation to claim authorship is urgent and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract despite poetic descriptors. The “poetically rational” attribute informs her method but lacks granular manifestation in behavior or voice. The sandals-as-weapon choice aligns with her resourcefulness but isn't deeply rooted in character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from concealment to revelation, with the tuning-orchestra timeframe creating urgency. The corrosion of chains and salt motif anchors cause/effect. Some transitions (e.g., crowd chanting after digital release) feel abrupt but acceptable within constraints. Pacing leans slightly rushed in the final act, diluting emotional fallout.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bio-luminescent orchard's fungal glow and peach-lanterns create haunting visuals; sensory details (humming circuitry, cyan pulses) crystallize the theme of organic/technological fusion. The dissonance between sterile political theatrics above and the subterranean rebellion below is striking. Atmosphere occasionally overwhelms world-building clarity (e.g., how the orchard "records history").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., words as seeds, encryption as fruit) resonate thematically. The subversion of "plagiarism" into a literal code-woven coup elevates the conflict beyond political satire. Ending’s orchestral surrender to the crowd’s chant lacks specificity but avoids triteness. The phrase "destiny belongs to the hands that write it" is a potent, layered thesis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bio-luminescent orchard resists cliché, while "syllables as ventriloquist hands" and "vowels spilling like light" refresh familiar metaphors. Over-accumulation of poetic abstraction ("bruised stars," "cyphers of salt") risks ornateness, but the core rebellion against intellectual theft feels urgent. No visible formulaic gestures; shifts between scenes maintain logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements orbit the theme of stolen authorship, with the orchard-as-organic-archive and peach-as-data-bearer creating conceptual cohesion. The concise form amplifies the story’s mythic tone; no element feels extraneous. The political intrigue and fungal surrealism merge organically, leaving a lingering afterimage of rewritten history.</comment>
