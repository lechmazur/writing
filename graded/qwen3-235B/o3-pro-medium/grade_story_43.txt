<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hyden’s introverted nature shapes his actions (e.g., silent navigation), but his “wary” portrayal lacks depth—motivation to seek courage feels abstract rather than emotionally visceral. Interactions with the CD and emblems are symbolic but underdeveloped in psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot adheres to a clear arc (entering cathedral → discovery → self-reckoning), but pacing is uneven: the leap to confronting age-divided selves feels rushed. Resolution aligns with the premise, though some cause-effect logic (e.g., CD’s agency) strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The neon cathedral’s fusion of religious and digital decay creates a haunting, tactile atmosphere. Phrases like “flickering altars” and “fireflies under fog” immerse readers. Sensory details are evocative but occasionally border on overwritten (e.g., “servers prayed in binary” as overreaching). </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, vivid metaphors (“shattered constellations”), and layered subtext (courage as fragmented selfhood) elevate the story. The ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned catharsis. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh imagery (e.g., “neon wires dripped like intestines”), but phrases like “loudly introverted” risk pretentiousness. Emotional nuances are shown, not just told, though some AI-generated hallmarks linger (repetitive glyph/flicker imagery, erratic sentence cadence).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements like the CD and cathedral are tightly interwoven, but the story’s brevity leaves some concepts (e.g., the “storm-song”) underexploited. The self-reflective ending succeeds, yet the premise’s ambition occasionally outpaces its execution.</comment>
