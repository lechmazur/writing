<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually defined but lacks nuanced inner conflict beyond surface traits; reactions to supernatural and systems critique are clever but insufficiently layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant concept-to-resolution arc within constraints, but pacing uneven—suppressed anomalies section feels underexplored despite strong thematic scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive with idiosyncratic details (e.g., "electric algae lights"), but some atmospheric elements lean overly on adjective clusters rather than emotional integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful thematic resonance about fear’s necessity; however, some emotional beats ("tears pinpricked her lashes") verge on schematic rather than viscerally shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in satirizing bureaucratic utopia, but "glitch hologram" and "tribal dance" metaphors risk feeling slightly algorithmic; emotional gravity mostly overrides preciosity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere through sharp thematic framing of dystopian optimism, but the sabbatical’s emotional payoff could dig deeper rather than serving as narrative shorthand.</comment>
