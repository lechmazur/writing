<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lark’s foolhardy nature is implied through risky devotion but lacks tangible consequences or internal complexity. His steady creativity is demonstrated via kites and tape reinterpretation, but his motivation to commune with wind/waves feels abstract rather than deeply rooted in his personality. His voice is minimal, diluting emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is tightly paced and cyclical, with seasonal shifts marking progression. The confessional tapes drive the pivotal revelation, and the reverse-audio concept ties logically to the theme. The ending feels earned, though the transition from silence to stepping into the tide relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than clear cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ravishing sensory immersion in the snow globe’s shifting seasons—tactile snow, vibrating glass, coastal air—creates a haunting, enclosed world. The miniature scale contrasts poetically with cosmic themes. Atmosphere flawlessly mirrors Lark’s internal journey from longing to epiphany.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imagery like "spinning snow upward" and "shimmering grammar" lingers. Subtext about language as rhythm over words is potent. The ending’s ambiguity (“detached devotion”) invites reflection, though some metaphors risk overabundance. Conflict (man vs. silence) resolves elegantly, privileging “showing” over exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in tapes-as-translation and time-as-teacher constructs. Avoids snow globe clichés through surrealism. A few phrases feel overwritten (“coastal air tasting of salt cliffs”), but the tone’s austerity prevents floridity. Emotional beats are implied via action, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements like seasonal changes and the cup lid feel organically integrated, though “steadily creative” and star-gazing lean more symbolic than functional. The miniature setting and tape method are ingenious, resulting in a cohesive, haunting meditation on communion with the unknowable.</comment>
