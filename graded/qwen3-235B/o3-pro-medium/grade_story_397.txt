<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakness: Palad’s motivations and history feel underexplored; his transition from bartender to janitor lacks emotional grounding. Strength: The scalpel’s connection to his guilt is visceral, and Dr. Glass’s strangeness hints at hidden stakes. Character voices and psychological complexity remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Weakness: Plot contrivances (overlapping doodles revealing a map) strain credibility; resolution hinges on a deus ex machina (citrine coordinates). Strength: Tight word-count management creates a compressed arc; firework imagery frames the climax effectively. Pacing is uneven, undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Sensory details (copper sulfate, unharvested amethyst) create a haunting, memorable lab atmosphere. Weakness: The fireworks timeframe and crystal-growing setting work thematically but lack narrative interplay; connections feel superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors like "constellations trapped in molten blue" and the firework-lab parallel add resonance. Weakness: Emotional depth relies on surface-level descriptors ("optimistic desperation"); subtext about redemption is clear but thinly rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Strength: Originality in merging crystal science with moral reckoning; avoids cliché through tactile imagery. Weakness: Some phrases ("drinking mineral stardust") risk sounding formulaic; the scalpel’s code revelation lacks emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mixed: The story integrates elements with ambition (lab, globalized research) but uneven execution (receipt doodles as plot device). Tone is consistent but lacks thematic depth; the ending lands more as a concept than a resonant resolution.</comment>
