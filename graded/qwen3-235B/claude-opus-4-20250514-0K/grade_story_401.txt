<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character’s inherited guilt is clear but lacks depth in personal history; motivation to return the ring is coherent, but wilderness skills aren’t integrated into plot relevance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from decoded blanket to underwater act of reconciliation; pacing feels strained only in the abrupt transition to the vision scene, but resolves with emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is richly detailed (ship decay, phantom currents) and thematically linked to claustrophobic guilt; sensory immersion anchors the surreal climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong, with layered symbolism (ring, equalizing, blanket); ending ties theme of inherited shame to personal rebirth with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (ghostly visions, family guilt redeeming protagonist); writing style is vivid but occasionally overwrites (“liquid space” feels strained).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><grade>Cohesion is striking despite high concept density; brief length sharpens thematic focus, though the wilderness guide element feels partially incidental.</grade>
