<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack emotional depth; Marcus's transformation feels underexplored despite pivotal choices. Eleanor's abrupt shift from hostility to alliance lacks sufficient nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent, but the rapid alliance-building among xenophobic residents feels rushed. The conclusion’s emotional payoff is diluted by the compressed arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Midwinter imagery and greenhouse atmosphere evoke mood effectively. Sensory details like the seed pods’ texture and frost-bitten streets are vivid, though the enclave’s culture remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of unity and resilience are present, but emotional beats are told rather than shown. Metaphors (e.g., seeds as community) are competent but not strikingly original.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dialogue often feels didactic ("tyranny of indifference," etc.), and the enclave’s convenient redemption veers into cliché. Sensory details occasionally lapse into cliché ("sharp as broken glass") but avoid overt purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storytelling is competent but predictable. Elements like the seed pods are used well, but the narrative hinges on coincidences (a single elder’s archives) that strain credibility.</comment>
