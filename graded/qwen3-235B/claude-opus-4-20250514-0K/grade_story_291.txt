<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>World-building contains striking images (mirror maze, dying tree) but lacks total immersion; sensory details are unevenly distributed; setting elements like the dimensional rift feel tacked on rather than integrated into the logic of prejudice; atmosphere supports themes more than it builds a cohesive reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story attempts emotional weight and ideological depth with mixed success; mirrors and transformation offer strong symbolism but emotional payoff feels manufactured; ending delivers a poetic resolution without truly earned impact; writing contains beautiful phrases but often chooses statement over subtlety; theme is clear but execution lacks narrative complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story has recognizable sci-fi/fantasy elements executed with moderate originality; cosmic echoes feel formulaic while the mirror metaphor has been seen before; emotional resonance relies too heavily on thematic statements rather than character embodiment; avoids the most obvious pitfalls but falls short of truly distinctive voice or perspective.</comment>
