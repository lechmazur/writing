<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Maya's aloofness as an orphan is effectively established but could delve deeper into emotional contradictions during her transformation; her motivation to repurpose grief into action is clear and consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from inherited items to active adaptation feels logical, but the emotional arc is slightly undercut by the word limit’s constraints on gradual change.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (e.g., spiral dust motes, weightless debris) create a vivid atmosphere, though the timeframe of “garage cleaning” limits broader exploration of the anomaly’s effects on the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones as survival guides, fear dancing as courage) elevate the theme; the ending’s emotional resonance and thematic payoff are exceptionally executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sci-fi and grief avoids genre clichés, though the lottery ticket’s cryptic message borders on overused narrative contrivance; language remains purposeful and unadorned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements integrate cohesively, though some (e.g., timeframe) feel functional rather than essential; the brief length enhances urgency but slightly flattens emotional crescendos.</comment>
