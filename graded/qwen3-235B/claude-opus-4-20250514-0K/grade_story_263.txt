<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlowe's duality as a zealous yet merciful assassin is clear, but motivations feel slightly simplified despite moral ambiguity; the plush toy effectively reveals his inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc within constraints; cause-effect (reversed echoes, mayor's redemption) is logical but secondary character motivations could be more fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic worldbuilding with bioluminescence and "coral maze" immerses readers; setting and moral decay mirror thematic resonance effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegantly layered subtext about moral relativism; dialogue balances wit and gravitas; unexpected mercy as a nuanced narrative twist elevates impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Seamless integration of constraints; cohesive theme of moral reflection permeates narrative; leaves lasting impression of redemption's fluidity.</comment>
