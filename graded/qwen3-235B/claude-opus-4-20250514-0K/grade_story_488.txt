<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (to surpass reflected selves) is clear but lacks emotional depth; inner conflict hinted at but underexplored. Actions align with external goal (summoning device) but internal resolve feels abrupt. Voice has lyrical quality but limited distinct personality beyond archetype of "solitary summoner."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints: opening establishes stakes, ritual creates rising tension, collapse resolution. Pacing effective for 500 words. Cause-effect (summoning = transcendence) logical within quantum logic. Minor abruptness with "multiple selves reaching back," but thematically coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quantum beach details (tide-pool reflections, probability foam) create vivid sensory immersion. Atmosphere of fragility/tension sustains theme of decaying reality. "Corroded rapture" in climax perfectly synthesized with setting's liminality. Timeframe integration (demolition countdown) heightens urgency without feeling forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (self-reflections, "spark of invention") operate on literal/mythic levels. Subtext about creator vs. created resonates. Ending avoids cliché transcendence—emphasizes knowledge over artifact. Emotional impact understated but earned through imagery rather than direct telling. Theme of legacy vs. self-determination threaded throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases ("spike of invention," "quantum structure failing") lean toward genre cliché. Internal logic consistent but occasionally abstract ("timeless" vs. demolition timeline). Avoids purple prose through precise details (seaweed-temporal loops). Nuanced handling of character psychology limited; more thematic than emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interlinked thematically (timeframe → inevitability; quantum beach → liminality) but occasional forced cohesion (family celebrations explained through exposition rather than narrative function). Brevity serves as constraint-expanding choice. Lingering question about "transcendence cost" remains subtextual but not explicit.</comment>
