<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct, and the revelation about homesickness overcomes one-dimensional traitiness, but decades (centuries?) of backstory rely too much on exposition rather than actions revealing motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lunar phase plotting creates artificial momentum but feels mechanical; transformation arc resolves satisfyingly, yet the fortress' connection to protagonist's past lacks organic buildup within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glowing crystal walls mirroring ocean rhythms create visceral dissonance; time-warping rainbow canyon establishes haunting atmosphere but underutilizes sensory details beyond visual spectacles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (orchid's truthfulness vs. traded lies) creates intellectual resonance; transformation denouement "shows" emotional reckoning through physical aging rather than stating remorse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clich√©s by making honesty the ultimate transformation, but moon-phase tracking and crystalline settings occasionally verge on ornate abstraction rather than emotionally urgent decisions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic unity through "truth vs. survival" lens persists despite tight limits; some elements feel like structural scaffolding rather than organically grown narrative (lunar charts, mirror's sentience).</comment>
