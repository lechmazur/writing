<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is richly imagined but motivations for thunder-summoning leap is underdeveloped. Fragmented self is visually rendered but not deeply thematically explored. Mathematically challenged trait is only superficially connected to character's actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has lyrical flow but lacks emotional or logical payoff for key actions. Dream-theft mechanics and thunder-summoning aren't fully integrated. The decision to plunge comes abruptly without sufficient internal preparation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-human atmosphere is evocative through precise sensory details. Treehouse isolation contrasts beautifully with tennis-as-common-obsession metaphor. The silence-as-punishment concept is hauntingly rendered through sparse yet vivid descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyricism elevates the prose with powerful metaphors about fragmentation and isolation. Ending lacks narrative surprise but achieves emotional resonance through poetic abstraction. Subtext about stolen humanity resonates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original treatment of dream-thievery and fragmented identity avoids recognizable tropes. Some overly-stylized phrases ("laughter that bordered on prayer") risk pretension but the unique conceptualization of time and memory feels distinctly human-made.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive despite ambitious thematic ambitions. Each element contributes to the melancholic whole, though the brief form prevents full exploration of some rich ideas. Leaves lingering questions about memory, punishment, and identity.</comment>
