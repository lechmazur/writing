<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psychological complexity; motivations are implied but lack personal stakes. The puppeteer's actions are intriguingly symbolic but feel mechanical rather than emotionally driven. Voice remains archetypal rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through conceptually linked beats but suffers from compressed pacing. The lighthouse's dual purpose as repository and rain-tracker remains underexplored. Abrupt shifts between tailgating context and archive revelations undermine coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric potential clashes with tonal dissonance - party noise vs solemnity. Effective flooded archive imagery weakened by generic descriptions of "centuries of sediment." The lighthouse's hydraulic machinery concept lacks mechanical specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (water/blood, oar as knowledge-separator) add depth. The absurd solemnity device works intermittently as ironic contrast. Theme of universal kinship is clear but execution prioritizes conceptual weight over human-scale emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Avoids overt exposition but risks pretension through abstract philosophical monologuing. "Specifically universal" becomes a crutch rather than organic motif. The genetic key trope feels algorithmically familiar despite creative lighthouse mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Heterogeneous elements create structural strain - sports tailgating lacks narrative justification. While the universal ancestry concept provides thematic glue, underdeveloped character interiority and compressed worldbuilding weaken overall cohesion.</comment>
