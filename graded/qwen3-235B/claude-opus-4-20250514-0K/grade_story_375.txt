<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear—revenge against dismissed theories—but emotional depth and humanizing nuance remain surface-level. Actions align with traits, but lack complexity beyond archetypal "wronged genius" tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-act structure works, but pacing unevenly prioritizes atmospheric pauses over forward momentum. The solar flare deadline provides tension, yet the climax feels more like a spectacle than a narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and imaginative—rusted steel, shadow-gorges, and mannequin sentinels create a haunting tone. Sensory details (e.g., flashlight’s "broken halos") masterfully blur decay and elegance, enhancing thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "language" of vibrations, "harmonious discord") and clear subtext about perfection vs. truth elevate the craft. Ending lacks emotional catharsis, feeling more like an aesthetic statement than a human story.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending science (solar transmitters) and surrealism (resonator mannequins). Avoids most genre clichés but occasionally veers into overwrought descriptions ("pressure behind her eyes," "star finally given voice") that feel more calculated than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story coalesces around its theme but sacrifices character depth for poetic abstraction. While atmospheric and conceptually cohesive, the ending’s transcendence risks emotional detachment, prioritizing "meaning" over human immediacy.</comment>
