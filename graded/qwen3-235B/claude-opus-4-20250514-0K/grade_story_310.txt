<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and consistent actions, but lacks psychological complexity beyond archetypal revolutionary. Sacrificing voice for the hammer creates intriguing paradox, but internal contradictions aren't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure within constraints. Pacing works for concept, though transformation of the hammer into "seeds" strains plausibility within established magical logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic sensory details immerse readers, but deeper integration of environmental perils (pressure, darkness) could enhance atmosphere's psychological impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (silence/power, transformation through sacrifice) resonate. Ending's understated triumph elevates theme. Some over-reliance on abstract statements rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blends tropes (underwater society, mute protagonist) with fresh details (runes as biological processes). Occasional overwrought comparisons ("hammer dissolved like sugar") undercut otherwise controlled prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synthesis of elements works mechanically but not emotionally. The story functions as parable but lacks visceral human stakes beyond ideological victory.</comment>
