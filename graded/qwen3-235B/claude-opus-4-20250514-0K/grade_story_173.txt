<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's actions align with her multiverse-mapping motivation, but lacks psychological complexity. Emotional connection to lost daughter feels underdeveloped despite thematic importance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear descent/revelation arc works in limited space, but the phantom interaction feels truncated. Multiverse concept strains internal logic of underwater setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Drowned bureaucracy offers rich atmosphere through vivid kelp-twisted architecture, but inconsistent waterlogged physics (air-preserved kitchen table). Some sensory details overwhelm coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative "water as currency" metaphor and rootlike trade routes create memorable imagery, but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstractions. Ending attempts thematic resonance that remains under-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Combines unusual elements (drowned city/multiverse) with poetic language but contains purple prose tendencies ("tears of trade routes"). Some phrasing ("trustworthy unique") feels jargon-heavy rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Successfully creates poetic atmosphere and intriguing concepts, but struggles to fully synthesize multiverse trade and emotional through-line. Feels conceptually ambitious but narratively undercooked.</comment>
