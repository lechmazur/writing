<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character depth is implied through actions and dialogue, but motivations lack layered exploration; Marlowe’s eccentricity as a cartographer feels more symbolic than fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure relies on thematic repetition rather than narrative progression; the pruning metaphor sustains cohesion, but the compressed arc feels truncated despite elegant framing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through stark sensory contrasts (solar panels vs. dying trees) and tone; the setting’s thematic weight is undercut by underdeveloped temporal shifts during workshops.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (pruning futures, maps as acts of erasure) and resonant ending elevate the story; emotional nuance in gestures (e.g., deliberate forgetting) balances slight overreliance on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptualizing fate manipulation as cartographic pruning; some phrasing (e.g., “bittersweet grit”) borders on cliché, but subversive themes resist formulaic execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesion triumphs despite tight constraints; elements serve a unified existential theme, though brevity limits full thematic resonance. The ending’s introspective weight offers lingering intellectual impact.</comment>
