<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Banishment backstory establishes motivation, but psychological depth remains surface-level; actions align with yearning for connection but lack human complexity, feeling slightly idealized and lacking in contradictory impulses.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints but feels overly contrived; snowstorm feels narratively convenient rather than organic, resolution feels prematurely achieved without sufficient dramatic tension or struggle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges with emotional states—storm imagery mirrors inner turmoil, decaying setting reflects characters' psychological landscapes, sensory details evoke palpable loneliness and fragile hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Celebrates economy of language and rich metaphor; subtext about shared suffering resonates deeply; closure feels earned, not abrupt; silence-to-grinding-to-smoke sequence brilliantly 'shows' connection beyond exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps but contains occasional clichés ("hollow eyes," "ice-crusted scarves"); emotional beats feel slightly too symmetrical without enough messy human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements work together effectively to transcend their checklist origins; brevity enhances thematic focus; while slightly schematic, the metaphorical weight lingers meaningfully post-reading.</comment>
