<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations to transcend perception are consistent, but internal conflict lacks nuanced emotional complexity beyond abstract declarations; reactions border on allegorical rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a tight symbolic arc, but the transformation moment feels conceptually stated rather than dramatized; momentum relies heavily on poetic abstraction in a constrained space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ravishingly specific sensory details (e.g., "tears carved silver paths") vividly create atmosphere; however, the floating library occasionally verges on sensory overload without sufficient thematic grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (blood's persistence as miracle) and tension between "grand quests" vs. ordinary transcendence create intellectual resonance; some emotional impacts lean on lyrical phrasing rather than earned epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in reframing "miracles" as quotidian is strong, but phrases like "hope-worn" and "terrible, beautiful secret" dip into pseudo-profound diction; tone occasionally undermines emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exquisite language elevates the narrative, though thematic density occasionally obscures organic characterization; the story succeeds as philosophical artifact rather than purely experiential fiction.</comment>
