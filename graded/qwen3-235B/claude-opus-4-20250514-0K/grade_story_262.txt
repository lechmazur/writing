<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but occasionally rely on surface-level conflicts; emotional depth could be more nuanced though the core conflict is consistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong cause-and-effect logic and tight structure within constraints; minor pacing stumbles during the transition to the climax slightly disrupt momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion and thematic synergy between past/future elements; the bathhouse’s physicality deeply informs plot and character, with only minor descriptive oversights.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Potent emotional undercurrents and layered themes (knowledge vs. fear, cultural exchange) elevated by resonant symbolism, though the philosophical weight occasionally edges toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegantly merges sci-fi with historical fiction, avoiding outright clichés; occasional melodramatic phrasing (“righteously flawed”) and slightly uneven emotional beats prevent total originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exquisite integration of disparate elements creates a cohesive, thematically satisfying whole; the concise format feels purposeful, leaving a lingering emotional and intellectual imprint.</comment>
