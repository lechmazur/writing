<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is implied but underdeveloped; her shift from mechanical precision to embracing imperfection feels slightly abrupt. The grandmother's anecdote is underused as psychological motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a minimalist but coherent character-driven arc. The goose's return disrupts her analytical state, effectively driving the story toward resolution through visual metaphor rather than traditional plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting dominates as living character: salt-crusted bellows, glass walls reflecting the protagonist's deterioration, and ocean rhythms create immersive melancholy. The atmosphere relentlessly mirrors internal states through environmental specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of symbolism: bellows as metaphor for creative breath, tides as measurement against mortality, the goose's defiance. Subtext about empirical vs intuitive knowledge permeates each image. Ending avoids simplistic resolution by emphasizing process over conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Some abstractions ("worn and precious stir" lacks concrete grounding). Mostly resists clich√© through paradoxical phrasing ("thoughtfully thoughtless") and precise observations. Avoids AI-telltales through idiosyncratic metaphors like "1.3 seconds wing-beat interval."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story maintains technical competence but lacks urgent originality. The assigned elements cohere, yet feel curated rather than organically discovered. Leaves lingering impression of elegant competence rather than artistic necessity.</comment>
