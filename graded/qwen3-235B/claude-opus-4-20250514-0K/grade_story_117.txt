<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Meredith's characterization as a "relaxed pathfinder" is underdeveloped beyond her curiosity; her "wisely foolish" motivation feels more stated than demonstrated through nuanced choices. The dialogue with the ghost lacks distinctive voice, diluting emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution, but the rapid merging of the mosaic realities in the climax feels underdeveloped. The trail of musical notes as a method works conceptually, though its mechanics lack explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (frost-etched cobwebs, spectral piano) create an eerie, resonant atmosphere. The winter setting metaphorically mirrors the frozen creativity of the ghost, though the timeframe's role in the theme could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical imagery (notes as dewdrops, ghosts as unfulfilled art) elevates the narrative. The metaphor of "naturalizing" as liberation and the merging of realities enhance the theme. The ending resonates emotionally and philosophically, though some concepts border on being on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story avoids genre clich√©s through the unique interplay of the cracked lens and mosaic realities. While the "haunted composer" trope is familiar, the focus on unexpressed creativity as haunting offers originality. Language is purposeful but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative's emotional and thematic core. The brevity amplifies the story's metaphorical resonance, and the integration of concepts feels deliberate rather than forced, leaving a lingering philosophical impact.</comment>
