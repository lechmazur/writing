<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is defined by melancholic ritual rather than active motivation; internal conflict remains abstract rather than viscerally connected to actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structure follows a ritualistic circle rather than a traditional arc; pacing is deliberate but lacks narrative tension or transformation beyond atmospheric shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details (obsidian floor, prismatic shadows, whispering sand), though the witch's scrying room feels undercontextualized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose uses metaphor (sand multiplication as trauma replication, mandala as catharsis) and subtext to explore grief's transmutation into art; ending resonates emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©d gothic tropes through precise imagery and psychological nuance; language is ornate but purposeful, with moments of freshness in describing trauma's manifestation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on grief; brevity enhances the elegiac tone; leaves thematic echoes about memory and resilience.</comment>
