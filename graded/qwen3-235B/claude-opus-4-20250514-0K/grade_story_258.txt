<question>1</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Locksmith's skills and purpose are consistently portrayed through technical actions and emotional resonance with cultural preservation. Some motivation could benefit from deeper exploration of personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight 500-word structure maintains progression from discovery to action to transformation. Leaf metaphor and storm resolution provide cohesion, though some plot mechanics feel slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually lush descriptions (salt-softened edges, dancing orchard) establish mood, but metaphysical elements would gain strength from more tactile sensory contrasts like earthy scents or bark textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic imagery (dances in heartwood, storm restoration) elevates the narrative. Symbolism avoids heavy-handedness, though some transitions between physical and metaphysical states could be more grounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique metaphysical premise, though certain phrases ("her work complete") lean on storytelling shorthand rather than earned emotional beats. Style remains generally restrained and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Meets high-concept requirements while maintaining thematic integrity. The "storm as restoration" idea elevates it above formulaic speculative fiction, though some assigned elements integrate more seamlessly than others.</comment>
