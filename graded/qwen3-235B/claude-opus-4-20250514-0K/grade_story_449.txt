<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character traits are conceptually embedded in actions but lack interiority; motivation feels imposed rather than organically demonstrated through behavior or stakes. The philosophical quest remains abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pseudo-plot exists as a sequence of symbolic gestures but lacks traditional narrative drive; temporal manipulation serves concept over causality. The 500-word constraint exposes structural thinness without meaningful escalation or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally sterile setting; baking flour and storm-in-glass create intriguing textures but remain disconnected metaphors. Chrome surfaces reflect superficial atmosphere-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant imagery merges science/art but struggles to transcend poetic abstraction into narrative significance. The theme of perception-as-reality achieves philosophical heft through sensory specificity in key passages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original use of concert tickets as dimensional canvases stands out, but "individually general" concept feels academically vague rather than emotionally honest. Emotional engagement relies on statement over demonstration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Technical competence in element integration exists, but thematic weight feels inconsistently distributed. Some elements (doodles, timeframe) seem arbitrarily assigned rather than organically necessary to the philosophical thesis.</comment>
