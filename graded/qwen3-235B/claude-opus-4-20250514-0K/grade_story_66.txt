<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (breaking the cycle, seeking belonging) are clear but underdeveloped beyond ideation; actions align with themes yet lack personal specificity, relying on symbolic resonance over psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic acts (reconstructing masks, writing on walls) but lacks traditional tension/resolution; coherence exists despite fragmented chronology, though momentum is subdued within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting’s charred laboratory and plant-communication study amplify dissonance between nature’s potential and human violence; precise sensory details enhance immersion, though some metaphors threaten to overwhelm cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (masks, carbonized aggression) deepen thematic resonance; ending resonates with layered complexity about quiet resistance; avoids sentimentality while prompting reflection about moral courage and societal cycles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through unique plant-based weaponry subversion and philosophical focus; style is distinctive yet purposeful. Occasional lyrical density risks obscurity but generally serves thematic richness over indulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesion among elements is strong despite ambitious thematic scope; constrained form feels intentional. Lingering conceptual weight suggests literary merit, though emotional immediacy occasionally falters against abstract tone.</comment>
