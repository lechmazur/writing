<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's role as a sound engineer informs her skills but lacks emotional depth beyond revenge; her motivation is clear but insufficiently nuanced to justify the extreme actions taken.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has logical progression and a clear arc, but the rapid conclusion leaves the protagonist's long-term consequences unexplored, weakening the arc's emotional payoff within constrained word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "grimy windows" and "cold air" alongside the hybrid alchemical/sound-engineering setting create a rich, memorable atmosphere that enhances both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory metaphors (e.g., silence as a "terrible symphony") and the stained glass's projected visions add symbolic weight; the ending's thematic punch lingers, though some emotional beats rely on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original blending of sound engineering and magic avoids outright clich√©s, but the mob's swift moral epiphany feels contrived, leaning on oversimplified reactions to heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>All elements cohere without extraneous details, but the brevity occasionally sacrifices nuanced character psychology and broader implications of her powers, leaving the ending slightly hollow.</comment>
