<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear through decades of deception driven by guilt. Reveal of paternal confession to daughter is emotionally resonant. "Despairing cheer" establishes strong narrative voice, though supporting characters remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing maintains tension through parallel threads (water tower measurement/hospital call). Echo-based resolution is scientifically plausible yet dramatically satisfying. Final revelation about mother's awareness creates thematic symmetry but slightly undermines narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Radio wave garden could be more integrated with woodsman profession - electromagnetic elements feel juxtaposed rather than unified. Abandoned water tower works effectively as location-based time capsule. Sensory details like rain on beard and crackling radio link physical/emotional worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Emotional arc reaches catharsis through spatial-temporal convergence of railway discovery and maternal death. Hospital monitor's final beep mirrored in electromagnetic pulses demonstrates structural elegance. Subtext about archival legacy vs familial duty enriches narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radio wave garden avoids obvious sci-fi tropes while maintaining plausible science. Hairbrush as heirloom avoids maudlin sentimentality through restrained application. Emotional beats derive from relational geometry rather than direct exposition. Minimal mechanical phrasing detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around duality of revealed spaces - subterranean railway vs celestial radio waves. Conceptual framework of mapping as both geographical and psychological act remains consistent. Brief form compresses narrative without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
