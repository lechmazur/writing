<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's artistic sensitivity and courage are clear but her backstory lacks psychological complexity; motivations rooted in artistic discovery feel plausible but aren't fully interrogated beyond the surface level of "creative yearning." </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc from discovery to transcendence maintains logical cause-effect chains through tactile revelations; pacing compresses emotional weight effectively despite tight word limits, though the final transformation feels slightly rushed. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting combines hard SF and poetic abstraction through specific details like "bioluminescent veins" and "recycled air"; atmosphere achieves immersive coherence through sensory contrasts between sterile metal and living crystalline forms. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("crystallized dreams") and symbolic layering of art/transcendence create resonant thematic closure; subtext about creation requiring vulnerability elevates surface-level wonder with philosophical weight. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of stagecraft, space exploration, and artistic philosophy avoids genre clich√©s despite occasional borderline purple prose; emotional beats feel earned rather than stated, though the "rebellious artist" trope receives minimal deconstruction. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interwoven elements create cumulative emotional momentum; ending achieves thematic payoff through transformed understanding of "intimate separation"; stylistic choices enhance rather than obscure narrative intent despite high poetic density.</comment>
