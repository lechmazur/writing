<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's vigils and use of the seal are compelling, but motivations lack deep exploration beyond grief-as-justification; dialogue hints at complexity but doesn't fully realize it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot efficiently uses the word limit but relies on abrupt revelations (e.g., "micro-perforations") that strain cause-effect logic; coherence maintained but feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Effective visual contrast (peacock logo vs. harsh facility lights) but sparse sensory detail beyond sight; setting's scientific/industrial elements underutilized for atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of peacock patterns and seal-as-fingerprint; dialogue carries thematic weight; ending resonates thematically but emotional impact constrained by brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in merging mathematical patterns with conspiracy; some phrasing ("network of grieving farmers") borders on dramatic simplification; generally fresh approach to corporate thriller tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Compelling premise and tight logic bind assigned elements; lacks transcendent emotional depth or stylistic uniqueness required for top-tier distinction despite clever structure.</comment>
