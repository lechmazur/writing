<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but underdeveloped; motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally thin, relying on poetic abstraction over tangible emotional stakes. The 'independence/dependence' duality is present but lacks nuanced psychological exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic arc with clear beginning/ending, but tight word limits create slight narrative compression—some action-to-consequence transitions blur. Internal consistency maintained, though pacing feels dictated by poetic imperative rather than organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ravishing sensory immersion through impossible moonlight and tangible melancholy. The subconscious realm/carnival fusion creates potent atmosphere, though the setting occasionally overwhelms narrative functionality of specific locations within the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional command of literary devices—'dooms prevented by their own unmaking' contains profound philosophical weight. The paradoxical ending encapsulates the theme of erasure-as-creation, though emotional impact is more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Near-flawless originality in blending surreal mythology with temporal ethics. Avoids AI pitfalls through consistently idiosyncratic metaphors ('DNA of every choice,' 'bottled moments'). Only occasional risk of ornamental prose distracts from emotional substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration remarkably cohesive despite surreal density. The carnival-as-temporal-battleground concept and perfume bottle-as-MacGuffin work in harmony, with only minor elements (halos of regret) feeling conceptually indulgent rather than narratively essential.</comment>
