<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character voices are distinct, but motivations lack sufficient depth; Marcus's dry wit and duty-bound persona contrast with his eventual self-realization, but his emotional arc remains underdeveloped despite strong dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear ritualistic confrontation, but the connection between the dance and Elara's eroded promises feels conceptually compressed; certain reveals (e.g., Marcus's name) could benefit from earlier foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting details (salt, lighthouse) surface but lack layered atmospheric engagement; the "haunted" bedroom's physicality and temporal context remain frustratingly vague despite vivid potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Mastery of symbolic interplay between erosion, promises, and dance creates profound thematic resonance; the final twist's emotional weight and metaphorical precision elevate the narrative to transcendent levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting spectral tropes through maritime ritualism; avoids sentimentality via precise, evocative language; the rope's tactile deterioration as thematic anchor demonstrates exceptional conceptual rigor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Uneven integration of required elementsâ€”while the dance/betrayal framework works, foundational components like "haunted bedroom" and "traditional methods" feel perfunctorily implemented rather than organically central.</comment>
