<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Marina's mild curiosity lacks nuanced motivation; her reactions feel predetermined rather than organically human. Emotional responses to cosmic implications lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on intricate coincidences but sacrifices narrative momentum for lyrical abstraction. The rain pattern method strains credibility; temporal leaps feel rushed despite poetic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ship graveyard and storm atmosphere create haunting sensory immersion through resonant hull sounds, fractal rains, and decaying wood textures that mirror cosmic themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "derelict vessels as constellation") create memorable cosmic intimacy. Ending resonates thematically but lacks tensionâ€”more awe than emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phrases like "neural pathways in wood" risk overwrought metaphor. Excessive adjectives ("barnacle-crusted", "pearl-encrusted") verge on self-indulgent prose despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as conceptual poetry rather than plot-driven narrative. Atmospheric beauty outweighs character depth, with elements feeling conceptually rather than emotionally integrated.</comment>
