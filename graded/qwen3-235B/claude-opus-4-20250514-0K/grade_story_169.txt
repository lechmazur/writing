<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s role as soul-broker justifies his expertise in soul-reading, but his centuries-long arc lacks emotional resonance; gestures toward depth but underdevelops personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot fulfills transactional narrative arc but compresses emotional weight; the sale feels too facile, undercutting the “haunting” atmosphere’s potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ethereal worldbuilding is vivid through synesthetic details (static dust, "steam mixing with harmonies") but "recycling" period remains conceptually vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (songs as emotional keys, souls as estates) deepen themes; aria-seller’s trembling essence “showing” persuasion better than Marcus’s didactic quoting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with inverted labels/musical persuasion, but "weirdly static" dust borders on affectation and some phrases ("profound art of persuasion") verge on rote elegance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements serve the sales-magic conceit cohesively, though pacing leans on familiar "haunted artifact" tropes; lingers via questions about what souls lose/gain in rebirth.</comment>
