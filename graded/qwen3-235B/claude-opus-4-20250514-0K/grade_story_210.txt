<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is distinct but lacks emotional depth; motivations stated more than shown, though final choice demonstrates thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within constraints but resolution feels compressed; crossword-to-portal transition lacks gradual buildup despite clever symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through kinetic descriptions (vibrating timbers, autonomous shadows) but setting specificity (signal room mechanics) could be stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical depth (crossword/shadow navigation, lighthouse as dimensional anchor) elevates storytelling; some tell-dominant emotional beats reduce impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s while deploying familiar tropes (scholar-discovering-portal) with thematic subversion; language remains restrained but occasionally leans on "whispers" conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central theme but feel more stitched than organic; timbre/timbers wordplay and "doubly singular" explanation are less seamlessly integrated.</comment>
