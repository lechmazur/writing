<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh concept avoids genre tropes; no major flow issues; some over-familiar phrases like 'weathered hands'; emotional states shown through actions but deeper psychology remains elusive</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through strong central metaphor; elements serve mood over plot; style supports contemplative pacing; originality evident but emotional punch remains understated</comment>
