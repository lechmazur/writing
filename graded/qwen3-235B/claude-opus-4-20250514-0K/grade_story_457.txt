<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character’s assigned attribute (urban hermit) informs his isolation and side hustle, but inner contradictions feel underdeveloped; motivation for "forging paths toward solitude" is clear but lacks emotional depth or vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight transactional arc, but the shift from transaction to Ezra’s covert mission feels underexplored; pacing is efficient, though the resolution’s thematic resonance is undercut by abrupt thematic summary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nebula’s eerie vibrancy and Ezra’s claustrophobic habitat create a vivid, philosophically charged atmosphere; timeframe phrasing (“hush of unspoken promises”) is evocative but underused as plot driver.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of manufactured spontaneity critiques conformity with layered irony; the ending’s thematic punch is undercut by Ezra’s near-clichéd status as a lone rebel, but subtextual richness elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending myth and tech subversion thrives: zipper pull as symbol, folklore-as-dissent, and “impersonally personal” algorithms feel inventive. Rare moments of formal complexity verge on ornate abstraction, but mostly serve thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive critique of artificial connection; the brevity sharpens focus, though Ezra’s character occasionally feels more like a vehicle for ideas than a fully realized persona. Lingering thematic resonance is strong.</comment>
