<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve culture is clear but thinly nuanced; "trustworthy strange" lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through clear, compact beats but lacks narrative complexity; catapult device feels under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere with strong sensory contrasts; some details verge on overwrought ("borrowed dawn" risks poetic self-indulgence).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (thread as cultural DNA) resonate; subtext about memory resists cloying exposition; emotional depth implied rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes; atomic lighthouse and data-encoded fabric feel conceptually fresh; occasional ornateness ("fierce as fusion") doesn't derail impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive interplay between themes and elements; short form complements meditative tone; lingering questions about erased empire's ethics would strengthen engagement.</comment>
