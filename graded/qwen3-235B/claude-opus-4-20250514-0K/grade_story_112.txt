<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's aimlessness is established but lacks depth; motivations align with actions but emotional resonance thin; transformation feels abrupt despite key revelations; voice is consistent yet understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tight pacing suits word count; plot progression through discovery is logical; hopscotch decoding feels slightly convenient but resolves neatly; thematic continuity from aimlessness to purpose is satisfying despite brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lynching sensory details (dust, snow, chalk) immerse effectively; setting as archive mirrors thematic concerns; timeframes (1952, present) enrich context; tone balances solemnity and hope; could explore Lakota-specific atmosphere more.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (seeds of vigilance, handkerchief as inheritance) resonate; cyclical structure reinforces theme; ending achieves thematic cohesion; subtext about collective memory elevates narrative; emotional impact is understated yet poignant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés beyond "wise elder" trope; sensory detail specific but occasionally overdetermined (e.g., "children's games" as code); language remains clear without excess ornamentation; emotional beats rely somewhat on exposition but use personal connections to deepen impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically—handkerchief ties personal/collective threads; hopscotch puzzle drives plot; themes emerge organically; ending lingers thematically beyond immediate narrative scope.</comment>
