<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's impassive trait is consistent but underexplored; motivation to follow the twist tie lacks psychological depth, though reactions to supernatural elements align with the "impersonal" attribute. Inner life feels abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear progression but relies on abstract revelations over causal momentum. The twist tie's guidance and bee language are abstract drivers that strain logical flow despite poetic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Surreal cathedral atmosphere is vividly rendered (thorns, bees, glowing apples) but the "oil change" timeframe and gravity-defying roots feel jarring, undercutting immersive logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphor (bees as interpreters of reality, apples as bridges) and subtext about emotional detachment. Ending resonates thematically, though introspection occasionally veers into abstraction over immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in merging bureaucratic mundanity with cosmic surrealism. Sensory details are specific and purposeful; emotional resonance emerges through symbolic weight rather than explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified meditation on perception and legacy. Tight prose weaves multiple prompts into a mythic vignette, though the timeframe element disrupts otherwise seamless integration.</comment>
