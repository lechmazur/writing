<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's dejection is stated more than demonstrated; silent vow remains abstract without concrete emotional beats. Transformation lacks nuanced development despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on mystical movement through forgotten paths, but the arc's mystical convergence feels rushed and conceptually vague despite evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystalline walls and zero-gravity dance hall create a distinctive atmosphere, but the "sacred disorder" struggles to fully integrate with emotional undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery (dancers as constellations, trident as beacon) elevates the story, but the ending leans too heavily on abstract phrases rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Striking lines ("time flowed sideways") contrast with formulaic descriptors ("beacon of purpose"). Overreliance on elaborate metaphors obscures character depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements often exist independently rather than synergizing. The brevity exposes underdeveloped connections between the knight's vow and the setting's fantastical aspects.</comment>
