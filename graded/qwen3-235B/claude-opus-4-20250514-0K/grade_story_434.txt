<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's role as guardian is clear, but internal conflicts and personal stakes remain underexplored despite strong atmospheric integration of his curse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains tension between protagonist and visitor but lacks substantial escalation; the interaction feels like a single beat stretched thinly within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Absorbing, eerie atmosphere created through precise sensory details (e.g., napkin’s "impossible flames"), though some conceptual elements (zero-gravity flame) distract from grounded eeriness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (artifact as familial trauma) and haunting final lines elevate thematic impact; dialogue and metaphors ("capture smoke" as metaphor for lost legacies) resonate strongly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on familiar Gothic tropes (haunted carnival, lipstick-as-blood) without fully dismantling them; language remains stylish but controlled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Compelling central metaphor and eerie cohesion outweigh minor inconsistencies; brevity works for mood but undermines deeper exploration of themes.</comment>
