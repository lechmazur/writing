<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marla's "suspiciously trusting" trait drives key plot points (widow's keycard, guard's tip), but her internal motivations beyond "truth-seeking" lack depth. Her excitement about the candle's patterns reveals scientific passion but doesn't fully explore contradictions between her idealism and the lab's grim reality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear infiltration plot works within constraints, but the "excel" revelation feels abrupt. The candle's decoding is visually striking but lacks procedural logic—how a single burn pattern leads to full comprehension of dimensional warnings strains credibility. The final "future believers" vision feels telegraphed rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned mirror lab offers rich symbolism—reflections visually manifest her dual identity and the lab's fractured reality. Wind-blown autumn leaves provide practical alibi and atmospheric decay. The sensory details (cracked glass, char scent) immerse without overwhelming, though the interplay between fire's "truth" and the decayed environment remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weaves metaphorical layer (fire as truth, seeds as knowledge) into plot mechanics. The central image of "burn patterns as coordinates" merges mystery and science. Ending transcends genre tropes by framing conspiracy as collective hope rather than paranoia. Subtext about institutional silencing gains emotional weight through concrete details like discarded coffee cups as "evidence."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original take on cryptids avoids monster tropes, using them to explore interdimensional ethics. Resistance against institutional erasure feels fresh ("communities of care in disguise"). Avoids "lone genius" cliché by emphasizing collective action. Language remains vivid without descending into purple prose—though "leaves applaused" risks cuteness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Elements function cohesively—tray, mirrors, and candle interlock metaphorically. The 500-word limit enables haunting vignettes rather than feeling restrictive. Ending's thematic resonance (whispers becoming movement) justifies structure, though the leap from candle to "tomorrow" requires reader investment. Leaves lingering contemplation about how marginalized truths surface.</comment>
