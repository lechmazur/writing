<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's compassion and astral projection are central to her characterization, but the "sometimes always" motivation repeats the phrase, weakening its nuance. Actions align with established traits, but emotional depth could be more "shown" than "told."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from revelation to resolution, but the decoy consciousness trick feels contrived. Pacing works within constraints, yet the key's mechanics remain under-explained, slightly weakening cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The carnival's decayed rides and shadow metaphors establish strong atmosphere, but the setting's connection to the key's origins remains unexplored. Sensory details are effective but occasionally generic (e.g., "broken rides like dark fingers").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional weight comes through the boy's rescue and Maya's sacrifice. Subtext about compassion's risks is present but surface-level. Writing style balances descriptive language with action, though some "told" emotions detract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps but leans on "cursed artifact" tropes. "Sun shadows" technique feels forced. Language remains clear but occasionally overwrites ("dark fingers," "echoes of her presence"). Compassion motivation lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists at surface level, but deeper thematic integration (e.g., how astral projection reflects her inner conflict) is missing. Plot-device elements dominate over emotional resonance.</comment>
