<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Erasmus's cynical yet mathematically devout persona is sharply drawn, but Celeste's characterization leans on archetypal melancholy. Their mutual isolation is thematic rather than deeply individualized, occasionally sacrificing nuance for metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Awakening the globe drives a coherent arc, but the compressed ending feels rushed—a century's weight diminished by rapid resolution. Cause/effect logic holds, but the narrow word count strains emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dusty brass, echoing voices, and the lighthouse's rotating beam create a tactile, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details like "tarnished" and "pulsing loneliness" deepen the sense of suspended time, though the setting occasionally verges on Gothic familiarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The story's emotional pivot—from solitary ambition to shared metaphysical connection—is poignant. Metaphors (e.g., "light from dead stars") resonate, and the ending's thematic payoff elevates the concept beyond conventional ghost tales, though dialogue occasionally falters toward poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by blending celestial mechanics with emotional vulnerability, but phrases like "terrible weight of being brilliant" flirt with melodrama. The humbly arrogant trait feels more functional than psychologically complex, and some descriptions (e.g., "sad and beautiful laughter") edge toward formulaic lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Crystalline integration of elements (the globe as both prison and bridge) demonstrates authorial control. The lighthouse-as-metaphor never feels forced, though the century-spanning timeframe requires narrative leaps that slightly disrupt intimacy.</grade>
