<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-defined motivation with sassy defiance, but internal conflict depth limited by word count. Academically mischievous trait underdeveloped despite camera's role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear three-act compression with fracture action as climax. Pacing suffers slightly from rushed containment breach resolution. Some logical jumps between chest openings.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually distinctive atmosphere through impossible sensory details (shifting hieroglyphs, gravity hiccups). Twilight timing symbolizes transition between order and chaos with minor tonal dissonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Creative element integration with minor tonal inconsistencies. Story structure prioritizes spectacle over thematic payoff. Memorable imagery lingers more than character resolution.</comment>
