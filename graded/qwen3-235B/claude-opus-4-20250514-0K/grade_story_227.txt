<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character traits are present but thinly rendered; perseverance is shown through methodical actions but lacks nuanced internal conflict or multifaceted depth that would make Marcus feel human rather than symbolic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an arc of discovery and realization but sacrifices tension through static pacing; the eternal countdown's thematic role is clear but its structural integration feels more atmospheric than dramatic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are exquisitely rendered with sensory details (cracked vinyl, fractured light) but tonal consistency wavers briefly between mystical and scientific.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., revolution as a shift in perception) and imagery (clock-hand cages) offer rich subtext; ending resonates thematically with cyclical tension; prose balances poeticism with precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original concept (science-mysticism synthesis) avoids trope repetition; some phrases ("ascend through skylights") flirt with abstraction but overall avoids formulaic transitions or inconsistent logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements are organically interwoven; brevity enhances thematic focus; intellectual resonance outweighs emotional immediacy but remains conceptually cohesive.</comment>
