<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation and self-awareness; reactions to objects reveal character, but dialogue and distinction between internal monologue vs personality could be stronger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear arc within word limit with logical cause-effect progression, but pacing drags in metaphysical middle section while earlier protest setup doesn't fully pay off narratively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Haunted setting effectively contrasts with modern brewing world; specific sensory details thin beyond visual elements, but protest sounds provide useful texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uses decent metaphors like mirror's shifting reflections, but emotional impact remains surface-level with predictable philosophical depth rather than challenging reader expectations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some trope awareness with "hipster peddling liquid pretension" but relies on well-worn archetypes (dissatisfied artisan, haunted cellar) without meaningful subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements function but lack cohesion - protest context and mirror symbolism could integrate more tightly with character transformation arc for stronger thematic resonance.</comment>
