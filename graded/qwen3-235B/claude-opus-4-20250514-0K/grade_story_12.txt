<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters' aloofness and motivations are implied through action and dialogue, but their internal conflicts remain underexplored. The sisters' dynamic is established, but emotional stakes lack full development within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure with thematic connection between beginning and end, but the narrative progression relies heavily on exposition. Pacing balances past/present, though key revelations feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>World-building is atmospheric but superficialâ€”holographic rivers and futurism lack sufficient integration with core themes. Sensory details suggest a contrast between past and present but need more specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic use of metaphor (tiles as memory, mapping as emotional distance) elevates the narrative. Ending resonates thematically, though some imagery (e.g., "growth rings") verges on over-obviousness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts expected tropes about memory and sibling estrangement. Language is purposeful, with fresh metaphors connecting cartography to emotional repression. Some transitional phrases strain toward poeticism but avoid outright purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements like the tile and mall are tightly integrated, but kayaking simulation feels more mechanical than thematic. The story succeeds in thematic layering despite occasional underdeveloped aspects.</comment>
