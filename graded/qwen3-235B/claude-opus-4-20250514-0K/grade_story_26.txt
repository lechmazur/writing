<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated rather than dramatized; inner conflict lacks sufficient nuance. Voice blends general angst with technical exposition, diluting personal specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc, but the DNA revelation feels abrupt; some cause-effect leaps in execution. Pacing balances tension and resolution but sacrifices emotional depth for concept.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory overload (neon, data streams, resonance) creates immersive cyberpunk ecology. Setting and atmosphere synergize to amplify both plot and thematic paradox of connection/isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (orchard as neural web, bell as consciousness bridge) deepen subtext. The ending's "infinite symphony" theme resonates through layered symbolism, though transformation could be less abstractly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some cyberpunk tropes (erased geniuses, consciousness transcendence) undercut freshness. Descriptions occasionally prioritize ornate abstraction over precise emotional clarity (e.g., "splinter and merge" lacks bodily specificity).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Idea-rich but unevenly realized; integrates elements logically yet leaves thematic threads underexplored. The ending's beauty contrasts with earlier clinical tone, raising questions about stylistic cohesion.</comment>
