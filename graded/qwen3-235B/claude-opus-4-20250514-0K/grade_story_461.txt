<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is linear and coherent, but the resolution feels rushed—pacing stumbles slightly in balancing exposition with emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through specific sensory details (lavender, spell-laden shelves), but the setting’s connection to the theme could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance and symbolic depth elevate the narrative; the theme of inherited trauma and reconciliation is conveyed with nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls (witch subverts resurrection trope) but occasionally leans on familiar emotional beats; prose is purposeful yet occasionally veers into slight over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements, though some feel more essential than others; ending provides thematic closure but lacks lingering ambiguity for deeper reflection.</comment>
