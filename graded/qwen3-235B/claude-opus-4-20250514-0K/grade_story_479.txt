<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation to uncover family tradition is clear and drives action, but interiority remains stylized over deeply felt; voice aligns with glamorous persona but lacks nuanced contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacing within tight word count is remarkably controlled; plot arc from MySpace discovery to ritual execution feels complete, though some transitions between memory and present action could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Contrasts between funeral home grimness and vibrant paint mixing create haunting atmosphere; sensory details like the retracted tape's "click" and metallic paint rhythms masterfully conflate mourning with creativity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphorical death-as-canvas approach; subtext about measuring unrealized potential elevates the narrative beyond literal plot, with some purple prose undercutting impact slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through audacious fusion of analog tradition (circus history) with digital ephemera; emotional subtext in ritual practice feels human, though MySpace archive conceit risks feeling algorithmically quirky rather than organically invented.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of disparate elements; story structure feels purposeful despite brevity, though ending's declaration about "ordinary undertaking" strains toward profoundness slightly beyond its grasp.</comment>
