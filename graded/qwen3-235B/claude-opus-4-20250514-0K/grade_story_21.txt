<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rationale: Character's cold precision and calculated revenge are well-established through tactile details and dialogue, but motivations lack depth beyond surface vengeance. Inner conflict remains underexplored despite strong external actions indicating transformation. The tassel as object-to-motivation connection works, but voice occasionally veers toward arch literary stylization rather than distinct characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rationale: Tight three-act structure within constraints showcases efficient movement from ambush to climax. Cause-effect relationship between genetic research and neurotoxin payoff is logical. Slight pacing hiccups in exposition delivery, though rhythmic drumming motif threads through effectively. Resolution feels inevitable yet satisfying within scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rationale: Atmospheric details like must-soaked theater, tactile marble corridors, and relentless drumbeat sensory repetition create visceral decay. Setting-as-character quality in forgotten city hall enhances thematic decay of order. Some elements (drum circles) feel vaguely symbolic rather than organically integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rationale: Metaphors of transformation (fox tail's "writhe," neurotoxin as "patterns") elevate concept. Emotional subtext of compromised morality emerges through minimalist dialogue. Ending's thematic weight about identity loss resonates. Some "telling" via phrases like "price of revenge" slightly undercut show-don't-tell principle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rationale: Avoids revenge trope clichés through biotech twist, but language occasionally lapses into elaborate descriptors ("compartmentalization," "synthetic-organic properties"). Subtext about truth's cost in diplomacy shows ingenuity. Some atmospheric elements verge on overwrought while maintaining distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rationale: Element integration shows skilled calibration—genetic research drives plot, tassel serves dual role as weapon and symbol. Short form constraints create tension without feeling artificial. Lingering themes (identity dissolution) elevate beyond revenge-as-plot. Occasional conceptual abstraction distances engagement.</comment>
