<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but lack deeper exploration; restlessness drives action but inner conflicts remain underdeveloped. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with thematic cohesion, but pacing falters in middle—events feel compressed, tension between cancellation and dive needs more gradual unfolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting immerses with vivid details—acoustic distortions, phosphorescent plankton—and evokes mood inseparably from themes. Cave becomes metaphorical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (“absence of light forming words”) and subtext about surrender vs. control resonate deeply. Ending satisfies thematically but over-explains with final line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but contains vague abstractions (“complexly simple”) and occasional overreliance on familiar “teacher’s wisdom” motifs without sufficient subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements blend effectively, though administrator’s abrupt shift from transactional to reverent strains credibility. Concision prioritizes poetry over emotional nuance.</comment>
