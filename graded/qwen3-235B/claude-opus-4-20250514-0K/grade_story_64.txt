<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation for preserving maps ties weakly to immortality theme; character's decisive action resolves arc but lacks emotional depth in her transition from trembling doubt to resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Verdict-driven plot creates tension, but the compressed arc between discovery and exile feels hurried; immortality's cost as theme drives structure but pacing uneven in middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details anchor the whimsical setting (whispers, iridescent scales) but the floating marketplace’s connection to the core conflict is decorative rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (scuffed marble as coded legacy, cracked scale as flawed eternity) elevate thematic resonance; ending’s thematic symmetry is poignant and layered, though not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery (“trees in perfect spirals,” “whispers in bottles”) avoids cliché, but “technically wild hope” and moral clarity feel formulaic; tone avoids purple prose but lacks distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements are deftly woven into a melancholic meditation on mortality; weaker cohesion with temporal framing and “mundane miracles” tone dilute thematic focus.</comment>
