<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chen's motivation as a seeker of reconciliation is clear and evolves through specific interactions, but her transformation feels somewhat passive/external rather than deeply interrogated. The coathanger as symbolic tool works well but lacks visceral connection to her personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Episodic structure via weekly picnics creates cohesion through repetition but risks diluting tension. The debris strike incident provides effective pacing contrast, yet the arc relies heavily on thematic resolution rather than narrative consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Recycled air rustling postcards, bent coathanger as compass/bridge, and orbital fragility create immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like tactile refrigerator surfaces ground the existential themes, making 'memory as debris field' viscerally tangible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of elliptical healing orbits as both narrative structure and thematic argument resonates deeply. The final report's simplicity juxtaposed with cosmic scale elevates the subtext, while the coathanger's transformation into 'hope' avoids trite resolution through understated execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through metaphoric layering; postcards-as-memorials and debris-as-history feel fresh. Emotional beats emerge through physical objects rather than exposition, though 'branches of redemption' risks slight abstraction without more ecological context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements (picnics, coathanger, postcard rituals) organically serve theme rather than appear assigned. The brevity feels intentional, compressing years into meals while the pinned cards' evolving significance lingers as structural backbone. Slight tonal unevenness between lyrical passages and exposition weakens perfection.</comment>
