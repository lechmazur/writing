<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marisol is consistent in her feisty pride and determination, but her deeper motivations remain surface-level, relying on brief mentions of Father Eduardo's legacy rather than fully realized emotional stakes or personal vulnerabilities.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum is brisk and coherent, but the tight word limit leaves the severed bridges' significance underexplored. The exorcism climax is satisfying, though the resolution feels slightly telegraphed rather than organically earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treehouse metropolis and magical time hiccup create an immersive, whimsical atmosphere that complements the playful-cynical tone. Sensory details (grimoire's sticky cover, banana-leaf shutters) enhance authenticity, though the setting's deeper sociopolitical implications remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bright, vivid dialogue and Marisol's darkly humorous voice anchor the narrative's impact. The grimoire-as-character and cyclical crises inject thematic layers about power's banality, though the ending slightly undercuts its own subversive potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding (magic-growing-on-trees, tourist routes through wizard enclaves) elevates it above clich√©. Some phrasing ("banished yesterday's demon") veers toward mechanical brevity, but the central conceit feels genuinely distinctive within speculative fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</degree><comment>Elements like the grimoire's sticky horror and time's "hiccups" create momentum rather than feeling forced. The story's economy of scale works as a deliberate choice, ending on a sharp thematic beat about duty's transactional nature.</comment>
