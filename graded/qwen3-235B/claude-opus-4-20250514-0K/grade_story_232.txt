<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the protagonist's dual identity as doctor/archaeologist creates initial intrigue, emotional motivations feel more telegraphed than authentically dramatized. Her transformation lacks gradual psychological nuance despite clear narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plot follows a logical trajectory from exhaustion to revelation, but compression flattens cause-effect logic between mundane camp details and monumental discoveries. The coffee-grounds-to-treasure pacing feels rushed rather than inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric flourishes like "pewter line" horizons exist, but the digital nomad camp feels like generic backdrop rather than culturally specific pressure-cooker. The temple remains more conceptual than sensorially real, and "dire enchantment" gets stated more than embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptual interplay between medicine/archaeology offers thematic richness, and the "showing" through glyphs is strong. However, emotional resonance remains surface-level - the ending feels intellectually satisfying rather than viscerally impactful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While avoiding overt tropes, the coffee-ground epiphany borders on magical thinking rather than organic deduction. Emotion telegraphing ("hands trembled") dominates over complex character interiority. The central idea shines while the execution shows AI-like shortcuts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ideas resonate beyond the page, particularly about knowledge transmission across eras. However, the narrative architecture feels more like a scaffolding for concepts than a unified artistic expression that would distinguish itself in a competitive literary landscape.</comment>
