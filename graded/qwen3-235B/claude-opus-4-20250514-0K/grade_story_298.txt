<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wei's 'rationally impulsive' trait occasionally feels tacked on rather than organically shaping his decisions. While his grief becomes tangible, his psychological duality lacks sufficient exploration to fully justify the character's central role in solving the mystery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from dress examination to discovery with economy, though the director's motive is underdeveloped. The cyclical structure—from initial investigation to the promise of theatrical resolution—works within tight constraints, with cause-effect logic mostly intact despite the abrupt villain reveal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-oil aesthetic shines through precise details: solar panels on pagodas, renewable-era embalming of garments. Sensory immersion is vivid, particularly in the dress's jasmine-fear contrast and the collapsing weight of the child-sized costume against adult trauma.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (burning past for fuel vs. preserving truth) and the ghostly performance motif elevate this beyond a mystery. The final juxtaposition of audience tears—with ambiguous causes—invites deeper reflection on historical amnesia and performative empathy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While metaphors like "dust motes that danced like tiny ghosts" are fresh, some phrases ("anxious serenity") border on aestheticized abstraction. The 'actor-investigator' approach shows ingenuity, but the villain's motive leans on familiar 'jealous artist' tropes without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting meditation on memory and reinvention. The brevity serves as a strength, prioritizing symbolic resonance over exhaustive explanation. Tension emerges less from the mystery itself than from Wei's precarious emotional balance.</comment>
