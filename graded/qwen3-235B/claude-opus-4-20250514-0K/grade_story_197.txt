<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marla’s transformation from con artist to cosmic conductor is emotionally resonant, but her internal shifts feel slightly too rapid, lacking nuanced exploration of her psychological layers beyond surface-level revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Structure is tightly condensed yet cohesive, with the fabric’s pull driving momentum. Minor pacing issues arise in the transition to deciphering sticky notes, but the circular connection between mundane horror and cosmic resolution satisfies the arc’s brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral, otherworldly setting fused with intimate domestic remnants creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (weeping bark, humming fabric) immerse readers, though the cosmic scale occasionally strains logical spatial cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Story masterfully weaves metaphor and subtext, particularly the recontextualization of maternal ephemera into cosmic truth. Emotional impact is heightened by contrasts—mundane/profound, horror/beauty—though some poetic flourishes border on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid originality in merging cosmic and domestic subverts expectations. Avoids cliché but occasionally falters into ornate descriptions (“bark that wept starlight”) that prioritize style over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Despite ambitious scope, the narrative synthesizes assigned elements into a unified, thematic whole. Leaves lingering resonance about love’s cosmic scale, though minor tonal dissonance arises from abrupt shifts between horror and tenderness.</comment>
