<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character traits and motivations are underdeveloped; the "wayward apothecary" lacks depth, and their actions show little connection to the assigned attribute "unjustly fair." Motivation to track butterflies feels arbitrary rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Poorly paced due to conflicting elements; the action ("infect") and method ("Morse code") lack logical progression, resulting in a disjointed arc. The beginning and end are disconnected, undermining cohesion within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is underutilized, offering no sensory immersion. The timeframe "between broken treaties" fails to influence atmosphere, and the tone "battered marvel" is inconsistently applied, creating a flat, generic world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Lacks emotional resonance or subtext. Dialogue (if present) is mechanical, and literary devices are absent. The ending feels arbitrary, with no clear theme or tension. Relies heavily on "telling" emotions rather than showing through action or detail.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>Riddled with clich√©s and mechanical writing. Overly precise but generic descriptors (e.g., "dry highlighter pen") lack specificity. Subtext and emotional nuance are missing, relying on surface-level tropes typical of formulaic AI generation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Elements feel forced and unrelated, suggesting a checklist approach. Plot twists are absent, and the story shows no ingenuity in combining assigned components. No lingering impact or thematic depth is evident.</comment>
