<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional grounding; motivations are implied more than dramatized through nuanced conflict or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherent but episodic structure; the central metaphor sustains momentum but key connections between fairy tale logic and meteorological revelation feel conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative and cohesive - the juxtaposition of storm-chasing technology with ancient monastery architecture creates fertile tension between science and myth; sensory details are poetically precise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Profound thematic synergy between forgotten languages, storytelling patterns, and meteorological cycles; metaphors resonate on multiple symbolic levels; ending achieves conceptual closure through implied paradigm shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of meteorology and mythography avoids clich√©s; some ornate phrasing risks preciousness but most stylistic choices serve to externalize the protagonist's idiosyncratic cognition.</comment>
