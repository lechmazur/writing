<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a puzzle-maker burdened by guilt is implied but underdeveloped; her "optimistic bitterness" exists as a label without nuanced psychological exploration, though the symbolic objects do compellingly externalize her internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative movement from receipt of letters to the climactic lighthouse activation is logically structured, but the word count compression leaves the 40-day progression feeling telescoped rather than organically earned, creating rhythmic unevenness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like the compass' trembling needle and salt-burned crate effectively evoke maritime isolation, but the lighthouse setting remains more symbolic than visceral, with weather patterns and physical space under-depicted despite strong atmospheric undertones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is rich in metaphorical layering (string constellations as spiritual maps, inward-pointing compasses) with haunting final line, though the abstract emotional terrain occasionally risks overshadowing character specificity for visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasional overreliance on familiar symbolic objects (self-reflective mirror, truth-revealing bell) edges toward conceptual trope recycling; phrases like "spiritual cartography" occasionally veer into portentous abstraction rather than earned metaphoric resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements achieve remarkable thematic cohesion—puzzle-making translates to self-interrogation, packages create narrative momentum—though the brevity necessitates sacrificing deeper exploration of Elara's past moral failures while maintaining stylistic excellence.</comment>
