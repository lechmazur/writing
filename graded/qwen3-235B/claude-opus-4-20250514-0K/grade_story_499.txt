<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation for reclaiming her stolen voice is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of her internal struggles. The "poetically rational" attribute influences her decision-making but isn't deeply integrated into her character beyond linking apples to encoded secrets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is driven by Maya's quest but feels compressed in explaining the orchard's lore. The cause-effect between decoding journals and orchestrating the senator's downfall is logical, but the abrupt revelation about bioluminescent memory preservation strains coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with glowing fungus and twisted trees enhances the surreal tone. The underground orchard's atmosphere effectively mirrors the duality of clandestine power and natural decay, though the symphony hall's tuning remains underutilized atmospheric contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like stolen voices becoming fruit and corrupted journals evoking memory decay are powerful. The ending's satisfaction lies in the thematic symmetry between ghostwriting as hidden influence and biological memory preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with its bioluminescent orchard concept but contains minor purple prose ("orchestrated chaos"). Character motivation has logical consistency but lacks emotional subtext, relying partly on stated ambitions rather than psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements like ghostwriting and secret identities are tightly woven with the orchard's biological archive system. The fusion of political corruption, poetic code, and fungal preservation offers a distinctive speculative premise that lingers conceptually.</comment>
