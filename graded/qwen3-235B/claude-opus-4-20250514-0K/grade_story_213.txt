<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strength in Marcus's quiet conflict but Elena's motivations lack depth; his loyalty feels organic, hers feels narratively imposed. The clip as a connection between past and present is effective but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from revelation to climax but feels compressed. The vial's reveal is impactful, but the shift from lab to wedding isn't given enough thematic weight within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lab-turned-wedding venue creates rich juxtaposition. Sensory details (glowing vial, humming machinery) enhance mood. Atmosphere successfully bridges scientific sterile-ness with celebratory artifice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphor of photosynthesizing darkness is masterfully tied to thematic truths. Ending delivers emotional resonance through symbolic action rather than statement. The "impossible light" functions as both plot device and philosophical concept.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in reverse biology concept outweighs occasional mechanical phrasing ("primal force"). Avoids melodrama but contains slightly overwrought line about destroying darkness mistaken for day. Emotional nuance present but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements purposefully integrated with emotional logic. The scientific and existential layers create lingering resonance. The tight structure feels intentional rather than constrained, with theme of suppressed truth emerging organically.</comment>
