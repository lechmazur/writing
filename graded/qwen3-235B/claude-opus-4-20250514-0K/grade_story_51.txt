<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but emotional depth feels underdeveloped; Marcus' transition from thug to redemption-seeker needs more nuanced internal friction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc compressed effectively into the word limit; some pacing hiccups in the middle hinder full engagement with the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting serves thematic purpose well, particularly the static electricity garden as metaphor; could incorporate more tactile details for complete immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impressive use of symbolism (crate slat, charged garden) elevates the narrative; dialogue and metaphors feel earned, not forced, but thematic subtlety occasionally flattens.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of museum setting and criminal past avoids clich√©; prose is mostly lean and evocative, though a few polished phrases lack emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interwoven cohesively to explore redemption; brevity amplifies tension but leaves some character/setting potential unrealized.</comment>
