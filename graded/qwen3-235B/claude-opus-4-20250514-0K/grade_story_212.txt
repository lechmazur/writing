<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation to escape Council control, but emotional depth feels slightly schematic; transition from farmer to self-determined agent lacks nuanced internal conflict. The 'atypical mutations' as extensions of her suppressed identity is clever but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from oppression to escape, but the pivotal moment between ace card falling and the sentient plant guidance feels abrupt; pacing compresses key revelations into a brief span, diluting their emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ethereal plains, scorched glass, and bioluminescent crops create vivid sensory contrast; the 'song of boundaries' as both literal and metaphorical atmosphere works well, though maritime memories in an apocalyptic interior setting create minor tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (cards as genetic language, plants as rebellion) operate with elegant restraint; the transformation into a 'seed' rather than a farmer is conceptually rich. Ending lacks narrative stakes but gains thematic power through its symbolic finality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés in combining genetics and apocalypticism but veers into purple prose ("cell walls singing harmonies"); the mycelial network exodus feels fresh yet risks being a convenient sci-fi trope. Emotions emerge through action rather than stated sentiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually but occasionally strain under the word limit—maritime motifs clash with interior plains setting. The ending lingers thematically despite compressed character beats, suggesting depth that remains partially unrealized.</comment>
