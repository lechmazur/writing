<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has clear traits and growth, but motivations and emotions remain underexplored beneath surface descriptions. The connection between awkwardness and swordplay feels more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically within constraints, but key transitions feel compressed. The action’s execution lacks narrative weight due to the brevity, undercutting the resolution’s emotional potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with striking sensory details (steam, frost) that enhance both setting and concept. The world feels hauntingly cohesive, though its logic occasionally strains under deeper scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (hermit crabs, orchard renewal) add thematic depth. Subtext of cultural preservation through patience resonates effectively, though some imagery leans into abstraction over concrete impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and tone, but occasionally falters into poetic vagueness. Avoids major clichés but risks over-reliance on lyrical cadence over precise, idiosyncratic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Most elements interact meaningfully, though thematic threads occasionally pull ahead of narrative clarity. The ending suggests potential for deeper exploration lost to word constraints.</comment>
