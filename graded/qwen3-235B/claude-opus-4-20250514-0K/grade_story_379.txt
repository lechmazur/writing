<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s transformation is implied but lacks emotional resonance. The legal linguistics motif ties motivation to actions, but nuance in his internal conflict is sacrificed to exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arc is compressed but functional. The stretching-as-subterfuge concept drives the plot, though abrupt shifts (e.g., drone scene resolution) disrupt coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is lushly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescent crops, tonal climate systems) but occasionally strains plausibility (quantum drive in molar).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (language as crop cycles) and subtext (preservation vs. erasure). Ending resonates thematically but pacing stumbles on reflective moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh twists (linguistic coding in agriculture). Avoids clichés but some phrasing (e.g., "impatiently patient") feels artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually but uneven execution (e.g., rushed redemption arc, underdeveloped rivals) undermines cohesion.</comment>
