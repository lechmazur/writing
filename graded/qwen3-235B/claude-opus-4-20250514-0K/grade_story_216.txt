<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between past and present is underdeveloped; motivations (search for truth about Seminary's destruction) feel vaguely defined despite intriguing surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mid-story exposition disrupts momentum; circular structure (opening/closing with washer) satisfies but compressed arc feels slightly rushed, especially mystery context.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric processors and synthetic clouds create vivid, thematic backdrop, though cloud city's functionality rarely intersects with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with strong symbolic throughlines (washer as sacramental object) and subtextual critique of manufactured guilt, though occasionally tips toward self-conscious metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique concept blending but occasionally overrelies on "high-tech noir" stylistic defaults; sacred symbol decoding lacks sufficiently fresh execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Element integration mostly effective, though some (library card timeframe) remain superficially tied to narrative; pacing unevenness prevents higher score despite compelling thematic unity.</comment>
