<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's aristocratic desperation drives plot but lacks nuance beyond single-minded pursuit; internal conflict implied but not deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act progression within constraints, but pacing falters during ascent; sudden phantom coaster activation slightly disrupts trajectory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie liminality of setting masterfully rendered through specific details like spectral laughter and singing ladder rungs, making supernatural elements feel grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (orchids as memory, preserves as alchemy) elevate narrative; theme of legacy's duality resonates without being didactic. Some telling of emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original take on haunted spaces avoids clich√©s through synesthetic details; avoids formulaic expressions except slightly heavy-handed ladder melody symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically (orchids, ghostly mechanics, legacy theme) but minor components like "between parallel paths" underutilized; tone remains consistent.</comment>
