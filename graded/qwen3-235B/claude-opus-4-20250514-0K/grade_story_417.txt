<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (madness seeking truth through vulnerability) are consistent but development lacks nuance; his transformation feels abrupt and interiority leans on exaggerated gestures rather than layered psychological shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from obsession to realization, but the "unspoken agreements" concept drives events more than character agency; pacing uneven - drags in descriptions, rushes the climactic confession's consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Jungle-parlor juxtaposition creates striking sensory dissonance; decaying opulence mirrors Cornelius’s crumbling sanity. Atmosphere excels in immersion but occasionally overwhelms narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical layering (bottle cap as cosmic truth, Victorian/jungle juxtaposition) creates thought-provoking tension; ending balances absurdity with emotional weight through paradoxical imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but occasionally veers into self-indulgent descriptions ("phosphorescent fungi," "crystal chandelier dripping condensation"); subtext feels more constructed than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Highly cohesive - jungle parlor, unspoken agreements, and metaphysical bottle cap coalesce into unified philosophical fable; each element interrogates reality's fragility through dissonant juxtaposition.</grade>
