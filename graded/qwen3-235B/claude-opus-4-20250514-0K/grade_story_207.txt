<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in contrasting Petra’s forthright nature against Marcus’s broken humanity, but the "blood oath" backstory feels surface-level without deeper exploration of their shared history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot is tightly compressed but loses tension in the abrupt shift from confrontation to Marcus’s emotional unraveling; the core conflict resolves too conveniently.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere works for existential themes, but the abandoned medical bay relies on sterile tropes without unique sensory textures to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bouquet symbolizes memory and guilt effectively, and the dialogue avoids melodrama, but emotional beats (e.g., Marcus’s redemption) lean on implication too heavily.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subverts "reunion" clichés by emphasizing moral ambiguity, but the "secret song of the universe" risks poetic vagueness over fresh, grounded metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated, but the story’s brevity leaves its themes of justice and legacy underexplored, making the arc feel slight.</comment>
