<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Maya's apprehension is shown through subtle gestures but lacks deeper exploration of how her archer skills intersect with her emotional journey; motivation to "rescue truth" feels undernourished beyond surface-level rebellion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The descent through tech eras creates visual momentum, but pacing stumbles transitioning from festival backstory to data center climax; ending resolves too neatly given the existential stakes implied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neon-ancient juxtaposition works visually, but atmosphere becomes more thematic set piece than lived environment; "borrowed dawn" imagery lacks tangible connection to mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mechanics of reading carved server data as historical palimpsest offers clever metaphor, but exposition-heavy dialogue undermines thematic nuance; circular "preservation as flame" motif carries emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clich√©s through anachronistic details like the archers, yet wax-related sensory descriptions verge on purple prose; theme of compassion feels intellectually compelling but emotionally distant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements function thematically but strain narrative credibility (candle flam in sterile environment); cyberpunk scaffolding supports story scaffolding but lacks systemic critique or technological specificity to justify its presence.</comment>
