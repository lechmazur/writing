<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's streetwise background lacks specific actions demonstrating resourcefulness; motivation to harvest hope isn't fully integrated with past experiences; reactions to the brooch feel generic rather than revealing deeper vulnerability or survivalist logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot is propelled by a single clear action (using the brooch), but the compressed arc feels rushed; the resolution hinges on abstract concepts rather than earned emotional beats, creating a sense of poetic closure that lacks narrative gravitas.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but tonally inconsistent: juxtaposition of Gothic decay with sacred rebirth works, but sensory details sometimes overwhelm subtlety; pomegranate symbolism and temporal paradoxes deepen the atmosphere without over-explaining their relevance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "time as origami" and the ironic role of cynicism in revealing truth elevate it beyond surface fantasy; the ending resonates thematically but risks pretension through excessive lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inversion logic but occasionally succumbs to self-consciously poetic prose ("fruit falling upward"); the temporal mechanics are inventive, yet some descriptors ("glowed faintly") lack specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements function together but occasionally feel checklist-driven; the concise format works for conceptual impact but sacrifices emotional anchoring; intriguing questions about time remain underexplored in service to poetic closure.</comment>
