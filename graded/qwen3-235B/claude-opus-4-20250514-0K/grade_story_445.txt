<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Minimal backstory weakens emotional investment, though motivation (seeking Threshold) is clear and consistent. Nomad's transformation lacks earned nuance despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight pacing within constraints, but the arc relies heavily on exposition over lived-in plot progression. Some transitions (e.g., sudden understanding of Threshold) feel rushed rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (fluorescent light, bent metal) ground the mystical. Atmosphere aligns with theme, though secret agent disguise room's backstory feels underexplored and inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (barbells as bridges, mirror of intentions) are striking. Thematic resonance of surrender vs. force lingers, though emotional beats between characters remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh twist on "bridging realms" avoids genre tropes. Avoids purple prose but occasionally slips into didacticism. Unique voice present but inconsistent in quieter moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but often feel compartmentalized. Premise is intriguing, but brevity sacrifices deeper character/setting exploration that could elevate it to publishable perfection.</comment>
