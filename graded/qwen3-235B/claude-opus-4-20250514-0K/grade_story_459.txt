<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to understand her “burden of sight” is clear, though her transition from curiosity to enlightenment feels slightly rushed. Her dual role as technician and spectral liberator aligns with her analytical yet empathetic approach, but her internal conflict lacks deeper layering. The “voice” in third-person is lyrical but less distinct than a first-person angle might have allowed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacing is taut and purposeful, with the disintegration of the flower crown serving as a plot linchpin. The beginning (trembling fingers) and end (silence “singing with possibility”) are tightly connected through the theme of release. Logic holds, though the sudden arrival of multiple ghosts after the child’s dissolution lacks subtle buildup within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Sand Castle Preservation Lab’s sterile yet haunting ambiance is vividly rendered through tactile details (crumbling petals, weight of silence) and juxtaposes the ephemeral with the preserved. The lunch-break timeframe sharpens the isolation. Atmosphere flawlessly mirrors the dissonance theme, though the elevator’s connection to the lab’s setting feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stylistic precision elevates the tale—e.g., “ghosts filled the dissonance between what should be heard and what wasn’t” is a resonant metaphor. The ending’s epiphany (“preservation is just another word for haunting”) crystallizes the theme powerfully. Subtext—liberation through release—is layered and impactful, though the child-ghost’s silent dialogue leans into slight abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by framing ghosts as silent, silence-haunted entities rather than vengeful spirits. The elevator/technician metaphor (“carrying souls between states”) is fresh and thematically rich. While not overly ornate, a few phrases (“beautifully awkward”) border on the poetic but retain purpose. No predictable emotional beats; character nuance emerges through action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s integration of assigned elements is remarkably cohesive, with each piece (flower crown, lab, elevator) interwoven into a unified theme. The 400-word scope feels deliberate, distilling a profound arc into minimal space. Lingering questions about Maya’s grandmother or the ghosts’ origins suggest thematic depth without undercutting the narrative.</comment>
