<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation as a reluctant prophet is clear but lacks psychological complexity. Her persistence feels inherent, not earned, with minimal emotional texture beneath surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose progression from discovery to resignation but lacks narrative momentum. The constrained form works against structural clarity, making pivotal shifts feel abrupt despite lyrical transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic details are evocative (withered vines, salt-crusted glass) but underexploited. Atmospheric potential outweighs execution, with worldbuilding remaining more impressionistic than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Haunting cosmic imagery and thematic coherence elevate the story. Lyrical metaphors (darkness bleeding into darkness, galaxies folding) create lingering emotional resonance despite limited plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids genre clichés through the passive protagonist and cosmic scale. Language occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction but maintains stylistic originality through visceral, specific depictions of entropy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven—core concepts (cosmic scaffolding) work synergistically while others (museum district) feel arbitrary. Style elevates cohesion but cannot fully reconcile all components.</comment>
