<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s tactile attunement to ‘wilderness wisdom’ shapes actions, but motivation lacks psychological depth; his grandfather’s legacy via goggles feels underdeveloped despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coordination of briefcase clues to plot progression is logical yet compressed; abrupt shift from discovering the case to resurrecting the airship lacks incremental tension despite coherent arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust motes, rust, scratched goggles) create a cohesive, haunting decay; atmosphere aligns perfectly with themes of resurrection and defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (e.g., ‘endings as pauses’) and lyrical imagery elevate impact; emotional resonance is undercut by underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some familiar steampunk tropes (abandoned workshops, inherited tools) are refreshed through tactile epistemologies; occasional overdescription (‘prickly wonder’) borders on affected but rarely undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ideas about transformation and collaboration with nature resonate, but story feels conceptually dense rather than emotionally grounded; tight word limit sacrifices narrative intimacy.</comment>
