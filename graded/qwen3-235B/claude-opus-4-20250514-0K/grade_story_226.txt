<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear through physical details and actions, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Desperation drives decisions, but lacks nuanced inner conflict or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Compact structure works within constraints, but the resolution feels abrupt. Unauthorized resonance test cleanly drives plot, though security breach conclusion lacks development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking contrasts between sterile facility and dying orchard create powerful atmosphere. Sensory details like "humming" panels and "withered trees" immerse effectively despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and thematic interplay between science/folklore elevate storytelling. Emotional weight carried well through concrete imagery rather than exposition, though ending oversimplifies resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through synthetic bone-lullaby conceit, but black-market element feels generic. Some overadorned phrases ("haggard awe") border on purple prose, though tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements feel somewhat forced to serve premiseâ€”resonance facility's role seems contrived. Leaves lingering questions about technology's role rather than definitive thematic closure.</comment>
