<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Kira’s obsession with preservation lacks visceral emotional stakes, while Tomek’s loyalty feels narratively convenient rather than organically earned within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but strains under word limits—pacing falters during abrupt time jumps, and the connection between deciphering the poster and the mechanical caravans as "living dictionaries" requires greater narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (e.g., "steel beetles," frost-covered glass) creates a haunting atmosphere, but the mechanical caravans’ metaphorical role as "dictionaries" strains credulity without deeper explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered themes (cultural erosion, preservation) resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on expository closure in the final paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subverts genre expectations with the poster-as-linguistic-map conceit and avoids overt tropes, though Tomek’s mechanical loyalty and the "frozen wasteland" setting occasionally veer into familiar speculative archetypes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole, but the "after the invention of the wheel" timeframe and some heavy-handed thematic parallels suggest a story straining to balance ambition with concision.</comment>
