<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is conceptually clear but shallowly explored; secondary characters lack depth beyond their reactions to illusions, reducing emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from blackout to revelation to quiet aftermath, but the ending feels abrupt and underdeveloped despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush, tactile descriptions (e.g., “borrowed light,” “growth rings as portals”) create an immersive, mystical atmosphere that aligns with the story’s metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong literary voice with layered symbolism (e.g., grandmother’s lunchbox as historical continuity, tree rings as lived time) elevates the piece beyond its slight plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poetic language avoids cliché (“light bent around the room’s specimens”) but occasionally edges toward pretentiousness; emotional resonance relies on concept over nuanced character beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story’s ambition exceeds its structural precision; cohesive themes (memory, defiance) linger, but tighter pacing and character depth would elevate it further.</comment>
