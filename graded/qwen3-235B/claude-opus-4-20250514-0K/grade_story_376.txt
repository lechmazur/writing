<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is intriguing conceptually but remains underdeveloped; motivation exists but lacks depth. Internal world and personality remain vague, with actions mostly transactional rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Basic plot structure exists but lacks complexity; minimal narrative progression with little tension or emotional stakes despite clear beginning/middle/end. Thin cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with good sensory details, but world-building feels like ornamental window dressing rather than organically connected to narrative mechanics or thematic depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Concept has emotional resonance potential with its theme, but relies too heavily on elegant phrasing over deeper emotional engagement or conceptual exploration. Some effective metaphors but thin subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some freshness in the central idea but undermined by occasional flowery excesses and surface-level emotional portrayal; occasionally drifts into genre tropes rather than subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but often feel mechanically incorporated rather than organically integrated; style shows craft but feels more like competent assembly than transcendent creation with lingering impact.</comment>
