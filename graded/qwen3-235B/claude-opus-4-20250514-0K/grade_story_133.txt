<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking throne answers) is consistent but underexplored; reactions to gloves/embroidered map lack emotional depth; dialogue is striking but sparse, limiting voice establishment;</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Painting festival entry and pottery class transition feel abrupt; cause-effect logic holds but pacing strains coherence in 500 words; ending choice lacks earned weight;</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Predictable bloodline mysticism undercut by fresh details (clay extracting memories); some ornate description ("honey over broken glass" voice) risks clich√©, but generally restrained;</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Competent technical execution; ambitious themes feel undercooked due to word constraints; memorable imagery outweighs structural limitations but fails to transcend them;</comment>
