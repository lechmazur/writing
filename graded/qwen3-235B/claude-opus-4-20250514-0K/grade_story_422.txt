<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's mutism is integral to her character but feels underexplored; her use of Arthur to communicate is functional yet lacks deeper psychological nuance, and secondary characters remain thinly sketched despite their narrative roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is mostly controlled, with the overheard phone call driving the central revelation, but the transition to the climactic gathering feels abrupt, weakening the emotional payoff of the "new family" concept within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., "purple foam," corrugated coffee sleeve) enhance immersion, but the parallel universe’s weather logic feels skimmed rather than deeply integrated into the setting’s rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story’s emotional core—finding belonging through shared purpose—is subtly conveyed through action rather than exposition. Arthur’s voice as a narrative device adds a unique layer, and the ending’s quiet hope resonates without overexplaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The ventriloquist trope avoids cliché by tying it to documentation, and weather phenomena (upward rain, timed thunder) feel inventive. However, the term "storm glass" leans on convention, and some descriptions ("euphoric agitation") risk overprecision without emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements cohesively but prioritizes concept over emotional depth. Its brevity works thematically, though the final scene’s euphoria feels abrupt rather than earned, slightly undercutting the intended resonance.</comment>
