<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's analytical approach lacks emotional depth; transformation feels abrupt, though the interplay between reluctance and curiosity creates a nuanced foundation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherent arc but pacing stumbles in the middle; discovery-to-metamorphosis transition feels compressed, though the beginning/end connection is conceptually strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Meticulously detailed setting with visceral contrasts (futuristic/biodecay) and sensory specifics (bioluminescence, texture of tooth) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marks the emotional register through symbolism (tooth as key, fruit as memory) and layered subtext (entropy vs. legacy). Ending resonates thematically without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic turns; metaphors (curse as calling) feel fresh. Only slight purple prose in transitional phrases; emotional beats are earned through action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole, though some (farmhouses as anomalies) feel slightly underutilized. The form follows function for a short piece but lacks ambitious structural risks.</comment>
