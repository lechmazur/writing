<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's grief is clear motive but lacks nuance in emotional evolution; the "lone trapper" identity informs her persistence but isn't fully exploited for deeper psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent within the constraint, but the resolution feels abrupt; decoding equations and launch decision lack intermediate stakes or tension development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends cold technical sterility with cosmic wonder effectively; sensory details (frost, ozone) anchor mood, though the floating observatory feels underexploited as a spatial metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (e.g., black hole as existential doubt, sea glass as crystallized memory) and poetic imagery elevate emotional resonance; ending leans slightly on inspirational clich√©s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in framing cosmic phenomena through a trapper's lens; stumbles with occasional vague descriptors ("vast indifference") rather than visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise and final line deliver punch, but integration of archival elements feels procedural; tone consistency wavers between mythic and mundane.</comment>
