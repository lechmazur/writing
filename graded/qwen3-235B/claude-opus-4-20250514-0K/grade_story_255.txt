<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character voice lacks consistency; seer’s internal conflict is underexplored despite surface-level traits like "naively cynical" being stated. Motivation feels archetypal rather than deeply human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing uneven—encryption decryption lacks tension despite stakes; resolution feels abrupt, undercutting the "decades of obsession" setup. Logical cause/effect in plot are clear but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rain/abandoned tower/create atmosphere through sensory details (petrichor, half-deflated streamers) grounds the surreal in tangible decay. Timeframe’s hush contrasts with hidden conspiracy, enhancing thematic dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong central conflict and symbolic use of "truth as relic" provoke thought, but emotional impact is dampened by telling over showing (e.g., "delayed justice had become her obsession"). Subtext about institutional lies remains potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (e.g., truth-as-relic twist is fresh) but relies on overfamiliar motifs (lone conspiracy theorist with existential revelation). Sensory details are evocative but occasionally generic (“drummed harder” lacks specificity).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements create cohesion through theme, but style occasionally undermines (e.g., “someone has to know” borders on melodrama). Final line (“remember their names”) lingers memorably, elevating the whole.</comment>
