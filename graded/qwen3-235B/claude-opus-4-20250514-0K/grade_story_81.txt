<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (Maya's quest for understanding) are clear but underdeveloped beyond plot function; the advisor remains an archetypal "mystical teacher" figure without personal vulnerability or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pacing is effective within constraints, with a clear arc from confusion to epiphany; some abrupt transitions between abstract concepts and action slightly undercut the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting through precise details (rusting fence accelerated, temporal static); the nostalgic-futuristic tone is well-established but lacks deeper integration with character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphor of time as an empathetic web is executed through tactile, resonant imagery; ending feels purposeful despite slight vagueness in thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts typical time-travel narratives by centering emotion over mechanics; some phrasing (e.g., "time patterns") feels slightly formulaic but redeemed by inventive sensory metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh execution; elements serve narrative logic but lack the transcendent polish needed for prestige publication, with under-illuminated thematic connections.</comment>
