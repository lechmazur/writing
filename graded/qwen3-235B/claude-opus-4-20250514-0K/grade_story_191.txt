<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in tying Marcus' cardsharp skills to his gift for interpreting dreams, but limited psychological depth beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong causal chain linking coffee cooling to disappearances; efficient pacing within constraints, though the climax's resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere through recurring mist/coffee motifs, but underutilizes specific tactile details like texture of ink or sound of trembling lighthouse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose (cards as regrets, inkwell as fate) elevates theme; ambiguous entity's "grudging admiration" adds haunting resonance; ending transcends genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through paradoxical character (honest cardsharp) and original supernatural mechanics; some phrases border on ornate but generally purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize masterfully (inkwell as both plot device and existential choice); brevity feels intentional, with lingering questions about redemption's cost.</comment>
