<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters serve the theme but lack emotional complexity; motivations feel slightly schematic. Elena's anger toward "corporate inevitability" borders on didactic abstraction, while Marcus's transformation is underexplored beyond functional narrative needs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot relies on contrived synchronicity—overly neat overlaps between the logbook's codes and Marcus's habits strain credibility. Subplots about the strike and coalition feel compressed, reducing thematic weight to symbolic shorthand.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vivid but underexploits tactile detail (e.g., salt corrosion, metallic reverb) that could heighten industrial decay. The "wounded season" metaphor creates strong visual tone but insufficient physical atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The central metaphor of "pages carrying messages between worlds" resonated strongly. However, resolution (the coalition forming) feels underdramatized after the precise, intimate stakes established earlier. Subtext about erasure of history is potent but occasionally explicit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity, but certain phrasings ("unstoppable curiosity," "corporate inevitability") verge on didactic simplification. Sensory details (rust-eaten surfaces, barnacle-crusted equipment) feel purposeful yet occasionally generic rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually polished but emotionally uneven—assigned elements integrate logically but sometimes lack lived-in texture. The ending's thematic clarity is undercut by a sense of structural schematicness in how corporate critique materializes.</comment>
