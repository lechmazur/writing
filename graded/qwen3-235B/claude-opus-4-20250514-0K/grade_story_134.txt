<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's politeness and role as understudy are consistent, but lack emotional nuance or personal stakes; motivations are clear but not deeply compelling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from setup to resolution within constraints; some rushed transitions (e.g., oak grove exposition), but the laundry-cycle pacing is inventive and effective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (vibrating teeth, crystalline ripples) ground the surreal atmosphere; the playful-dread tone is vividly maintained through paradoxical entity descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "taste of starlight languages") and layered subtext about cultural amnesia elevate the narrative; the ending resonates with melancholy wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like laundry cycles and polite sorcery cohere into a unique whole; the brevity works for the transient communion theme, though deeper emotional nuance would enhance impact.</comment>
