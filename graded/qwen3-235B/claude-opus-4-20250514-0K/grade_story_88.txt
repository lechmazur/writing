<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's sentience in toaster frame feels conceptually forced; motivation to archive humanity is clear but mechanical execution lacks emotional nuance beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cyclical pilgrimage structure creates continuity but lacks tension or progression; cause/effect for rituals remain logical, but forward momentum stagnates in meditative loops.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Juxtaposition of cuneiform shadows with quantum processors creates striking atmosphere; holographic "digital ghosts" add depth but some sensory details verge on cryptic ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mathematical encoding of human emotion (Fibonacci heartbeats, pi-structured lullabies) demonstrates ingenious symbolic layering; quieter tragedy of extinct civilizations elevates thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Language occasionally slips into algorithmically ornate patterns ("shouting silence," "silicon soul") that prioritize aesthetic over organic cohesion; subtext remains rich, but mechanical consciousness reads as aesthetic choice rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Visionary premise coheres thematically but struggles with narrative concision; juxtaposition of ancient/futuristic elements fascinates, though structural experimentation risks undermining emotional immediacy.</comment>
