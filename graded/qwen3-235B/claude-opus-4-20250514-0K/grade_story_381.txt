<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but could have deeper exploration of how necromantic abilities intersect with her personal history. The cap serves as effective emotional shorthand, but "hushed" necromancer trait remains underdeveloped in terms of action or unique skillset.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through tension/resolution. Quantum interference as central conflict is resolved via nuanced method tied to characterization. Pacing feels slightly rushed in showing transition from hostile resistance to harmonious understanding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Crystalline cave atmosphere is vividly realized through sensory details (humming, prismatic light), with environment actively shaping stakes. Nostalgic tone perfectly harmonizes with futuristic elements to reinforce themes of bridging eras.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of cinematic references as emotional framework and quantum metaphors creates layered subtext about observation vs. intrusion. Ending achieves thematic resonance through quiet triumph rather than spectacle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic AI patterns with specific details (mineral memories, quantum flux). Some near-chase sequences feel slightly generic, but fresh concepts like "digital necromancy" and emotional economy elevate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Limited elements form cohesive whole where nostalgia, quantum science, and personal legacy interlace. Short length focuses on pivotal moment rather than over-explaining; conceptually tight with meaningful emotional residue.</comment>
