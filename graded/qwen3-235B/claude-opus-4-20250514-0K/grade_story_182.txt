<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlow's arc from yearning to realization is clear, but his internal life remains schematic rather than deeply embodied, relying on metaphoric exposition ("quiet hunger") over psychologically textured reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Precipitous progression from discovery to revelation works within tight structure, though the causal chain hinges on coincidence (fortune cookie, dealer's whisper) that feels narratively convenient rather than earned, slightly undermining cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Uncanny atmosphere magnificently sustained through tactile details (magnetic pulse in metal objects, backward birds) and synesthetic layering of crumbling grandeur, creating a setting that breathes as a living relic of chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, kinetic prose ("compasses spun like dervishes") and recursive motif of layering/uncovering deepen thematic resonance about inheritance. Some emotional beats (grief for lost grandmother) stated more than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids genre clich√©s by making magical elements emotionally consequential rather than ornamental. Minimal purple prose, though "frolicsome regret" leans on oxymoron without earned pathos.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Form and content harmonize around the spoon's dual role as family relic and metaphysical tool. Ending feels simultaneously conclusive and open-ended in a controlled way, though the legacy's weight could feel more existentially urgent.</comment>
