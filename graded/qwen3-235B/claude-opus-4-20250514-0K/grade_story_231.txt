<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Enkidu's spontaneity and sentimentality shape his actions persuasively, but Inanna's motivations feel underexplored. Their dialogue reveals thematic concerns but lacks the layered complexity needed for full emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coordinates effectively structure the plot, but the tight word limit creates abrupt transitions. The central conflict (planting the tablet) lacks sufficient buildup, though the cyclical structure (beginning/end with the hairpin) provides cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich details about crumbling columns, texture of the hairpin, and implied historical context create immersive atmosphere. However, the Sumerian setting remains superficially rendered rather than shaping character motivations or the concept's exploration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imagery (ghosts in stone, sheep as contrast to human corruption) and the paradoxical "chaotic teacher" theme elevate the story. The ending transcends simplicity by reframing justice as a humbling process rather than a pure ideal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through specific details (cuneiform on a hairpin) but contains some generic phrases ("sentimental heart in brutal times"). The shepherd-revolutionary concept feels fresh, though priestess tropes slightly dilute originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imaginative integration of elements creates cohesive momentum. The tight constraints necessitate some abstraction (family temple theft backstory), but the interplay between personal loss and societal collapse suggests deeper implications beyond surface plot.</comment>
