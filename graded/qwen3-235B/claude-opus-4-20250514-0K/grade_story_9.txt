<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's panic is implied but not deeply explored beyond sarcasm; motivation for stewardship is clear but underdeveloped, with reactions feeling slightly surface-level despite strong conceptual ties to the puzzle box and environment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Well-connected arc from resignation to action; pacing feels slightly rushed in conveying the decision to plant seeds, but the water ring motif provides cohesion between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive with strong sensory details (neon decay, taste of acid/hope), though the corporate dystopia feels slightly familiar rather than groundbreaking in its atmospheric construction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor (seeds as rebellion) and subtextual warnings about environmental exploitation; the bar-as-chronometer conceit adds narrative depth that lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in combining soothsaying with environmental collapse; avoids most tropes but occasionally slips into didacticism (e.g., "corporate prophets") rather than trusting imagery to carry commentary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite heavy thematic load; uses brevity effectively for mood. Some elements (attribute "probably unlikely") feel underutilized, but the puzzle box/seeds payoff creates narrative momentum.</comment>
