<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character transformation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict rendering his fears and growth slightly surface-level. His "voice" remains consistent in its austerity but doesn't fully differentiate him from narrative trope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed; the revelation about bunkers being prisons arrives too abruptly, sacrificing emotional weight. Pacing stumbles between exposition and thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting has evocative details (ink blotter, oil lamps) that immerse but cultural specificity of the temple remains underexplored, weakening atmosphereâ€™s emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (stars as liberation, bunkers as chains) elevate the narrative. The ending offers satisfying closure, though emotional impact is diluted by didactic conclusions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes (wise mystic, isolated survivor) with limited subversion. The metaphor of broken constellations is original but execution leans on familiar redemption arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive theme emerges but constrained by brevity; elements are serviceable rather than symbiotic. The final reflection feels conceptually rich but underdeveloped.</comment>
