<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's overzealousness is evident but underexplored; motivations tied to grandmother's secrets feel inherited rather than organically demonstrated. Mira functions more as a conduit for thematic ideas than a multidimensional figure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through atmospheric shifts but lacks narrative urgency. The fragmented structure suits the concept but occasionally feels static. Thematic arc resolved, though action-driven progression is minimal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-dream worldbuilding excels with surreal sensory details (humming soil, upward-falling blossoms) that establish a palpable atmosphere. The repurposed highway's transformation into an orchard reinforces existential tone through tactile, haunting imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism ("library reshuffling books," "chronicler of rewilding") are striking. However, some abstract concepts overwhelm character engagement. Ending offers thematic resonance but risks over-explanation. Subtler subtext could elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original concept executed with vivid specifics (goddess-as-ecology) but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("chaotic organization," "synapse of imagination"). Emotional beats feel authorially imposed rather than organically rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Premise handles multiple elements cohesively, despite brevity straining some connections. The highway-to-orchard metaphor grounds speculative ideas, and the open-ended closure invites contemplation. Slight unevenness in pacing.</comment>
