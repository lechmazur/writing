<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the apprentice’s resolve dominates without emotional nuance or psychological complexity beyond her stated purpose. The "bright-eyed" trait feels superficial rather than shaping her choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but uneven, with a rushed transition from decoding to revelation. The terminal activation and coordinate discovery lack visceral stakes despite coherent cause-and-effect, compressing the arc without sacrificing narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like phosphorescent moss and dripping seawater establish haunting decay, though some descriptions border on generic ruin-porn. The setting intricately mirrors the story’s fusion of ancient technology and post-apocalyptic desperation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The story excels in atmospheric symbolism and subtext (hope in collapse) but occasionally relies on expository phrases. The ending resonates thematically but leans heavily on stated concepts rather than earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Avoids overt clichés in fusing tech and mysticism but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("electromagnetic memories"). Emotion is conveyed through context more than lived experience, with some overwrought phrases undercutting tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates a distinctive speculative premise, though the brevity leaves some threads (e.g., ghost origins, water war history) underexplored. The concept-to-story balance leans slightly toward mechanical necessity over organic interplay.</comment>
