<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Characters are compelling but transformation feels slightly compressed; jester's apathy-to-awareness arc requires deeper inner tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot cohesion is strong, but the pivotal "hum of insight" moment lacks sufficient setup for its thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lush, visceral worldbuilding with minor overreliance on adjectives; the mushroom garden's ecology is both metaphor and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent use of subtext and metaphor; some phrasing ("cradled in barbed wire") risks overexplanation, slightly undercutting nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending cartography with familial legacy and fungal symbiosis; occasional ornate phrasing ("genealogy of care") edges toward self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce beautifully thematically, but brief length occasionally strains emotional depth in character transitions.</comment>
