<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; Marcus’ identity as a swindler lacks psychological nuance and emotional stakes, making his calculated exhaustion feel more like a plot device than an organic trait. Clara’s reaction lacks complexity despite her pivotal role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot momentum is occasionally sluggish, particularly in setup exposition, but the frozen computer’s reboot creates a strong causal chain. The climactic confrontation delivers satisfying resolution within the constraints, though the meet-cute mechanism feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding relies on surface-level post-apocalyptic tropes—reclaimed skyscraper orchard lacks ecological logic or sensory immersion. The atmosphere’s juxtaposition of nature and technology is conceptually strong but diluted by vague descriptions of decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Storytelling excels through layered symbolism (e.g., blank tag as immeasurable guilt) and thematic resonance. The final image of sin “growing into justice” evokes haunting subtext. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and the blend of melancholy and resolve in tone achieves emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures through imaginative elements like a financial crisis ecosystem. Language remains taut and evocative; “computer chimed like breaking ice” and “vertical forest” show ingenuity. No indulgent prose, though allies’ disembodied whispers border on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements feel partially forced—reclaimed skyscraper serves aesthetics over plot logic, and invisible allies lack narrative justification. However, the blank tag’s symbolic integration elevates cohesion. The concise format exacerbates pacing unevenness but underscores the central metaphor.</comment>
