<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Priest's former faith drives his arc, but internal logic of his sudden shift from complacency to enlightenment lacks gradual grounding; abacus's role in motivation is underexplored until climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from discovery to epiphany, but the footprints' supernatural mechanics remain unexplained, leaving the snow pattern method feeling more symbolic than logically integrated within the narrative framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celestial light and "dull radiance" create haunting atmosphere, but bean stalks' purpose feels symbolic rather than practical; sensory details like the sound of "cosmic gears" and tactile absence of wind remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor of abacus vs. multiplying footprints as competing systems of meaning is masterful; the ending rejects binary resolutions, achieving thematic complexity about accepting uncertainty as transcendence rather than defeat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids cloying spirituality through visceral metaphors (groaning bean stalks, "radiance cracking like lightning) and avoids resolving the labyrinth's mystery, balancing poetic language with restrained emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Surreal elements cohere around existential themes through consistent metaphor; story's greatest weakness lies in condensed philosophical density making some transitions feel intellectually elegant but emotionally distant.</comment>
