<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is emotionally resonant but lacks depth in internal conflict; motivations align with actions but need more nuanced exploration of his grief beyond profession-based identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on mood rather than narrative progression; the cyclical structure works but lacks tension or transformation within the constrained space; coherence maintained despite limited action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details create a mournful, decaying atmosphere; fluorescent lights replacing oil lamps and parade confetti mirroring coal dust reinforce thematic contrasts effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce organically around central metaphor of mechanization’s cost; brevity feels purposeful in creating elegiac vignette rather than limitation; haunting ambiguity lingers.</comment>
