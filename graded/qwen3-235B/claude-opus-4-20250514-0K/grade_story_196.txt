<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's contradiction (fiercely apathetic yet defiant) is conceptually strong but execution leans on exposition rather than embodied actions; motivation remains abstract rather than dramatized through concrete choices</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single action (following meteor shower) but the narrative arc feels truncated; cause-effect between resignation event and protagonist's decision lacks emotional groundwork</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes floating monasteries well, but sensory details remain generic – the "meteor fragments" evoke visual texture while touch, taste, and sound of the setting are virtually absent</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor (apathy as armor) resonates emotionally; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks visceral impact; subtext about performative detachment carries weight</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through psychological nuance; some phrases ("luminous trails," "star-drunk darkness") flirt with poetic excess but overall voice feels distinctive; character psychology prioritizes introspection over formulaic tropes</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a contemplative whole but none achieve transformative synergy; writing demonstrates disciplined execution rather than revelatory artistry; lingers as a mood piece rather than profound statement</comment>
