<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief anchors her emotionally, but her sheriff persona and motivations cohere more conceptually than through lived details; her transformation feels earned but could deepen the nuance between her public duty and private sorrow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A tight vignette structured around a pivotal moment of realization; cause-effect ties (chain → stellar cartography → rebellion) are clear and purposeful, though the compressed arc could benefit from more stakes or obstacles.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful atmosphere: the suspended midday light, dust motes as stars, and haunted silence create a sensory-rich liminal space where grief and science collide; setting is a character in its own right.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "mathematics met metaphor") and lyrical prose elevate the theme of healing through memory; the ending lands with emotional resonance, though deeper subtext about closure could amplify the impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the poetic imagery occasionally veers toward ornateness, the scientific poetry library and stellar cartography concept feel original; the "ghostly resolve" and rebellion against sorrow are poignant but occasionally echo clichés of catharsis-through-art tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegantly written with a cohesive tone and purposeful structure, but the narrow emotional palette and lack of narrative surprises limit its transcendence to "prestigious" territory, leaning on poetic abstraction over raw human complexity.</comment>
