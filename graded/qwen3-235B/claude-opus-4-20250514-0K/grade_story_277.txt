<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation is thematically resolved but lacks nuanced internal evolution; archivist's "unsure" attribute drives exploration but their voice remains conceptually abstract rather than distinctive or psychologically deep.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Efficient spiral structure builds thematic unity and emotional momentum, though compressed pacing occasionally flattens key revelations; labyrinth discovery to philosophical epiphany arc feels cohesive but slight underdevelopment in middle sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative juxtaposition of crumbling grandeur against delicate craftsmanship creates vivid, haunting atmosphere; sensory details (dust motes, spiral paths) masterfully reinforce thematic tension between received history and buried truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dazzling metaphoric layering (cracked mirror, luminous contradictions) elevates narrative beyond allegory; poetic precision in imagery and subtextual interplay between historical erasure and creative resurrection achieves lasting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through conceptual originality in reframing cyclopean industry as nurturing artisanship, but occasional ornate phrasing ("luminous contradictions") risks veiling emotional immediacy; character psychology remains archetypal rather than deeply human.</comment>
