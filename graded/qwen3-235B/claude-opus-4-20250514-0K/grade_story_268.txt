<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character’s dual role as subdued vigilante shows complexity, but motivations lack depth beyond surface trauma; the bead and mirror hint at backstory but could more fully integrate into psychological portrait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight pacing and focused scope create cohesion; ending resolves thematic tension effectively, though some plot mechanics (mirror’s power) strain credibility within concise structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Abandoned hospital evokes decay; sensory details like cracked windows and flickering light establish mood, but wartime flashbacks and virtual calls create tonal whiplash without deeper synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subtext-rich prose (“screaming silence,” mirror’s symbolic duality) elevates moral ambiguity; ending’s thematic resonance between justice/vengeance lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh concepts undercut by occasional clichés (“ghosts” of war) and mechanical exposition about mirror’s “ancient art”; dialogue avoids predictability but occasionally leans on familiar tropes about systemic corruption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere but unevenly: mirror’s supernatural logic fractures realism, while bead/setting provide organic anchors; concept’s thematic force overshadows minor structural fissures.</comment>
