<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's reticence is consistently portrayed but her bold rebellion feels under-explored; motivation to combat complacency is clear but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cake-timed activation provides tension; some rushed transitions between setup and execution; narrative arc feels compressed but functional.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Wealth of sensory details (water's sound, lantern flicker, tablet's condensation) masterfully creates an atmosphere of decayed grandeur and revolutionary anticipation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Proficient use of metaphor (echoes as institutional resistance); ending balances poetic resonance with thematic clarity. Subtle "showing" of Elara's transformation through physical cues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rejects genre clich√©s; unique synthesis of archaeology and rebellion. Avoids "mad genius" tropes. Language is purposeful but slightly risks overused "scholar's sanctum" imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite constraints; brevity enhances urgency. Leaves lingering question about the consequences of institutional reckoning, though resolution remains implied rather than explicit.</comment>
