<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (frontier between life/death) is clear but thinly drawn; Arcturus' transformation lacks emotional grounding despite thematic consistency</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually coherent but pacing feels uneven; the child’s interruption and resolution occur disruptively quickly, weakening narrative momentum</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse juxtaposes life/death effectively, but sensory overload (humidity/fog/sunlight) occasionally distracts from thematic focus</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of greenhouse and mirrors; emotional impact undercut by ending’s overt exposition of “choice” rather than subtler thematic integration</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mix of original (greenhouse juxtaposition) and clichéd elements (curse-as-compulsion); occasionally ornate prose detracts from human nuance in pivotal scenes</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High-concept elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally forced (e.g., mirror visions’ abrupt shifts); thematic resonance about “simple acts of love” lingers</comment>
