<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cap’s juxtaposition of painted humor vs. hidden mystic depth shows strong duality; motivations tied to honoring his grandmother and bridging divisions are clear but underdeveloped. His analysis of tea leaves reveals insight but lacks emotional payoff for his personal arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tea-reading drives the climax effectively, with tight cause-effect between the wet paint and temporal urgency. Pacing feels slightly rushed in ambassadorial shift, but the circular structure (solitary captain -> shared hope) satisfies within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Steam-and-condensation motifs reinforce claustrophobic tension and transience of peace. Over-reliance on overfamiliar steampunk tropes (gears, brass) weakens originality, though paint-drying gimmick adds visceral urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (tealight hexagons as compromise, "brass belly" of sub) elevate theme. Ending delivers subtext about unconventional diplomacy, but emotional beats occasionally tip into sentimentalism via "children lost" dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Occasional overuse of "melancholic hisses" etc. muddies prose; avoids most AI telltales but relies on steampunk shorthand. Handles tension between mechanical and mystical well, though "crooked hope" strains for profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize conceptually but unevenly executed—submarine setting fascinates yet feels underexplored. Combines assigned traits inventively (tea ritual vs. mechanization) without transcending genre expectations.</comment>
