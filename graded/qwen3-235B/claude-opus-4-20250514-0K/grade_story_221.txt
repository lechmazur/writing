<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivations (rebelling against her mother's rationalism, bridging two worlds) are clear and consistent, but her inner conflict could be more textured. The interplay between her roles as diver and ghost whisperer is implied but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot flows cohesively, driven by Marina's decisive act of shooting the target. The tight structure connects beginning to end, though the rapid transformation of the mosquito into light feels undercontextualized within the internal logic of the ghostly world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Visually arresting details (rusted rifles, amber's prehistoric mosquito, collapsing carnival) create a haunting, specific atmosphere. The setting's connection to family history and Marina's abilities is strong, though sensory depth beyond sight/sound is minimal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layering (e.g., "frozen heart thawing," amber as vessel for trapped pasts, carnival as liminal space) elevates the narrative. The ending resonates thematically while leaving room for interpretation, avoiding pat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity—combining ghost-whispering with wreck-diving is conceptually fresh. Some phrases border on ornate ("chasing ghosts of saltwater and silence"), but emotional beats (grief, reconciliation) feel grounded rather than clichéd.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements interlock: the carnival setting, amber's role, and family tradition are essential to Marina's journey. The story's brevity amplifies its focus on transformation, though the half-written letter motif could resonate more deeply.</comment>
