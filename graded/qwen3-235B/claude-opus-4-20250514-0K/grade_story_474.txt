<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice remains distinct but motivations lack psychological complexity; protagonist's actions align with stated goals but emotional stakes remain surface-level despite the supernatural premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression feels compressed yet purposeful; transitions between spirit testimonies and corporeal threats maintain tension, though the resolution's abrupt shift to Elena feels underprepared for such an influential role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually arresting details like the celestial grotto and living shadows create immersive dread, but underdeveloped tactile/sensory specifics prevent full atmospheric saturation despite compelling foundations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (chess, cooking, chorus) carry thematic weight; the collective voice concept offers intellectual resonance, though emotional impact remains undercut by narrative shorthand in pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by corporate villain trope and overly neat symbolic parallels; avoids AI-like phrasing but occasionally sacrifices nuance for thematic exposition, particularly in Elena's conveniently timed introduction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively within the framework but lack organic integrationâ€”Elena's role and the chessboard symbolism feel more contrived than inevitable, though the revolutionary conclusion leaves a provocative thematic echo.</comment>
