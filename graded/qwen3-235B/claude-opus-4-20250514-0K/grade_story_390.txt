<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly from assassin to florist without sufficient psychological nuance; dialogue feels slightly contrived in establishing motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but relies on convenient coincidences (e.g. garment patterns mirroring flower arrangements); resolution feels rushed despite clever framing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting establishes vague "ancient China" trappings but lacks specificity – the jade-scented corridors and whispered prophecies remain superficially evocative rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of botanical manipulation as narrative control is clever; the twist on assassination subverts expectations effectively, though emotional depth remains limited to linguistic playfulness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While avoiding many clichés, the story occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("whispers of longing into blooms of possibility") that borders on pretension rather than precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements serve plot mechanics better than thematic cohesion; the butterfly motif works as visual motif but struggles to carry deeper symbolic weight within tight constraints.</comment>
