<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentinel’s melancholy and motivation are clear but lack emotional depth; reactions to objects feel symbolic rather than human. Limited character development despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses via introspective dialogue and abstract revelations, but lacks concrete stakes or rising tension. Ending feels abrupt despite thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interdimensional lounge’s surreal, memory-infused details (e.g., shifting windows, sentient chairs) create an immersive, philosophically resonant atmosphere with strong sensory engagement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Intelligent use of metaphor (amber as compromise, origami time) and layered themes (belonging, lost identity) evoke introspection. Dialogue is poetic but occasionally opaque.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some overwritten descriptions (“physics bent like grief”) border on pretentious, but inventive metaphors and nuanced emotional undercurrents suggest human intent over formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Coherent and thematically unified despite tight structure, but thematic ambition occasionally outpaces narrative payoff within the brevity constraint.</grade>
