<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s vendetta and creative background are visually clear but lack emotional depth beyond surface trauma; her actions align with revenge but motivations feel streamlined without complex human nuances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression from discovery to rebellion catalysts is logical, but the compressed timeline (throughout the rebellion) and sudden pivotal choices (sugar sculpture reveal) lean on narrative convenience rather than earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ruined market transformed into rebel sanctuary is vivid; sensory details (shattered confections under boots, refractive sculpture) immerse readers, though the hidden continent’s geography remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storytelling thrives through inventive metaphors (art as resistance, sugar as subversive map) and resonant themes of memory versus oppression; undercurrents of wonder-as-warfare elevate impact beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids AI tropes with fresh imagery (fondant explosives, prismatic coordinates) but occasionally falters into ornate abstraction (“crystalline structure”); emotional beats lean on poetic phrasing over nuanced human reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story coheres through tightly woven elements but relies on condensed arcs; the blend of artistry and rebellion feels purposeful, though some elements (hidden continent) remain conceptually vague.</comment>
