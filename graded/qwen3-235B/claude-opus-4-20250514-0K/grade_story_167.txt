<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei’s motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her “dutiful scholar” identity drives the plot but lacks emotional complexity or internal conflict. Her voice as a narrator is competent but generic, with little distinctive presence beyond functional exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a tight, logical arc from setup to climax. The action is purposeful and cohesive, though the resolution—while fitting—feels rushed (arrest happening mid-thought). Pacing within the word limit is generally strong, with minimal wasted space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (honeycomb pods, humming temporal residue) create a vivid, atmospheric setting. However, “uncommonly typical” as a tone-tilting phrase feels half-realized, and the capsule hotel’s potential for deeper temporal layering is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical yet precise prose enhances the story’s themes. The central metaphor of a suppressed voice “contaminating” a sanitized timeline is powerful, and the ending resonates with thematic resonance. Occasional generic phrasing (“security lights flashed”) dilutes otherwise strong craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story avoids most AI-like clichés, with inventive concepts (time capsule hotel, temporal well) blending seamlessly into the narrative. However, certain phrases (“rushed,” “too late”) lean on predictable cadences, and the Council’s villainy lacks nuance, echoing genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story coalesces into a potent critique of historical erasure, balancing tight structure with thematic ambition. While all elements serve the plot, some—like the “uncommonly typical” descriptor—feel like lost opportunities for irony, slightly compromising cohesion.</comment>
