<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's "brashness" isn't fully demonstrated through action or voice; motivation for preserving games feels somewhat imposed rather than organically revealed. The medal's legacy shapes his actions, but internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite intriguing hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence but sacrifices nuance - the detonation's impact is vivid, yet the compressed arc (entrance → activation → memory release → conclusion) occasionally feels rushed. The medallion's mechanism works logically, though the abrupt security resolution lacks contextual weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong sensory foundation: closing store's fluorescent hum, soot-stained textures, golden motes' fluidity create palpable atmosphere. However, the nautilus/dust dance connection remains abstract, and "dusty exuberance" leans on stated reactions rather than fully embodied transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (dust as memory vessel) and mathematical/spiral symbolism resonate powerfully. The theme of cultural preservation through embodied play offers philosophical depth. Emotional impact is diluted slightly by overt exposition about reciprocity rather than deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elevates clichés (forgotten traditions, legacy) with specific, inventive execution (spirals as encryption, compressed memories). Avoids excessive ornamentation except occasional phrases ("final announcement"). Nuanced employee reactions counterbalance slight predictability in redemption arc structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements with thematic cohesion, though some feel imposed (e.g., "consciously wild" lacks narrative function). The brevity works for urgent rediscovery motif, but emotional payoff would benefit from more textured character reactions rather than generalized weeping/teaching.</comment>
