<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's cold nature manifests as stoic dedication rather than emotional detachment, but inner conflict feels subtly implied rather than fully realized. Motivation for lawful rebellion and artistic awakening lack explicit psychological underpinnings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression flows logically but relies heavily on convenient discoveries (hidden panel, grandmother's notes) rather than active character agency. Pacing rushes emotional resolution despite strong thematic arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sodium-lit streets and abandoned store establish haunting atmosphere. The connection between cold-natured knight and frost-tinged setting works beautifully, though secret agency elements feel underexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering of art and healing elevates the narrative. The mitten as generational connection and altars as invitation to creative empathy showcase strong symbolism. Ending resonates with quiet transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While some phrases border on poetically ornate ("rebellious warmth that had taught him rules existed to protect"), prose remains purposeful. Avoids AI hallmarks but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over emotional nuance in transition moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine ingeniously, but thematic impact slightly underwhelmed by underdeveloped spy elements. The storyâ€™s power lies in symbolic resonance rather than narrative originality, feeling both familiar and fresh.</comment>
