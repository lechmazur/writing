<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's softheartedness is stated but underdemonstrated; motivations tied to her father’s death lack emotional complexity; her fixation on the buckle reveals determination but not deeper layers of character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Simple cause/effect works but feels compressed; stabilizing quantum threads drives the plot but lacks complications; arc is complete yet simplistic, missing tension or unexpected turns within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Neon-drenched setting and dying servers create strong cyberpunk imagery; the planetarium’s tactile details (dust, ancient light) contrast well with synthetic city but could deepen the post-storytelling dystopia’s societal implications.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Impressive metaphors (e.g., "unwritten stars") and theme of reclaiming agency resonate; undercuts its potential with frequent exposition of emotions ("muted euphoria") rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise deftly subverts fatalism tropes; avoids overwrought prose but occasionally relies on AI-esque descriptors ("neon-drenched," "synthetic heartbeat"); emotional beats feel earnest but occasionally formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically consistent whole but lack narrative ambition; the brevity serves a vignette rather than a full arc; leaves a lingering thought but not a haunting one.</comment>
