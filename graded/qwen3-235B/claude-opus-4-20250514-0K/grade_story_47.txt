<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While Sarah's role as a dutiful ward establishes her isolation and resentment toward the theater's transient performers, her terminal illness motivation arrives abruptly, undercutting prior character development; her intellectual depth in reframing performances feels inconsistent with earlier portrayals of resigned caretaker drudgery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression through auditions week creates coherence challenges, but the story effectively binds beginning (discovery of the gloved hand) and end (death/legacy) through consistent thematic focus on mortality; pacing loses some momentum during the middle section's iterative voice note examples.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Velvet curtains muffling sound, cancer-weakened breath, and polished programs create a tactile, decaying atmosphere where silence and ephemerality permeate every interaction; the theater's physicality becomes a metaphor for suppressed truths, enhancing the story's philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "calcified dreams" and "cancer as performance teacher" layer mortality and artifice; the closing juxtaposition of breaking voices/souls against Sarah's silent death achieves profound resonance; every sentence serves the theme of imperfection as truer art.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Some metaphors reach brilliance ("graceless beauty," "death as luxury"), but overly recurring "silence" imagery edges toward repetition; emotional beats rely partially on stated themes in the final note rather than fully shown; otherwise, language remains precise without artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmosphere and thematic ambition overcome minor pacing inconsistencies; the synthesis of performance critique, mortality meditation, and janitorial symbolism creates lingering impact; the framework enhances rather than distracts from the existential core.</comment>
