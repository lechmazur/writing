<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; Marcus' transformation feels inevitable yet lacks nuanced backstory to fully justify emotional breakthrough</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but occasionally contrived; the wallet's placement strains credibility slightly, and the epiphany's timing feels rushed despite strong thematic payoff</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Surprisingly cohesive integration of elements with clear throughline connecting Marcus' stoicism to Helena's vulnerability; occasional forced phrases ("honey-sweetened tea") undermine otherwise organic development</comment>
