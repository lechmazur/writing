<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks depth in motivation beyond simplistic revenge; Maria's actions feel more archetypal than humanized, though the tyrant's nuanced last laugh is a compelling divergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing effectively compresses a clear arc within tight constraints, though the sudden cosmic resolution feels narratively abrupt despite thematic cohesion between dawn as both plot goal and symbolic deliverance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid setting is richly textured with specific sensory details (mercury fountain, gilded light) that heighten tension and thematic contrast between artificial nobility and raw elemental forces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (camera as weapon, fragmented light as truth) elevate the narrative. The ending's emotional resonance transcends the surface plot through layered subtext about art's role in destruction/redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Struggles with occasional overwrought phrases ("dawn preparing to break") but maintains stylistic consistency. Avoids cliché in evocative, specific imagery rather than generic ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Elements are mostly organic to the narrative, though the spiderweb surveillance method feels arbitrarily chosen rather than deeply integrated into the story’s architectural logic.</comment>
