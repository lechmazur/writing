<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity; motivations hinge on abstract "certainty" rather than tangible desires; voice lacks distinction despite first-person elements; reactions to the nail feel more symbolic than personally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained but suffers from compressed arc; capsule discovery-to-distribution lacks intermediate steps; binary star rhythm structures pacing, yet ending feels abrupt without dramatizing the nail's gradual dissemination.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (corrosion, stellar flares, ionized gas) and symbolic use of space (observation deck as liminal zone); setting actively shapes thematic tension between stagnation and change.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (nails as "seeds of certainty"), layered theme of imperceptible revolution, and subtextual critique of mythologization create profound impact; stylistic elegance balances near-poetic prose with narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through eroding revolution framework but strains in places: "materially spiritual" risks obscurantism; some phrases ("false foundations," "liberated dust") verge on abstract vagueness; maintains individuality but occasionally loses precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around core concept without feeling forced; brevity serves thematic compression; raises questions about collective action vs. individual myth; emotional resonance lingers through haunting final image of echoing footsteps.</comment>
