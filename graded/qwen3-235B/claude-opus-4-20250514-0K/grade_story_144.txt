<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chef's role as bridge-builder is clear, but her personal history and internal conflicts remain frustratingly opaque. The music box's connection to her past feels undercooked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot's compact structure works well within constraints, but the transition from conflict to unity lacks gradual development. The narrative arc's abruptness undermines emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere with rich sensory details. The log flume's decayed grandeur adds thematic depth. Some setting elements feel superficially applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and imagery creates powerful emotional resonance. The ending delivers thematic closure but feels slightly sentimental. Subtext about nourishment as diplomacy elevates the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story successfully integrates assigned elements with stylistic flair, but thematic cohesion falters at key moments. While some imagery lingers memorably, the tight word count leaves emotional development uneven.</comment>
