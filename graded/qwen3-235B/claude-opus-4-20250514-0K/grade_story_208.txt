<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of emotional contradictions in maintaining deception. The street musician element feels underutilized beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure balances back-and-present tension effectively, but the emotional climax feels slightly rushed despite strong thematic cohesion between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Postal facility atmosphere is meticulously crafted through sensory details, with setting as character itself â€“ the machinery mirrors protagonist's emotional mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subtext-rich storytelling uses metaphors (machines vs. human disconnection, wet ink in pen) to elevate beyond narrative surface with elegiac grace and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps with fresh metaphors ("dawn cracked...yolk-yellow light"). Occasional ornate phrasing ("mechanically precise disconnections") bordering on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion across elements maintains organic narrative flow. Subtle layering of themes elevates beyond mere concept fulfillment to literary profundity.</comment>
