<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Detailed emotional depth in protagonist's love-driven motives, but internal conflict could be more viscerally shown through reactions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from detachment to dissolution, but the avalanche's exposition and rapid revelation feel slightly rushed despite effective causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive slums with steam and grime, but the interplay between tone ("rambling destiny") and setting occasionally lacks cohesive atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (data avalanche, recipe as code) and thematic resonance in identity/love; prose balances poetic richness with narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of espionage and culinary decryption avoids clich√©; poetic imagery (e.g., "molecules scattering") enhances rather than overshadows plot.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly, with brevity emphasizing existential stakes; slight quibbles with pacing in the avalanche's explanation hinder broader cohesion.</comment>
