<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael's roguishness and cautiousness are demonstrated through action and motivation, but character depth feels somewhat surface-level despite effective behavioral consistency; evolution from outsider to bridge lacks intimate emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains forward momentum through encoded driftwood/rebellion arc; some transitions between backstory and climax feel compressed within word limits, minor logical gaps in decoding process.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Underwater setting is lushly visualized with tactile details (bioluminescence, iron-weighted descent), but the piano motif doesn't fully integrate with the reef world's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors and the silent revolution resonate thematically; ending achieves emotional resonance through showing, not telling, though subtext about artistic legacy is occasionally overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with its music-as-magic premise; some phrasing (e.g., "surging ideals") leans toward abstract vagueness rather than human-nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements synthesize cohesively with minor exceptions; limited space slightly weakens character development, but the final image of humming reefs lingers powerfully.</comment>
