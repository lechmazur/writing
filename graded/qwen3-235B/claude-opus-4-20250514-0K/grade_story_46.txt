<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are conceptually clear but lack emotional depth; assigned traits like "blank-faced" shape her role but aren't fully explored in humanizing ways.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but rushes the central revelation about the Orchard dreaming; cause-effect logic holds despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive with sensory details, though the connection between ferns' "eyes" and the dream-language concept feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ending delivers thematic resonance through "inviting" dreams; strong imagery and metaphor use, but lacks layered subtext beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept execution is inventive, but occasional overuse of dreamlike vagueness and slightly mechanical phrasing weakens emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements are generally cohesive but some (waterfalls' role, plastic ring's origin) feel utilitarian rather than thematically essential.</comment>
