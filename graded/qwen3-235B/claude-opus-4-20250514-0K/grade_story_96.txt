<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's detachment is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations feel archetypal rather than psychologically grounded. The passive resignation undermines narrative agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum relies on inert character; the inciting incident (map discovery) drives progression, but the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, eerie atmosphere created through concrete sensory details (reverse-speaking ravens, shatter-purr cats) and metaphysical tunnel system. Tonal consistency sustains immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphysical poetry in prose form—lyrical, recursive imagery ("ink wounds," "indifference as devotion") creates haunting atmosphere. Ambiguous ending invites thematic reflection without neat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Evasive individuality—avoids genre clichés while maintaining poetic cohesion. Stylistic flourishes enhance rather than overwhelm. Some phrases approach abstraction-as-substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity, but the economy of a 500-word narrative limits deeper integration. The final image resonates conceptually but risks glibness in its nihilistic acceptance.</comment>
