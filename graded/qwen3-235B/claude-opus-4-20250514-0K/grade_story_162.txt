<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters are atmospheric but motivations remain underdeveloped; the "carefree gambler" trait contradicts Marcus' introspective consistency, and Elena's "uniquely trustworthy" assertion lacks behavioral evidence to fully convince.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meandering dialogue-driven structure lacks narrative momentum; beginning/end connection is present but underpowered, with tension dissolving into vague acceptance rather than earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with tactile details (crinkling blueprint, degrading tapes, rain) creates immersive melancholy; timeframe and location choices synergize to amplify the story's thematic resignation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric language and poetic melancholy elevate the prose, but emotional subtext remains surface-level; dialogue feels performative at times rather than revealing deeper fractures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes in tone, but contains minor formulaic phrasing ("islands fading at dawn"); emotional nuance exists but wavers between showing and telling; consistent voice saves it from artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully woven but not indispensable; brief length emphasizes thematic ambiguity over plot; evokes mood more effectively than delivering concrete narrative closure.</comment>
