<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength: Clear motivation (interstellar love matching) aligns with renegade status. Weakness: Character remains largely archetypal despite intriguing premise; interiority feels somewhat abstract rather than psychologically complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: Clear throughline from button's discovery to cosmic revelation. Weakness: Some abrupt transitions (e.g., button dissolution) and compressed arc leaves emotional beats underdeveloped within tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: Zeppelin-library setting effectively combines terrestrial and celestial elements; "high-altitude wind" and whispering books create immersive melancholy. Weakness: Misses opportunities to connect sensory details more deeply to character experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphor of universe as "vast dating algorithm" offers striking concept; thematic coherence about transcendent love. Weakness: Some emotional states are stated rather than embodied; poetic language occasionally veers toward abstraction over active engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Unique combination of matchmaker trope with hard sci-fi elements resists easy categorization. Weakness: Sporadic ornateness ("complicatedly simple etchings") risks overshadowing more grounded human elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength: Conceptual framework creates lingering resonance about cosmic connection. Weakness: Narrative cohesion strained under multiple high-concept elements; certain components (flag method, zeppelin's purpose) feel more decorative than essential.</comment>
