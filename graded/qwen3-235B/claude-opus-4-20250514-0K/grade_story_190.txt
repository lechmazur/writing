<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characterization shows ingenuity in Marcus's paradoxical "passionate disinterest" but lacks visceral emotional texture. Elena's transformation feels abrupt despite structural necessity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clocked pacing compresses cause-effect into tight space. Resolution feels earned but slightly telegraphed; espionage mechanics serve the arc but lack narrative elasticity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decaying tech, sterile surveillance, and arid atmosphere interweave with emotional desiccation metaphors. Medical/drug-induced confessionation underutilizes tactile medical equipment details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density (memory-as-music, empathy-as-clairvoyance) elevates thematic resonance. Subtext about algorithmic coldness vs human feeling is deftly layered beneath action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through biological data encoding. Purple prose tendencies emerge in Elena's prophetic dialogue but are counterbalanced by crystalline imagery elsewhere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Operatic in miniature - each element connects to the theme without feeling mechanically inserted. Final line's ecological-humanist metaphor lingers like mineral taste.</comment>
