<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack deeper psychological complexity; Zara's shift from secretive seeker to collaborative partner feels rushed, though her sensory connection to spices and preservation methods reveals occupation-specific authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent discovery-to-connection arc within constraints, but the pivotal moment of decoding blueprints feels underdeveloped; the word limit compresses emotional escalation and stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting merges ornithological rehabilitation with scholarly decay evocatively; the sanctuary's metaphorical resonance for broken things remade is strong, though raven symbolism could be more thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (saffron stains like fingerprints, crumbling marigold as time capsule) and layered themes of preservation-as-creativity elevate the narrative; the ending's romantic and thematic convergence feels emotionally earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with its encoded schematics-as-childish-doodles conceit; emotional subtext is shown through tactile details rather than exposition, though some descriptor clusters border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in narrative execution; the brief format prioritizes ambiance over psychological depth, sacrificing some thematic nuance for poetic resonance.</comment>
