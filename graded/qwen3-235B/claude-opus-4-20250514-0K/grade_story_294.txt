<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; emotional resonance remains surface-level despite evocative metaphors. The bard’s transformation lacks visceral psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—voicemail exposition disrupts immersion; the "prison of the self" arc resolves too abruptly for full emotional payoff within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly immersive with tactile, chromatic details; however, the fungus-hall’s liminality feels underutilized beyond ambiance—no ecological logic or cultural context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors sing; the prism/doubt/song synthesis is thematically cohesive. The final performance-as-liberation is emotionally resonant, though some phrasing leans toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is undercut by occasionally overwritten prose (“crisp languor,” “infinite onion”) and a self-actualization arc that hews too closely to familiar archetypes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gelid atmosphere and fragmented selfhood are compelling but unevenly weighted; some elements (voicemails, mushroom hall) feel imposed rather than organic.</comment>
