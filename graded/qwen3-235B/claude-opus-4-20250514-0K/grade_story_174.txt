<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's profession as a fireworks designer is foundational, but her "wandering" aspect remains underexplored. Motivation is clear but lacks nuanced vulnerability; augmented reality choice feels narratively efficient but minimizes emotional complexity in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot leverages tight structure: frost patterns initiate action, library enables resolution, augmentation drives theme. Pacing is economical but occasionally compressed (e.g., Sara's final days referenced rather than felt). Logical consistency maintained despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (sulfur-stained fingers, frost melting) create immersive atmosphere. Waterfall/library paradoxically blends mysticism with tangible chemistry. Subtle contrast between sterile mountain coldness and the warmth of augmented memories deepens emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (fireworks as unspoken love, freezing/melting time) operate on dual levels. Ending subverts expectations by rejecting erasure for layered truth. Emotional impact emerges through Sara's unseen fireworks—showing over telling. Lyrical restraint elevates thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with "augmentation over alteration" conceit. Frost mechanics verge on mystical but earn logic through pressed leaf parallels. Some phrase repetitions ("subtle paths," "ephemeral nature") hint at algorithmic reflexes. Emotional nuance in Sara's final days is implied but not deeply textured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically: frost patterns as both obstacle and key; fireworks as both failure and redemption. Short form constraints leave minor gaps in character depth but maintain narrative inevitability. Lingering question about time's plasticity elevates beyond self-contained premise.</comment>
