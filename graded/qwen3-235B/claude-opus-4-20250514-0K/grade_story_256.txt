<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional evolution; motivations align with traits but execution feels abstract rather than viscerally realized through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative momentum generated by the concept collapses in final paragraphs—betrayal resolution feels abrupt, underdeveloped relative to established stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lush but unevenly rendered settings; grocery/cafe duality creates intriguing liminality, but the transition lacks sensory specificity at pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness (stardust lattes, time’s soft edges) elevates literary merit, though emotional distance prevents deeper thematic resonance despite precise technical execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cyclical cosmic imagery risks pretension; avoids overt clichés but contains AI-like tonal oscillations between poetic abstraction and mechanical structure (e.g., typewriter motif).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional payoff; cohesion strained by juggling multiple fantastical elements without sufficient narrative grounding.</comment>
