<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's mechanical intuition and cultural ties drive actions, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped and motivations lean on trope-heavy mysticism rather than deeply personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from transcribing equations to knowledge preservation, but the abbreviated arc and lack of narrative tension leave the ending feeling telegraphed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poignant whole; brevity serves its elegiac tone while raising questions about cultural erasure and technological legacy.</comment>
