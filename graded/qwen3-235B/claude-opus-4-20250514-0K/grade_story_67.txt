<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters function as thematic symbols more than fleshed individuals; motivations are implied through dialogue but lack psychological depth or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Circular structure prioritizes metaphor over narrative progression; abrupt transitions between emotional beats undermine coherence within the constrained format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk-adjacent imagery creates visual cohesion, but atmospheric elements remain superficial embellishments rather than organic extensions of the characters' inner worlds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasionally lapses into abstract philosophizing over embodied experience; some phrases ("anti-light") veer toward empty stylization rather than earned emotional truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptually rich but structurally fragmented; thematic ambition exceeds narrative execution despite strong central metaphor.</comment>
