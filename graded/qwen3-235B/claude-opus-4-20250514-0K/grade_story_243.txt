<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Malachar's jumpy nature manifests in reactive gestures but lacks interiority; his necromantic methods align with resurrection themes but feel superficially applied. Motivational throughline connecting his digital haunting of "deleted sectors" to mural decryption remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing falters during incantation scene - too abrupt a shift from analysis to spectral uprising. Narrative throughline from footsteps-as-inciting-incident to system-reboot-resolution maintains fragile coherence despite compressed structure. Cause-effect logic holds but strains under time compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Phosphorescent pixel-drips as coded graffiti offer striking tactile-digital hybrid imagery. Retro aesthetic permeates descriptions but atmosphere remains visually dominant - few evocations of glitched textures beneath fingertips or static-choked code-fragments in the air to fully materialize the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphor of overwritten source code as theological heresy offers potent subtext. Subsurface tension between preservation and erasure resonates through sprite-revenants, though emotional weight relies too heavily on abstract "betrayal" rather than personal stakes. Ending's mechanical reboot lacks human consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rejects genre scaffolding by making glitch-aesthetics into political palimpsest. Fishhook's lunar trigger avoids mystical gimmickry through code-breaking application. The "system maintenance cycle" vulnerability introduces temporal specificity that subverts typical fantasy-logic with IT-era concerns.</comment>
