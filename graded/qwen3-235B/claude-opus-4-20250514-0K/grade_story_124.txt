<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains thinly contextualized; motivation to explore subconscious through dance feels imposed rather than earned through psychological realism. Behavioral shifts from skittishness to calm mastery lack sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses through atmospheric shifts rather than incident; dance-as-technology mechanism remains under-explained. Opening and conclusion connect thematically but lack dramatic payoff within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lunar setting effectively rendered through tactile sensory detailsâ€”whispering polymer floors, barbershop memory. Atmospheric congruence between silent command center and post-workshop stillness creates immersive contemplative mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (loom=woven tech, dance=subconscious access) create thematic cohesion. Language elevates without becoming self-indulgent; ending resonates through understated revelation rather than exposition. Central idea about intuition interfacing with systems is thought-provoking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overtly poetic phrasing sometimes undermines clarity ("swept hair formed constellations on checkered floors"). Sensory details generally vivid, but ballet technique descriptions lack specific kinesiology that might add authenticity. Emotional arc told more than shown in developmental moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but occasionally feel schematic rather than organically integrated. Setting achieves strongest fusion of sci-fi premise and poetic metaphor. Brevity works with thematic abstraction but hinders complete character maturation.</comment>
