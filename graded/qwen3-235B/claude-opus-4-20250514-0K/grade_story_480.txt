<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation shift from exorcist to ally is underexplored; protagonist lacks emotional depth despite concept's potential; assigned attribute "quietly loud" only superficially rendered in shadowwhisper's screen-typing; voice remains overly generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear chase structure but resolution feels rushed; cause-effect between receipt→music hall→clubs is coherent but mechanical; three club sequence borders on checklist-like progression; climax raises thematic questions without full narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (phantom chords, flickering screens) but tonal coherence falters—hyperconnected urban decay contrasts uneasily with salvific analog settings; object-setting connections (receipt's physicality vs digital haunting) remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conceptual subversion of "haunting" as critique of social media's artificiality offers strong thematic weight; memorable imagery of data-fetishist cults delivers visceral impact; ending delivers intellectual resonance through conceptual inversion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls but shows synthetic fingerprints—overreliance on "digital decay" tropes (abandoned spaces, flickering screens) without fresh subversion; some overly precise descriptors ("quietly loud") replace genuine emotional nuance; cult structure feels trope-adjacent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story coheres as tech-paranoia allegory despite tight constraints; elements serve theme but some feel imposed (three clubs as checkbox progression); brief format works for mystery pacing but shortchanges philosophical debate resolution.</comment>
