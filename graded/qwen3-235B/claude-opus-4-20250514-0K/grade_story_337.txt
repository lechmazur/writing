<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mei-Lin’s actions (writing forbidden fortunes, interpreting fractured tile) align with her motivation to preserve tradition. The grandmother’s handwriting adds emotional depth, but her interiority occasionally feels secondary to symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tile’s shift drives the plot toward the oracle, culminating in transformed fortunes. The tight word count strains some transitions (e.g., sudden appearance of the lens), but structure remains cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope studio’s infinite reflections mirror the fractured-fortune theme. Sensory details (jagged tile, dawn’s threat) enhance the oppressive-yet-mystical atmosphere. Slight vagueness about the regime’s specifics doesn’t detract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose (“fortune finds those who break tradition while honoring it”) and layered metaphors (cracks as wisdom) create intellectual and emotional resonance. The ending elevates the theme beyond platitudes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through specific, haunting imagery (e.g., “fortune crumbs” mirroring kaleidoscopes). Subtly critiques state-enforced optimism without didacticism. Occasional phrases (“sacred rebellion”) teeter toward abstractness but don’t overwhelm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements (studio, tile, oracle) serve thematic coherence. The brief format amplifies the tension between fragility and resilience. Leaves an enduring meditation on creativity under oppression.</comment>
