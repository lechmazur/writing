<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but psychological depth is lacking; Eleanor's obsession remains unexplored beyond surface traits. Internal conflicts between her duty and personal costs are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but resolution feels abrupt; connections between diary decoding and reconciliation occur rapidly without emotional payoff. Pacing remains competent but slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; starless night and brass fixtures create mood but sensory details thin toward conclusion. Setting-object connections exist but lack full integration with character psyche.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical crosswords-as-communication create intellectual resonance; forgiveness-as-absolute-truth theme is poignant but ending lacks emotional payoff. Literary devices are clever but emotional impact remains cerebral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative innovation; brevity serves purpose yet emotional subtext remains underexploited. Conceptual framework suggests depth that execution only partially realizes.</comment>
