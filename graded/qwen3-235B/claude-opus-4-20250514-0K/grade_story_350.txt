<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Protagonist’s motivation is clear but feels surface-level; emotional complexity is stated rather than demonstrated. Family legacy drives actions, but internal conflicts remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on convenient connections (gown tears as a map), with some logical gaps. Pacing is uneven; the climax feels rushed, undermining the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but underutilized. Sensory details are sparse, weakening immersion. The temple’s potential as a symbolic space is only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., puppets as truth-bearers) elevate the narrative. Themes of censorship and legacy resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some fresh ideas (e.g., stamps as encoded symphonies) and vivid imagery. However, the tone occasionally veers into melodrama, with overused phrases ("pulsed with approval") undermining originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but strained under word count constraints. Elements are purposeful yet occasionally forced; themes linger provocatively but lack full textual support.</comment>
