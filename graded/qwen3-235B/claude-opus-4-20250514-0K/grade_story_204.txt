<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s profession as a professional cuddler grounds her motivations and actions, though her internal conflict about prejudice could have deeper exploration. Her voice is distinct but occasionally veers into overt thematic exposition rather than organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence with a clear emotional arc, though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The decay action drives inevitability, while the chance encounter setup creates organic momentum. Pacing within the constraint is deft but could tighten further.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lushest when describing the spaceport’s rust and broken light, with tactile details (warm mist, phantom punch sounds). The acceptance speech hush metaphor introduces tone without fully integrating into the setting’s logic, slightly diluting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evokes profound emotional resonance through metaphor (decay/stability as interdimensional empathy). Subtext about prejudice and bridging divides is layered. Dialogue is sparse but resonant; the ending crystallizes theme without oversimplification. Shows over tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with the Faders’ fresh existential premise. Metaphors like "wind chimes in an empty house" are vivid. Some phrasing ("ancient novelty") risks vagueness. Emotional nuance is shown, not merely stated, with minor exceptions.</comment>
