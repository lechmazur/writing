<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivations are conceptually strong but lack emotional depth; interactions with the statue imply a history without illuminating her inner conflict or past. Dialogue reveals her mission but undersells her humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is taut but leans heavily on exposition (statues as "pressed souls") to deliver revelations. Pacing is efficient, but the word limit creates abruptness in the statue’s transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lush, tactile details (granite voice, moonlit paths) create an eerie, mythic atmosphere. The enchanted orchard and living statues are visceral and thematically resonant, grounding the metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (stolen memories as "pressed" souls) and the chilling twist elevate the story. The ending’s moral stakes resonate, though dialogue occasionally veers toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original, cohesive style avoids clichés; metaphors like "stone-slow reflexes" feel fresh. Some phrases ("dour amusement") risk affectation, but overall voice is distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting parable. Tight prose and a chilling premise linger in the mind, though the abrupt resolution weakens its potential for deeper thematic resonance.</comment>
