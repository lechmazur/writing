<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are compelling but underdeveloped; Mikhail's isolation and transformative drive feel logical but lack psychological nuance that would elevate him from archetype to fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight pacing within constraints; the lantern-to-suit progression is cohesive but lacks emotional escalation, with the biodome rescue feeling rushed despite strong symbolic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evocative Martian environment through terse sensory details (rust storms, dim sunlight) but underutilized tactile elements; biodome decay shows potential for atmosphere but remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "wove future into existence") resonate strongly; theme of rebirth through repurposing is clear but could benefit from subtextual layers beneath the literal survival narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid specificity in brass fittings and hydroponics decay avoids generic SF tropes; some phrases ("weight of recycled dreams") skirt ornate abstraction, but the mechanical poetics mostly remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize well with theme but prioritize plot utility over deeper thematic resonance; the brevity works for urgency but sacrifices secondary character exploration that could enhance emotional stakes.</comment>
