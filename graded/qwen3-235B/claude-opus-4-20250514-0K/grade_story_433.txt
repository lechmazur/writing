<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness drives plot but interiority feels underexplored; the "wholeheartedly broken" line resonates but lacks connection to consistent voice; interactions with curator lack emotional nuance despite thematic significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is generally effective but struggles with compression - the pivotal night scene feels underdeveloped for such a transformative moment; the cyclical structure (beginning/end at gallery) provides cohesion but doesn't fully overcome the constraints of the word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (frosted windows, breathing walls) and thematic setting work create a vivid, memorable atmosphere that shapes both character and theme; the ephemeral ice gallery's impermanence perfectly mirrors the protagonist's journey toward acceptance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (melting ice as surrender), elegant symbolism in gallery's breathing walls, and resonant ending create significant emotional impact; the "price of power" theme resonates through both story structure and specific image choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but contains occasional generic phrasing ("hardheaded traveler"); some transitions feel slightly mechanical but are outweighed by original concept; emotional arc feels earned rather than explicitly stated despite occasional exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into unified thematic whole despite constraints; the gallery's physical impermanence and prophecy fragments aren't fully maximized but remain strongly connected to character arc; leaves readers with quiet reflection rather than abrupt conclusion.</comment>
