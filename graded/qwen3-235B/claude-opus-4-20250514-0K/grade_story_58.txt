<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mara's loyalty and unraveling psyche are implied but inconsistent in execution; transitions between seeking meditation and deciphering codes feel unearned; motivations lack gradual build.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from meditation to counter-sabotage logically but compresses Mara's transformation unnaturally; cause/effects clear but pacing rushed; thematic resolution is abrupt yet conceptually complete.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere establishes tone through moth migrations mirroring inner chaos but underuses moth observation tower-specific details; sensory details selectively evocative without full environmental immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of storm/descent metaphors; emotional undercurrents remain surface-level at key moments; ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional payoff due to brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Contains fresh spy-concept hybrid but slips into familiar trauma language; emotional states frequently named rather than shown; some overwrought phrases dilute sincerity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements present but functional rather than synergistic; brevity constrains cohesion; tone shifts feel incomplete; concept blending shows promise but uneven execution.</comment>
