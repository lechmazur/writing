<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the girl’s “aggressively kind” determination lacks nuanced backstory or emotional depth, reducing her to a symbolic figure. The ghost’s lingering attachment feels underexplored despite thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ritual drives the plot effectively, but tight pacing leads to some rushed transitions—for example, the sudden activation of the lighthouse beam. The arc from intrusion to resolution is coherent but occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over cause-and-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cracked windows, writhing shadows) create a haunting locale. However, the moonlit glow of the whistle and cold temperature could be linked more explicitly to the ghost’s presence for greater atmospheric synergy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of memory as preservation resonates, conveyed through strong metaphors (whale-song-as-ritual). The ghost’s partial resolution is emotionally poignant, but the story leans on lyrical abstraction over visceral emotional specificity in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The concept of reviving forgotten traditions via a mundane object is inventive. Avoids clichés like generic hauntings; the plastic whistle’s transformation avoids predictable tropes. Some phrasing (“dust motes like ghosts”) borders on overused but remains evocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>The story’s thematic ambition outpaces its execution. While the ending suggests cyclical rebirth, the rapid pacing leaves character dynamics and the ritual’s societal implications underexplored, reducing its potential to linger as a profound meditation on legacy.</comment>
