<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's traits as an introverted dancer are integrated into her problem-solving, but her emotional arc feels condensed. Her motivation to escape is clear, though the psychological complexity of her transformation lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story moves logically from isolation to escape, but the resolution feels abrupt. Logical leaps (e.g., charts glowing) lack sufficient buildup, though the tight word limit is managed competently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desolate atmosphere is palpable through sensory details (e.g., "old paper and resignation"), and the cipher office’s decay mirrors her isolation. However, the wasteland’s symbolic weight is underexplored compared to its potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("cosmic rhythms," "wasteland... crucible") and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The ending resonates thematically, merging dance and astronomy into a metaphor for liberation, though pacing occasionally prioritizes poetry over clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original in premise (knitting as code-breaking), but some phrasing ("her spirit had already learned the steps") leans cliché. The fusion of dance and astronomy is inventive, though the decoder’s "forgotten echoes" trope feels derivative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Skillful integration of constraints into a cohesive narrative arc. The brevity enhances the mythic tone, though the ending’s emotional resonance could be more earned than stated.</comment>
