<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (rigid scribe’s conflict) are clear but lack nuanced exploration of his past. The witch’s depth relies on minimal exposition; their dynamic feels archetypal despite resonant imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured within constraints, but the Tesla vision sequence disrupts pacing. Cause-and-effect ties together, but Elias’s abrupt transformation could benefit from layered buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere with gothic motifs (gravestones, glass structures) enhances mood. Sensory details (trembling glass, crystalline adhesive) immerse but inconsistently sustained beyond key scenes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (quill/trowel, bulb as beacon) deepen themes. Ending resonates with symbolic weight, though emotional impact leans on familiar archetypes of transformation without fully subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in blending Tesla’s science with magical realism. Avoids clichés but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing (“glass parasite”). Shows stylistic individuality but leans on predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements serves thematic unity. Brief length feels intentional but sacrifices depth. Lingering metaphor of buried innovation works well, though secondary elements (gravestones) remain underexplored.</comment>
