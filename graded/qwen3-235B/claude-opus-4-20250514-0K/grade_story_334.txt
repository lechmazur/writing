<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's overconfidence and fear are established but lack depth; motivations feel conceptually sound yet emotionally underdeveloped. The spinning top's role in revealing his turmoil works conceptually but lacks visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong cyclical structure between the top's spin and Marcus's decision-making creates coherence, but the pivotal choice feels undercontextualized. Parallel reality glimpses are compelling but underutilized due to tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Magnetic observatory provides intriguing backdrop but remains superficial beyond its functional role. Sensory details like humming equipment and flickering rifts establish mood but lack distinct immersive texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (top, magnetic field) effectively mirror internal conflict. Ending lands with quiet power, but philosophical themes about truth vs stability remain more asserted than organically explored through character actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids obvious AI markers; writing is purposeful but occasionally veers into conceptual abstraction ("gods of mediocrity") rather than earned emotional complexity. Some elements (parallel selves) feel trope-adjacent but are elevated by the ending's simplicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive framework with thematic resonance across elements, but brief scope prevents full exploration of multiverse implications. Final choice feels earned yet insufficiently weighted by previous narrative beats.</comment>
