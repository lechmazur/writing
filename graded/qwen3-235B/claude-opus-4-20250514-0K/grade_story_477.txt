<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to flee conformity aligns with his actions, but lacks depth beyond symbolic function. Swordsmanship as cosmic language feels conceptually tied but emotionally ungrounded; internal conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure pivots abruptly from atmospheric setup to cosmic revelation. Pacing is tense but uneven; the arc is complete yet feels compressed, sacrificing nuanced development for conceptual payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting’s vivid aquatic decay and electromagnetic eerie enhance mood. Sensory details immerse effectively, though logistical gaps (e.g., breathable air?) undercut physical logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., swordsman as “translator”) elevate thematic resonance, but emotional engagement is muted by heavy abstraction. Ending leans on lofty ideas over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of cosmic signals and underwater decay avoids cliché, but “suppressed individuality vs. authoritarian drones” echoes overused tropes. Prose occasionally lapses into self-indulgent flourishes (“metallic flower” telescope).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition ties elements together, but execution unevenly balances poetic speculation with narrative coherence. Lingering idea—individuality as cosmic necessity—is potent but thin.</comment>
