<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited character interiority; motivation is stated but thinly developed. The assigned attribute "eager" lacks sufficient behavioral grounding beyond surface-level actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent but compressed arc; the action-to-resolution pacing feels rushed. The poltergeist corraling lacks full logical progression within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details anchor the hybrid setting, but tonal oscillations between sci-fi and supernatural elements create instability. Atmosphere occasionally overwhelms character grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphor layers (thread/time, chaos/order) and emotionally resonant theme of digital/organic longing elevate impact. Some ideas are described rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of ancient/modern and supernatural/tech avoids pure trope-mining, though certain phrases ("shimmered with recognition") border on poetic formula. Sentience-as-loneliness concept is insightful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly seamless, but some mechanics (bio-systems synchronizing with heartbeat) feel tacked-on rather than organically earned. The premise's ambition occasionally outpaces execution.</comment>
