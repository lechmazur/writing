<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation as a “sincere rebel” is consistent, but her internal conflict lacks the layered complexity needed for full psychological resonance. Her shift from bitterness to purpose feels slightly rushed despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc (entering passage → discovery → transformation), but the resolution’s emotional weight feels condensed. The inscriptions driving the plot are effective, though the final storm reference introduces a slightly abrupt, unresolved tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (shifting walls, “bitter tang”) create a vivid atmosphere. However, the “haunted” aspect is intellectualized rather than emotionally haunting, and the “between storms” timeframe’s symbolic role remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic interplay between preservation and change, with resonant imagery (living equations, shifting shelves). The ending resolves the immediate plot but lacks visceral emotional payoff, leaving deeper implications underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by framing fear as responsibility rather than malice. The mathematical equations and “living” architecture subvert expectations. Some phrasing (“ancestral fear”) skims the edge of formulaic introspection, but overall the style is purposeful and lean.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are meticulously threaded (torn note, shifting structure, storm framework) without feeling contrived. The theme of tradition as a dynamic burden is sharply articulated. Word count constraints feel artistically embraced, though the climax’s emotional texture is slightly thin.</comment>
