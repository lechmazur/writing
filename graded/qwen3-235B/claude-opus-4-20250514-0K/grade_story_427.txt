<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is undercut by the sudden emotional resolution; the philosophical motivations are clear but the transition from obsession to regret lacks sufficient nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is driven by the duel but pacing issues arise from the word limit; the arc feels rushed, with logical but underexplored cause-effect dynamics, particularly in the final epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s sensory details evoke isolation but its setting isn’t fully woven into the philosophical themes; the atmosphere is evocative yet occasionally disconnected from deeper narrative purposes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (mechanical arm as philosophical extension) and subtext; the ending’s emotional weight and symbolic resonance elevate the story’s impact considerably.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original combination of philosophical duelism and cybernetics avoids cliché; emotional depth in the sock’s reveal suggests human-like nuance, though the lighthouse setting leans slightly generic despite strong stylistic prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but uneven integration of setting and timeframe weakens cohesion; the emotional core and conceptual blending justify the premise, though some aspects feel underexplored within constraints.</comment>
