<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reeves’ wryness and emotional distance are consistent, but her internal conflict could be deeper; her motivation to escape the “what-ifs” is clear but lacks layered exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from marking time to cosmic cloud realization; escape feels earned despite brevity. Pacing is efficient, though transition to vanishing feels abrupt given word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting delivers stark isolation via frozen pirates and claustrophobic cargo hold. Cosmic visuals are vivid but underutilize the pirate ship’s potential—feels generic beyond superficial details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as door, “taffy” seconds) and haunting imagery elevate the narrative. Ending resonates thematically, blending melancholy with triumph. Subtext on acceptance is poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with cosmic dust as a temporal key. Language balances poetic clarity with purposeful restraint. Emotion shown through tactile details (chalk, dust) rather than stating; fresh but not overly complex.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Elements cohere into a thematic whole; brevity highlights, not hinders. Raises questions about time’s fluidity, leaving lingering resonance. Minor issues with pacing and underdeveloped setting keep it from perfection.</comment>
