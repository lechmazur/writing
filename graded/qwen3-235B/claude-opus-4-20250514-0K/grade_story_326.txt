<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; Vera’s emotional connection to her grandfather and her park is implied rather than explored, and her personality beyond determination feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arc is coherent and driven by the assigned action, but the walkie-talkie interruptions feel jarring and underutilized, slightly disrupting pacing and tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive fairy realm, but the connection between the cosmic timeframe and the plot is underexplored, limiting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (e.g., fan, fire) elevate the narrative, but the ending feels slightly rushed, and some dialogue lacks subtext. The theme of collaboration vs. limitation is effective but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in blending fairy lore with theme-park decay, but the walkie-talkie device and "sweetly fierce" queen verge on cliché. Writing avoids excess ornamentation but occasionally leans on familiar metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively enough, but the park’s role is underdeveloped, and the walkie-talkie’s urgency lacks emotional weight. The story lingers on themes of legacy but falls short of profound resonance.</comment>
