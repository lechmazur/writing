<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character shows some development from conflicted envy to humility-driven revelation, but lacks depth in motivations beyond surface-level sibling rivalry and insecurity. The "confident watchman" trait feels inconsistent with his insecurity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc with logical progression from discovery to resolution. However, the symbolic "mobilize" action (coloring activating patterns) feels abrupt; the beehive setting justifies some abstraction but pacing falters slightly in final act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually vivid with strong sensory details (humming chambers, translucent walls), but atmospheric cohesion suffers—'echo of yearning' remains under-explained and disconnected from physical environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Impressive metaphorical layering (crack as enlightenment), but leans excessively on "crack is where the light gets in" cliché. Subtext about humility vs. expertise is compelling; emotions occasionally over-explicated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity but contains predictable emotional beats (e.g., "forgotten genius" trope). Style balances precision and lyricism but occasionally indulges in overwritten passages ("geometric dreams," "amber chambers") that feel stagy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Highly atmospheric but thematically uneven—some assigned elements (microscope-related pattern analysis) appear shoehorned. While individual prose shines, structural unity is compromised by overambitious conceptual layering.</comment>
