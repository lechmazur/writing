<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Promising character traits like intellectual dedication are present, but "brainy observer" manifests primarily in exposition rather than nuanced decision-making or unique thought patterns. Motivation to find lost civilizations remains serviceable but undercomplicated—drives plot mechanics more than revealing profound character dimensions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to revelation, but the brevity creates structural unevenness—crucial steps (doll activation, alien contact) feel expedited. The bay responding to art is clever but lacks internal logic explanation, making the cause-effect chain slightly arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bay is rendered with sensorially rich details that align perfectly with the theme of transience. Some atmospheric elements (doll warmth escalating, light-cities emerging) stretch credibility, but overall the setting's eerie beauty deepens the narrative's philosophical undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant ideas about impermanence and cosmic humility emerge effectively. The metaphor of ephemeral art as "strength through weakness" works symbolically, though the ending's didactic exposition ("You've found humanity's next path") slightly undermines subtlety. The core theme remains well-sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes by linking alien contact to artistic vulnerability rather than technological might. Some familiar constructs (ancient aliens testing humans) persist, but the focus on temporary art as the key and the doll's subversion of typical "artifact = power" expectations demonstrate creative ingenuity within genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrate logically, though some (vintage jacket's "timelessness") serve tone more than narrative engine. The doll/test structure feels engineered for plot rather than organic development, but the central metaphor connecting art to evolution provides cohesion despite tight constraints.</comment>
