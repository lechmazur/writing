<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations implied through grand purpose, but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes beyond abstract cosmic battle; Mira's actions are plot-driven rather than fully realized internal logic; "peculiar collector" trait remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Puzzle-solving structure provides clear progression; pacing slightly uneven in middle sections; convergence deadline creates urgency but resolution feels abrupt; key placement mechanics drive plot but lose some narrative texture in tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid quantum computation imagery and ghostly time charts create potent atmosphere; sensory details about warm pencil stub and metallic keys ground the fantastical elements; fractured grace tone maintained through physical metaphors and damaged beauty references.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brilliant metaphoric construction (pencil as graphite nerve, lost theorems as buried civilization potential); bittersweet catharsis emerges organically; ending shows rather than tells through awakening timelines; elevated by thematic cohesion between creativity suppression and cosmic redemption.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids direct genre clich√©s but verges on overdetermined symbolism (particularly the "desert flowers after rain" simile); emotional restraint prevents over-explanation but may hinder reader connection; generally maintains consistent poetic tone without drifting into incoherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work together as precise thematic machinery; each assigned component contributes to layered meditation on cultural erasure; compression allows concept exploration without sacrificing narrative momentum; ending leaves resonant questions about creation vs preservation.</comment>
