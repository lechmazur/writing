<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is poignant but underdeveloped; the "shaky mercenary" label drives some actions but lacks visceral depth in showing how trauma manifests beyond trembling hands; motivation for seeking peace is clear but feels abstract rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to word constraints with a coherent arc—arrival, realization, release—but relies on compressed exposition through backstory fragments; pacing stumbles slightly during implied journey across continents; the final act resonates, though earlier setup feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the decaying cathedral as "street artist’s haven" juxtaposes sacred and profane beautifully; sensory details like echoing acoustics and twilight’s golden light immerse readers; the setting actively shapes the mercenary’s emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story excels in lyrical metaphor ("living mandala of release") and emotional subtext; the amber’s symbolism transcends gimmickry to evoke existential tension between stasis and movement; ending achieves thematic closure without preachiness, blending quiet catharsis with lingering mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on familiar tropes (haunted mercenary, mystical artifact) without sufficiently subverting them; some phrases ("betting everything on...") border on abstract vagueness; emotional resonance is hindered by occasional over-reliance on poetic phrasing over psychological specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion despite layered elements; the amber and cathedral function as unified symbols; while individual components are strong, the synthesis feels slightly curated rather than organically urgent; the brevity enhances focus but sacrifices deeper exploration of character psychology.</comment>
