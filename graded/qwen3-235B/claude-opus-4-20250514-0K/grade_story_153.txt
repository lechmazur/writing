<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually strong but underdeveloped; Marcus's eternal pursuit is clear, but his internal conflict and emotional depth remain abstract, relying on grand ideas rather than humanizing details.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coherent progression from discovery to transcendence; pacing is tight but occasionally rushed, particularly in the mechanics of digitization-to-collective-consciousness, which lacks narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imaginative setting details (geothermal cities, bioluminescence) create strong atmosphere, but the mole people’s culture and physics of "eternal darkness" are unevenly explored, leaving worldbuilding gaps.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (headlamp’s death vs. "souls shining") and theme of collective immortality over individual permanence resonate, but emotional impact is muted by clinical, often abstract prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise marred by occasional clichés ("twelve thousand deaths") and overly ornate phrasing; some ideas (post-star society) feel generative but lack the gritty specificity of human-authored strangeness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate logically but unevenly—the journals and setting are indispensable, while Marcus’s endless studies feel like a framing device rather than a narrative engine.</comment>
