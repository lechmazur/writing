<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct 'voice'; motivation is abstract rather than specific, making emotional connection difficult despite thematic focus on war's aftermath.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; while atmospheric, it reads more as a prose poem than a narrative with progression, causality, or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral through sensory details (dust, peeling paint), but the 'virtual calls' timeframe feels underdeveloped and disconnected from the character's practice.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (mirror distortions as societal trauma) and subtext about war's lingering effects, but the ending lacks forward momentum or transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical passages contrast with overly abstract phrases ('price of war' remains nebulous); avoids clich√©s but risks pretension through dense conceptualism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements coexist thematically but feel juxtaposed rather than coalesced; the tone is unified, but the brevity prioritizes mood over narrative cohesion.</comment>
