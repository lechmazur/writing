<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually present but underdeveloped; stage fright as a trait lacks concrete behavioral manifestation beyond trembling hands. The conflict between "power counterfeit" and "sculpting possibility" remains abstract rather than embodied through specific choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained within tight constraints but lacks narrative propulsion - key turning merely triggers static introspection rather than catalyzing meaningful progression. Circular structure between opening/closing "never usual" feels contrived rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting effectively juxtaposed with earthbound wildflowers; "cosmic graveyard" metaphor and silent hum create strong atmosphere. Sensory details about texture of brittle flowers vs metallic click need expansion for full emotional impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism of submerging lies in orbital debris has conceptual resonance; "defiant hush" motif works through repetition. Some "telling" undermines emotional potency (e.g., "his movements were quiet, deliberate"). Ending lacks earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique exorcist-in-space premise. Avoids purple prose despite lyrical imagery ("sculpt possibility from ashes"). Some redundant metaphors ("debris of past"/"inheritance of lies") and underutilized potential in "key turning" device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements function collectively with minimal friction but lack profound interconnectivity. Story works as mood piece but lacks narrative urgency that could elevate it beyond atmospheric vignette. Lingering impact resides more in concept than execution.</comment>
