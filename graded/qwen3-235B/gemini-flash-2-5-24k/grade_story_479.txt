<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation ties well to the core theme but lacks psychological depth; her "myth of ordinariness" belief feels more like a narrative device than a lived conviction, weakening emotional resonance. The brass tape as a familial heirloom hints at depth but isn’t leveraged to fully explore her internal conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elongation drives the plot, but the process lacks tension—resistance from the archive is mentioned but not dramatized. Pacing feels static, with minimal narrative progression despite a clear conceptual arc. The tight word limit compresses cause-effect relationships, reducing emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (e.g., "glowing expanse," "cool brass") but unevenly developed; the social network archive risks feeling like a superficially altered "digital afterlife" trope. Sensory details lean heavy on visuals; auditory/kinetic elements that could heighten immersion are underused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of "elongating" digital echoes is poignant, and the juxtaposition of ancient ritual with modern tech is cleverly subversive. However, emotional weight leans on exposition (e.g., stating "jubilant remorse") rather than immersive crafting of those feelings. Ending feels conceptually complete but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by merging tradition with digital archiving. The brass tape’s symbolism is fresh, but some phrasing ("fruitlessly patient") borders on contrived. Internal logic is sound, yet the story occasionally prioritizes concept over character nuance, leaning on abstract ideals rather than human-scale stakes.</comment>
