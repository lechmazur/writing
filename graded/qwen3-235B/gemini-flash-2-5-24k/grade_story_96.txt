<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (surprising fate) is clear and consistent, but the poet's personality remains opaque beyond assigned traits; "disinterested passion" lacks nuanced exploration through actions or subtext.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity through seizing the map, but progression from contemplation to action feels underdeveloped; pacing is deliberate but lacks visceral momentum within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, eerie atmosphere created through sensory details (damp fur, sighing owl), yet the menagerie's elements rarely deepen thematic resonance or influence character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "brimming cup" and "unmapped directions" elevate thematic depth; ending avoids epiphany in favor of quiet determination, balancing subtlety with emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through original phrasing, but phrases like "accumulated weight of unexpressed verses" flirt with abstraction; tone remains consistent despite occasional lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Elements serve thematic purpose but feel curated rather than organic; the concise length amplifies poetic imagery yet limits exploration of emotional stakes in character's choice.</comment>
