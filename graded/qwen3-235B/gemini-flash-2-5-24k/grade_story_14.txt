<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Possesses a coherent personality shaped by professors' influence, but motivations verge on abstract; "spark" lacks concrete emotional grounding despite symbolic ties to defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minimalist structure works within constraints; candle-pouring serves as focal point, but pacing fluctuates between poetic immersion and static contemplation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral (salt/wax/indifference of ocean), though symbolic weight occasionally crowds lived-in details; setting functions more as existential metaphor than tangible world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evokes melancholy defiance via candle symbolism and cosmic bargaining; occasional overreliance on lecture-derived ideas dilutes emotional subtlety; ending resonates conceptually but lacks physicality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but risks preciosity (e.g., "laughing tears"); language balances poetic and authentic, though some phrasing (professors' "wild theories") leans toward stylized abstraction rather than psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work in concert (professors → gamble → candle), but thematics occasionally overshadow narrative momentum; brevity is effective but leaves emotional undercurrents underexplored.</comment>
