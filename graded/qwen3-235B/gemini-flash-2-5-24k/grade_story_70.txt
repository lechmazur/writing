<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s rigidity and empathy motive are consistently portrayed through precise actions and internal shifts, but her transformation feels abrupt rather than emotionally earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The adhesive analysis methodically drives the plot toward the climax, though the bellow’s immediate physiological impact on the bulb strains logic within the tight arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The decaying gravestones and greenhouse fusion of tech/magic create a rich, sensory-laden atmosphere that deeply informs the narrative’s tension between control and wildness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like “arms of steel” and the theme of merging science/sorcery elevate the story, though emotional beats lean heavily on abstract phrasing over visceral, embodied details.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichéd descriptions but occasionally defaults to high-flown abstraction (“fertile ground for discovery”) that slightly dilutes the immediacy of Elara’s revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a cohesive exploration of rigidity vs. wonder; the truncated length feels intentional, enhancing the story’s haunting, elliptical resonance.</comment>
