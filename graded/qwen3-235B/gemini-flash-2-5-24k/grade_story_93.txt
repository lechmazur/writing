<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (understanding sacred geometry) is abstractly hinted but lacks visceral grounding; actions (evasion) feel more reactive than purposeful. The labyrinth architect trait isn't meaningfully connected to his methods or personality. Interiority remains elusive despite first-person-like narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear evasion sequence but strains coherence under tight word count. Cause-effect logic holds (radio guides him to exit), but emotional stakes remain underdeveloped. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over structural precision, with underexplored connections between "unspoken bonds" and plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and original: the archive's sensory details (dust/microfiche/static) create oppressive claustrophobia supporting desperation. Sacred geometry as "chaotic survival" contrasts beautifully with structured setting. Timeframe's unresolved farewell lingers more as mood than narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layer (geometry in chaos, archive as prison) elevates beyond thriller tropes. Subtext about rigid systems collapsing resonates, but emotional beats rely on abstraction ("desperate hope" remains intellectualized). Writing style is poetic but occasionally obscures character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasionally defaults to abstract vagueness ("structured chaos," "ghost in the machine") rather than concrete originality. Sensory details avoid genericness. Sacred geometry theme feels fresh but underexplored—more atmospheric device than thematic spine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong between abstract elements (geometry, archive, radio) but weaker for human elements (bonds, farewell). Brief length enhances tension but leaves conceptual themes under-resolved. Lingering thoughtfulness about order/disorder tradeoff suggests depth.</comment>
