<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks driving urgency, with actions feeling more symbolic than psychologically grounded. The "strongly weak" attribute remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has circular structure with levitation as a mystical pivot, but lacks narrative progression. Cause-effect logic for the courier's ability is underexplained, and pacing feels static despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (runic signs, weeping stones) immerse readers, but the "between games" timeframe remains ambiguously defined, weakening cohesion between concept and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (ink pot as village subconscious) and themes of resilience under pressure shine, though the ending’s resolution feels underexplored. Emotional nuance exists but is unevenly balanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids clichés, with lyrical prose mostly avoiding "purple prose" traps. However, some phrases (e.g., "jubilant despair") lean on conceptual abstraction over lived-in detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Most elements fit cohesively (ink pot, levitation), but others (strands of courage, "between games") feel imposed. The brevity works thematically but sacrifices narrative momentum.</comment>
