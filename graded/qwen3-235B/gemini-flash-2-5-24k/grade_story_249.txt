<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation ties to plot but lacks layered nuance. Actions align with traits yet remain surface-level; dialogue minimal but consistent. Distinctive traits exist but lack psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end within constraints. Pacing efficient but slight unevenness in setup. Logical cause-effect but resolution feels abrupt despite coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally serve narrative cohesion, though some stretch believability. Short form works for stealthy heist pacing but misses opportunities for emotional resonance.</comment>
