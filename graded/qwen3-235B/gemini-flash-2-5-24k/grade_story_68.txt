<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's moral code and motivation are clearly defined but lack emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflict feels underexplored despite surface-level hints at nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Structure follows a simple arc (retrieve → discover → resolve) but lacks narrative complexity; transitions between plot points feel rushed, with limited rising tension despite clear beginning/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Blends ancient and digital elements effectively for atmosphere, but sensory details (steam, weight of wood) are sporadic; setting occasionally feels like a superficial backdrop rather than an integrated component.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of lost history and reclamation of identity is compelling, but relies on heavy-handed exposition ("monster was humanized"); stronger subtext or character-driven emotion could elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Concept avoids overt clichés but occasionally defaults to generic "lone hacker seeking truth" tropes; prose is crisp but includes slightly overwrought phrases ("cold certainty," "anachronistic chaos") that hint at artificial polish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly threaded into a cohesive premise, but the story’s brevity prioritizes concept over emotional resonance; leaves a thoughtful impression without deeply provoking reflection.</comment>
