<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has consistent internal conflict and symbolic connection to puzzles/secret, but lacks deeper psychological complexity and relatable human flaws.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion replaces traditional plot structure; tension exists as an eternal present rather than clear arc, which works within constraints but risks staticism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid setting with tactile details (wind, waves, string texture) that create immersive oppression, though the lighthouse's specificity could be more distinct from generic isolation tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment>Uses effective metaphor ("secrets wriggling") and layered themes, but occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over visceral emotional grounding, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing through original imagery and philosophical depth; some phrases ("weight of secrets") border on clich√© but are elevated by intricate contextual layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve each other with remarkable purpose; brief length amplifies existential weight; prose style elevates technical constraints into thematic strength about fragmented understanding.</comment>
