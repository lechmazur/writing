<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s dual motivations are clear but lack depth in personal backstory; introspective narration establishes voice but feels archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear search-and-find arc with logical progression, but the tight word limit constrains emotional payoff; resolution feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid steampunk details immerse readers in texture and sound, though the post-wedding timeframe’s emotional residue is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (waves, mechanical heart) elevates the theme; ending resonates but relies slightly on explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evasive of generic tropes with fresh parallels between patient searching and natural erosion; some phrases (“scattered harmony”) risk abstraction without deeper grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole, though some assigned components (e.g., “scattered harmony”) feel curated rather than organic; thematic resonance outweighs minor contrivances.</comment>
