<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's penitent motivation is clear but lacks personal history; actions align with traits but inner complexity remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Static plot structure; tension between problem and resolution exists but lacks narrative arc progression or satisfying resolution within constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and conceptual metaphors engage but emotional impact weakened by lack of character specificity and narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional clich√©d phrasing ("icy warmth") and abstract logic; poetic devices elevate but can't mask structural thinness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements check-boxed with mixed integration; story exists as self-contained moment but feels overly constrained by its own checklist rather than organically developed.</comment>
