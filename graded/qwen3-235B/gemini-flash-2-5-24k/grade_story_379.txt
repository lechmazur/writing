<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's trickster background and linguistic preservation drive are clear but underdeveloped. Motivation lacks full emotional grounding; internal conflict shown through actions but psychological nuances missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has momentum via dares but resolution is cyclical, not arc-driven. Pacing slows during exposition; cause-effect between clues and actions occasionally strained. Completeness undercut by lack of stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hyper-specific sensory details (synthetic rain hum, hydroponic bay's engineered life) create immersive atmosphere. Setting's artificiality contrasts poignantly with fading languages, but timeframe during stretching underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ghost motif and language preservation offer intellectual resonance. Shows emotional maturation but relies too heavily on internal monologue; pivotal moments could be dramatized more.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains traces of "redemption arc" formula. Metaphors (language as "linguistic ghosts") effective. Occasional generic descriptors ("faded gift tag") when specifics needed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively but short length prevents full thematic exploration. Structure suggests potential for extended work. Lingering thought about moral reinvention through constraint.</comment>
