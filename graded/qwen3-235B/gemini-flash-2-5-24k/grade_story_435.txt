<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; "peculiar faith" and calcification themes drive action but lack psychological depth. Elias' impersonation method is logical but thinly justified. Voice remains consistent yet flat.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels compressed; baking phase drives urgency but resolution is abrupt. Cause-effect between quiet pulse and calcification remains abstract. Pacing adheres to word limit but sacrifices momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is intriguing (ozone/sensory contrast) but underutilized. Vapor facility's thematic role is strong, but environmental details are sparse. Timeframe "during baking" lacks visceral integration with setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (calcify as metaphor) are conceptually interesting but surface-level. Tension is present but undercut by abstract prose. Theme of rigid systems vs. fluidity lacks emotional anchoring. Ending feels unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in vapor facility concept, but execution wavers. Some phrases ("laws carved in stone") border on clich√©. Subtler character nuance and smoother integration of "occasionally frequent" are needed. Avoids outright purple prose but feels faintly schematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere functionally but not organically. Short length serves tension but limits thematic payoff. The story gestures toward metaphysical rebellion but leaves resonance unexplored. Stylistic clarity wins over complexity.</comment>
