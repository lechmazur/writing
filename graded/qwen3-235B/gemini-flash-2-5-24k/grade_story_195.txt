<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding uses vivid sensory fragments (dust, wind) but fails to integrate the nomad caravan’s culture or spring cleaning’s thematic role into narrative mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist thematically (thread-identity-renewal) but narrative cohesion suffers from underdeveloped linkages; stylistic ambition occasionally overrides clarity.</comment>
