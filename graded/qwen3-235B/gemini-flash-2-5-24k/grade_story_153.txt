<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but portrayed through abstract exposition rather than nuanced actions or contradictions. The eternal student archetype feels underdeveloped, relying on detachedness as a substitute for complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is static, lacking escalation or resolution. The repetitive nature of data transfer creates rhythm but no momentum. Connection between beginning and end exists through thematic repetition, but the story floats without structural anchoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through claustrophobic sensory details (dust motes, damp air) and the mole people's indifference. The underground setting and headlamp's symbolic contrast with dying stars masterfully reinforce existential isolation, though the mole people's culture remains underexplored.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bureaucratic transcendence" and "distributed backups" offer intellectual resonance, but the prose occasionally drifts into abstract generalities. The ending's circularity suits the theme but sacrifices emotional payoff for thematic consistency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through unique combinations (crystalline journals, mole people). Some phrases ("crushing weight of time") border on overused, but the core concept of digitization-as-liberation contains inventive philosophical stakes that feel distinct.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (immortality → digitization → isolation) but the story's vignette structure prioritizes mood over narrative drive. The underground setting and data-journals particularly enhance cohesion, though character and plot remain conceptually prioritized.</comment>
