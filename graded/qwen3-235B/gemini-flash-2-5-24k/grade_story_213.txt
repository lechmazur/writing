<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is a symbolic vessel rather than fleshed-out individual. Motivation to "usher in a sunrise" is clear but lacks psychological depth, with actions dictated more by allegorical purpose than human-like complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc (ritual at dinner table) but fails to coherently link the photosynthesis lab as a narrative driver. Pacing rushes the connection between scientific premise and climactic act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contrasts sterile lab and festive restaurant effectively but sensory details are inconsistent. Wedding venue atmosphere is vivid, but photosynthesis lab’s influence on the world feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (plastic clip as narrative engine) work well, but climax relies on abstract tell-don’t-show. Theme of stories shaping reality is clear but emotionally detached. Resolution lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visionary concept undermined by repetitive abstract phrasing ("primal sophistication," "delightfully strange" without earned irony). Symbolism feels derivative (sacred object in mundane setting) rather than groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not synergistic. Plastic clip and "destroying disbelief" stand out, but lab-wedding table contrast lacks narrative payoff. Brevity works against deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
