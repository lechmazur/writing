<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are stated but not fully embodied through concrete actions or distinct voice. Sheriff role remains symbolic rather than psychologically convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No plot progression; exists in stasis. Begins/ends with same scenario. Abstract concept of rebellion drives nothing tangible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory detail in the library's fusion of science and art. Midday lull enhances the oppressive quiet. Atmosphere transcends typical setting into character itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery is striking, but lacks narrative tension. Subtext about silence as resistance remains underdeveloped. Ending circles without resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in combining sheriff/police procedural with metaphysical quest. Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction rather than earned emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements form mosaic rather than narrative. Strong atmosphere not balanced by character/plot substance. Poetic but lacks transformative arc.</comment>
