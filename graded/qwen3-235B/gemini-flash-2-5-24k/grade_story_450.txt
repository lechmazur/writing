<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underexplored; her sharp-wittedness isn't fully demonstrated beyond physical mimicry. Linguistic ineptitude serves as an existential constraint rather than shaping her interactions, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on abrupt transitions between memory and revelation. The mimicry-driven arc lacks subtle buildup to the prophecy's twist; pacing falters in balancing emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is atmospheric but underdeveloped; the chamber's purpose remains ambiguous. Sensory details like "cooling water" and "shimmering" atmosphere are evocative but sporadic, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "denial as a shroud") elevate the narrative, but occasional overuse of abstract terms like "saturated ambivalence" dilutes impact. Voice feels polished but not distinctly original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong, but brevity weakens resolution; the family's potential reactions to the patch feel underexplored. Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional execution within the constrained length.</comment>
