<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "no-nonsense" traits and empathy shape actions consistently, but lacks inner conflict or depth beyond surface-level archetypes. Motivation is clear but one-dimensional, never interrogating the cost of preserving humanity’s ghostly legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a soothing arc of tension and resolution through mollifying the ornament, but its simplicity within the word limit feels predetermined rather than earned. Pacing is deliberate but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Haunted dollhouse museum is evocatively rendered through sensory details (dust motes, glassy eyes), and the timeframe’s eerie emptiness amplifies the story’s melancholy. Atmosphere flawlessly supports the theme of preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (heartbeat as tradition) and symbolism (glowing bird) are effective but not transcendent. Subtext about legacy resonates, but emotional impact feels curated rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core concept leans into familiar tropes (artisans as humanity’s saviors) with minimal subversion. Some phrasing ("dust motes danced") feels overly ornate. The fusion of dollhouse scale with cosmic themes is inventive yet occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Story cohesively integrates all elements thematically, but the brevity limits exploration of deeper existential questions. Style enhances clarity but lacks the audacity to make the premise unforgettable.</comment>
