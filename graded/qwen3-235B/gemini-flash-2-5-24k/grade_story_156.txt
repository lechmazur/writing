<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character shows consistent traits (confusion, boldly timid resolve) tied to his diplomatic background and evolutionary motivation, but lacks tangible actions demonstrating growth or transformation within the limited scope; interiority dominates over external narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on abstract thematic arcs rather than concrete action; structure lacks forward momentum due to absence of specific obstacles or turning points, leaving the liberalization mission vague and unearned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (mineral scent, claustrophobic silence) and complements the joyfully tragic tone, though the salt mine's oppressive history feels underexplored despite its symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evolocentric metaphors (flock patterns as "counterpoint of hearts") and thematic subtext about individual/collective tension offer intellectual resonance, but emotional engagement is diluted by excessive abstraction and passive narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overuse of oxymoronic phrasing ("boldly timid," "joyfully tragic") and overwrought descriptors ("liberalize," "evolutionary wisdom") risks sounding formulaic; the flock symbolism is somewhat inventive but strained in application.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fundamentally cohesive and conceptually ambitious, but struggles to balance density of assigned elements with narrative economy; lingers in thematic abstraction rather than dramatizing tangible stakes or resolution.</comment>
