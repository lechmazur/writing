<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Consistent motivation and actions, but lacks depth in personal history, internal conflict, or growth. The character remains abstract rather than deeply individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained, but pacing stumbles—realization feels abrupt, and the middle section lacks incremental development. The cyclical beginning/end works within constraints but feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (corrosive air, leached colors) powerfully anchor the decayed world. Atmosphere enhances theme, but a deeper exploration of the acid rain forest’s dangers or inhabitants could add dimension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (feather as tactile truth, puzzle as nonlinear agency) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates thematically but could deepen emotional stakes with more visceral character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subverts tropes (post-apocalyptic monarch) but occasionally relies on ornate phrasing (“lethargically energetic”). Emotional nuance is present but risks being overshadowed by abstraction. Feels purposefully stylized, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with a contemplative core, but the brief format limits emotional immersion and narrative momentum. The concept’s ambition outpaces the execution’s visceral impact.</comment>
