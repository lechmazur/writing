<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but the orchardist's transformation feels somewhat rushed; Elara's endearing irritation is effectively tied to interactions but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc from isolation to connection, driven by the key's revelation. The compact structure works but some emotional beats could be more gradual; cause-effect between Elara's discovery and the orchardist's change is logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (neon streets, synth-fruit glow) create vivid atmosphere. Cyberpunk setting enhances themes of disconnection but could explore time period nuances more explicitly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (key as emotional bridge, garden as sanctuary-turned-connection space). Dialogue feels natural. The theme of connection through openness is clear but could subvert expectations more.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some phrases (e.g. "guarded heart") verge on trope territory. Emotional showing is stronger than telling, though not consistently innovative; narrative voice has individuality but contains slight artificial phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but could integrate more synergistically. The cyberpunk framing and emotional arc merge effectively, though certain assigned elements (x-out, interconnected lives) feel slightly programmatic. Leaves contemplative impression.</comment>
