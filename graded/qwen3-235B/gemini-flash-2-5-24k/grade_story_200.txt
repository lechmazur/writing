<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation and hesitation are conceptually rich but lack concrete manifestation through action or decision-making; inner conflict feels abstract rather than viscerally demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from preparation to action within constraints, but pivotal moments lack emotional payoff; cause-effect logic is present but understated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative but sparse sensory details; the resonance chamber's unique properties are underexploited in shaping the atmosphere beyond auditory motifs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mix of original metaphors (compass as conceptual guide) and abstract phrasing ("savage serenity") that occasionally veers into self-conscious stylization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are individually well-integrated but collectively feel more like a suite of literary devices than a unified narrative; thematic ambition outpaces emotional realization.</comment>
