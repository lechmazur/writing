<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara's professional rebelliousness and quest for the city are consistent but lack deeper psychological complexity; her connection to ancestral traditions reveals motivation but could use more personal stakes or conflicting emotions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear structure (doubt → ritual → resolve) is coherent but lacks narrative tension; the ritual’s symbolic revelation feels under-integrated with the physical journey promised in the ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (shimmering ink, resonant hum) evoke mood, but the "lava flow" coffee shop setting remains atmospheric window dressing rather than thematically vital.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("ink as forgotten songs") elevate the prose, but emotional impact is muted by abstractions; themes of tradition/reinvention are clear yet philosophically underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar magical realism tropes; lyrical descriptions occasionally tip into ornate generality ("collective memory of her lineage") rather than unique voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but unevenly – family traditions and the city myth drive the narrative arc, while the coffee shop setting feels superfluous; ending establishes momentum without distinctiveness.</comment>
