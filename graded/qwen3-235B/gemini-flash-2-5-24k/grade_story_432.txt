<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara’s death wish is hinted but not deeply integrated with her actions or psychological nuance; her obsession with mapping energy flows dominates, yet the interplay between her traits and decisions lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot’s tight focus on the final second before collapse drives tension, but the connection between psychic data and the ice sculpture’s collapse feels under-explained; pacing is efficient but some cause-effect logic is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory detail (roar, mist, groaning ice) immerses readers in a starkly atmospheric cathedral-cavern; the setting’s ethereal weight mirrors the stakes, though the energy grid’s visualization strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bizarre science of psychic noise" and shimmering energy flows evoke intrigue; the ending’s fusion of completion and surrender is thematically resonant but could deepen its subtext about control vs. chaos.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction (e.g., "serene upheaval") over human specificity; the psychic-radio method feels inventive yet risks AI-like conceptual whimsy over grounded emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story’s ambition is evident, but integration of elements like "hidden societies" and the bookmark’s symbolism feels partial; the brevity works but leaves some thematic threads underdeveloped.</comment>
