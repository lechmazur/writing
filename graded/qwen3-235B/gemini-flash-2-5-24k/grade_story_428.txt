<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tension between control and chaos fuels character, but motivation shifts feel underdeveloped. Third-person allows introspection but lacks visceral emotional specificity in depicting transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but resolution feels abrupt. Ritual action is atmospheric but strained by metaphysical implications. Pacing uneven in balancing concept and containment within limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting provides atmosphere through sensory details (incense, dust) but spiritual weight feels borrowed. Timeframe connection to distant deal lacks tangible stakes to anchor coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lingering emotional resonance through ink/stain symbolism and duality of control/embrace. Metaphoric strength elevates thin plot. Subtext about authenticity lingers despite rushed elements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of urban decay and cosmic ritual avoids genre clich√©s. Some overly poetic phrases ("crumbling stone" x2) risk redundancy. Spiritual quest feels human but teeters near abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but mechanical integration varies. Brevity serves meditative tone yet strains plot progression. Lingering thought about masks vs. authenticity achieved despite uneven seams.</comment>
