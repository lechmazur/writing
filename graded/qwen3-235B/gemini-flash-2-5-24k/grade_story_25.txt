<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth despite vivid physical attributes; motivation for transformation feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Cold intensity is shown but not fully integrated into internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows cyclical logic but lacks dramatic pacing; tension between reality and fantasy remains static. Ending closure feels abrupt, with no discernible climax or stakes despite thematic promises.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Visually striking elements (glowing forest, brittle diary) contrasted poorly with theater setting; atmospheric details overwhelm cohesion. Sensory descriptions often ornamental rather than narrative-functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("roadmap of sun and salt") impress but lack subtextual payoff. Ending neither resolves nor provocatively suspends central conflict, weakening thematic impact about cost of enlightenment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic abstraction ("air hummed with unseen life") creates emotional distance. Prose occasionally turns purple; character thought processes feel diagrammatic rather than lived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outweighs execution; elements serve as allegorical puzzle pieces rather than organic narrative drivers. Length exacerbates underdeveloped transitions between reality/幻想.</comment>
