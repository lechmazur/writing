<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation for wisdom is clear and consistent, but lacks emotional depth and nuanced internal conflict, making him more of a philosophical cipher than a fully-realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Pacing is measured but occasionally stagnant; the plot's epiphanic structure works within the word limit, but lacks visceral tension or narrative surprises to fully satisfy traditional arc expectations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Petrified forest's symbolic and sensory details (stone trees, frozen patterns) create immersive atmosphere; the setting's duality with the schematic enhances thematic cohesion and character introspection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Offers thoughtful exploration of philosophical duality, but struggles between poetic abstraction and concrete emotional engagement; thematic impact is undercut by underdeveloped psychological realism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through conceptual blending of philosophy and physics, but contains predictable phrases ("moves like a whisper") and occasionally relies on abstract description over concrete originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; length feels restrictive rather than purposeful; the ending leaves intellectual residue but lacks lasting emotional resonance.</comment>
