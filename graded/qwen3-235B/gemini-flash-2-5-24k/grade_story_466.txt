<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is described but lacks depth; motivation is vague and not emotionally resonant. Actions feel plot-driven rather than psychologically consistent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with a clear arc, but transitions—particularly from grocery shopping to the tower—feel abrupt and underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and atmospheric decay effectively immerse the reader, though some descriptions border on generic. Setting enhances the theme of forgotten knowledge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphors and symbolism enriches the narrative, though emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. The ending ties back to the theme but lacks visceral resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept (seed packets as linguistic keys) is fresh, but character tropes and some overly familiar phrases (e.g., “morally ambiguous”) weaken uniqueness. Language remains purposeful but occasionally ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Most elements integrate cohesively, though the abrupt shift from grocery shopping to the tower disrupts flow. The brief length is deliberate but exposes pacing tensions.</grade><comment></comment>
