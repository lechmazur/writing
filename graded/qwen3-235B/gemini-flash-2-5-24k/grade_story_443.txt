<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character development is overly abstract; motivations are conveyed through metaphor rather than concrete psychology. Minimal emotional specificity undermines authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but relies on vague cause-effect relationships. The arc is conceptual rather than dramatically earned, feeling loosely assembled.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is impeccably rendered with sensory details, but some elements (like migrating bird's seeds) lack thematic integration within the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective literary devices (extended metaphor in manuscript) deepen themes, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract introspection rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some passages risk poetic self-indulgence ("fearful joy") and rely on archetypal grief/rebirth tropes without subverting them. Near-purple prose in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements combine thematically but lack narrative urgency. The brevity works conceptually but sacrifices emotional gravity in execution.</comment>
