<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth; motivations are clear but reactions lack nuanced exploration of agoraphobia's psychological complexity. The 'voice' is stylistically consistent but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tightly structured within constraints, but the shift from discovery to apocalyptic tension feels abrupt. Pacing is deliberate but resolution lacks follow-through on the crack's implications.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive; rain/record player contrast and dunes' sentient whispers create layered sensory and symbolic texture that enhances both character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor and thematic coherence around freedom vs. responsibility, but emotional impact is muted by overly explicit exposition rather than organic revelation through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subverts 'cursed heirloom' trope with creative execution. Avoids purple prose but occasionally drifts into abstract descriptors ("realistically fanciful mechanism") that lack precise tangible grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully integrated but not fully transcendent. The constraint-driven structure sacrifices some character depth but preserves thematic resonance and atmospheric originality.</comment>
