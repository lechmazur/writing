<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's politeness shapes her actions well, but her depth as an understudy sorcerer remains superficial; motivations are clear but lack psychological complexity or personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plot is constrained to a single scene with minimal progression; the method of dampening whispers is coherent but lacks narrative momentum or transformation within the tight limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt chamber's shimmering texture and laundry sounds create a unique atmosphere, but the connection between the mundane and arcane elements feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of "waking the unheard" offers intellectual intrigue, but emotional resonance is muted; metaphors (e.g., tsunami analogy) elevate the prose, yet the ending lacks thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blending of magic (salt crystals) and industrial laundromats is inventive; avoids clich√©s but occasionally slips into overly ornate descriptions, risking "purple prose."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively links its elements and suggests a larger world, though its constrained scope leaves thematic exploration somewhat shallow; effective as a vignette but not profoundly layered.</comment>
