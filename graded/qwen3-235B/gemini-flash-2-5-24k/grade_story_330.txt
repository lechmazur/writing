<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation and object connection clear, but minimal personality beyond dejection and duty; lacks emotional complexity or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive progression through setting and action, but limited emotional arc due to brevity; cause-effect logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly rendered with vivid, sensory paradoxes; sacred disorder and zero-gravity setting evoke immersive, surreal tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors deepen themes, but emotional impact diluted by abstract detachment; ending resonates conceptually more than emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on ornate phrasing (e.g., 'deepening horizons') that risks obscuring genuine emotional nuance; originality tempered by stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive fusion of elements, though reliance on poetic abstraction over character depth weakens human resonance; conceptual ambition outweighs stylistic restraint.</comment>
