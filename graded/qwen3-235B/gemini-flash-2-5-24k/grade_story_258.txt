<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits are connected to plot actions, but emotional interiority remains underdeveloped beyond stated motivations. The "jaded wonder" attribute needs more behavioral specificity to justify her relentless drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression towards deadline-driven objective, but the condensed structure sacrifices meaningful setbacks or evolving stakes that would create narrative momentum beyond the symbolic final leaf.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Driftwood island setting creates intriguing visual and tactile texture, but atmospheric elements like the "physically metaphysical" remain conceptually abstract rather than visceral through sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but unevenly in emotional execution. The concise format obscures rather than enhances thematic tension between urgency and contemplative ritual.</comment>
