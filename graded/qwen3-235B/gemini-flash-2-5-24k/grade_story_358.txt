<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Promising motivation but lacks depth in humanizing Elias. The "old-fashioned mage" trope remains underexplored beyond surface details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolic action (cuddling dread) drives the narrative, but suffers from lack of concrete resolution within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is compellingly crafted through sensory contrasts and "playground time," but the arctic greenhouse setting's thematic relevance remains underarticulated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and existential themes resonate, though explicit emotional descriptors occasionally undercut subtler horror elements. The ending's lingering tension works well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through unexpected juxtapositions (high concept with tactile details), though some phrases ("sanctified dread") verge on overused territory. The mirror method feels original and integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High overall cohesion despite ambitious element density. The frontier theme emerges clearly but requires tighter narrative economy to reach prestige-tier polish.</comment>
