<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and evocative, but motivation lacks sufficient psychological complexity; "logically emotional" concept remains underexplored despite surface references</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through cohesive cause-effect, but the word limit strains narrative resolution; overreach action drives momentum yet feels rushed</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (scent of jasmine) create immersive atmosphere, but "whispering gallery" remains underexploited as setting; tonal contrast between grandiosity and modesty is inconsistently maintained</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical language (survival as art/mapping as defiance) resonates emotionally; ending's tension between hope and doom achieves memorable poignancy</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively yet unevenly; atmospheric components outpace psychological depth; brief length sacrifices character complexity for poetic abstraction</comment>
