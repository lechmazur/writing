<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to overcome prejudice via abstract confrontation lacks tangible personal stakes or psychological depth; her profession is conceptually relevant but under-explored in shaping her character beyond thematic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows an arc of symbolic barrier-breaking, but cause/effect between the phantom punch's introduction and resolution is underdeveloped; pacing feels rushed, with the word limit weakening emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport's decay is evocatively rendered through tactile details (dust, cool metal) that mirror societal prejudice; atmosphere effectively supports thematic resonance despite sparse worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (phantom punch as dismantling prejudice) are conceptually strong, but emotional impact leans intellectual over visceral; the ending's thematic payoff is clear but lacks layered subtext for deeper engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique profession/setting blend, but abstract concepts (e.g., "phantom barriers") occasionally veer into vague symbolism; tone remains consistent, though some phrases ("ancient novelty") feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceably integrated but occasionally strain coherence (e.g., disconnected farmer's market backstory); the story demonstrates thematic ambition but sacrifices emotional specificity for abstraction.</comment>
