<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape simulation is clear, but lacks depth in how "grim sentinel" role shapes identity beyond isolation. Voice remains abstract rather than viscerally personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loop structure and coin-melody method create tension, but lacks arc or progression within word limit. Breakthrough moment feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town's sensory details (dust motes, coin hum) create strong atmosphere, but simulation mechanics remain vague. Contrast between grey town and green pamphlet image enhances mood effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (melodies as code, memories as stones) add depth. Emotional resonance somewhat undercut by heavy abstraction; ending establishes lingering tension rather than resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Simulation-escape trope subverted through coin-melody method. Occasional overly poetic phrasing ("single note in silent score") borders on purple prose. Concept execution feels more atmospheric than logically rigorous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively thematically but lack narrative urgency. Short length works thematically but sacrifices character/narrative payoff. Lingering concept strength outweighs execution flaws.</comment>
