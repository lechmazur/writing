<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character serves as thematic vessel rather than human entity; motivation is clear but underdeveloped, with actions feeling abstract rather than emotionally resonant; lacks psychological depth or organic growth, existing primarily to embody the concept of defiance against decay.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as cyclical observation without progression or tension; repetitive motion between weathervane and album fragments narrative flow, creating stasis over organic development; lacks traditional arc or resolution despite attempts to imply progression through celestial mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually arresting and immersive atmosphere with precise, vivid imagery (burning comet, skeletal branches) that amplifies tone and thematic concerns of decay/rebirth; sensory details occasionally verge on overwhelming but successfully create a haunting, unforgettable setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric framework surrounding resilience and translation, but lacks emotional immediacy; employs literary devices effectively yet feels intellectually distant; subtext about encoded natural memory is compelling, but thematic exploration remains surface-level without visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original premise with poetic potential, but frequently slips into ornate abstraction rather than purposeful imagery; repetitive phrase structures ("throughout moving") and overly conceptual language detract from narrative authenticity; unique but at risk of being mistaken for algorithmic elaboration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not dramatically; brevity is both strength (concentration of image) and weakness (lack of narrative momentum); clever integration of components like weathervane/orchard interplay, yet leaves lingering sense of conceptual blueprint over lived experience.</comment>
