<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's psychic ability informs her actions but lacks depth beyond plot function; motivation hinted at but not fully explored; "proudly humble" trait feels stated rather than embodied through specific behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear trajectory trapped-to-dice-roll maintains minimal coherence but feels compressed; cause-effect between diaries and dice manipulation remains underdeveloped; pacing uneven with abrupt shifts between backstory and present moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Brig's cold metal and engine hum establish minimal atmosphere; sensory details exist but lack distinctiveness; "grave playfulness" tone inconsistently maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (chipped die as imperfect fate) and symbolic layering of legacy/time; ending achieves thematic resonance but emotional impact diluted by exposition; theme of manipulating fate shows potential but remains partially realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (genealogist in space, bullet trains in void) but leans on space pirate tropes; avoids purple prose but occasionally relies on familiar emotional descriptors; transitions generally smooth but contains potentially AI-like generalizations about "cosmic gamble."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements mostly present but unevenly integrated; brevity often feels restrictive; creative potential in psychic research through abandoned objects underutilized; lingering questions about fate's malleability lack payoff.</comment>
