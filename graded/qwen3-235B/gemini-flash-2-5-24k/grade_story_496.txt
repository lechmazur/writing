<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's poetic conflict is internally consistent but lacks distinct voice; motivation for cosmic verse feels hinted but underexplored. Reaction to the bottle reveals obsession, but psychological depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sudden ambush propels action but feels truncated; spontaneous decision to explore lacks psychological causality. Plot coherence suffers from condensed pacing—beginning's atmospheric build clashes with abrupt, unresolved climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid decay permeates every description; sensory details (damp earth, absolute silence) immerse readers. The reclaimed city's overgrowth becomes an active force, symbiotic with the bottle's otherworldly ink to amplify existential tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Liminal beauty juxtaposed with visceral danger creates lingering unease. Metaphors ("canvas became trap") resonate thematically, though ending's abruptness undercuts emotional resolution. Subtext of artistic creation as self-annihilation remains compellingly unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original cosmic verse premise avoids genre clichés but exhibits occasional overwrought phrasing ("dreaming heart"). Ambush choreography feels human rather than algorithmic, though some existential musings border on solipsistic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock with intentional thematic synergy (bottle's ink as both artistic salvation/physical threat), though tight word count weakens character psychology. Style prioritizes poetic atmosphere over narrative closure, leaving lingering questions that feel purposefully haunting.</comment>
