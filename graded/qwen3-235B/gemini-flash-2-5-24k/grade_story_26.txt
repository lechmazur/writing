<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth in exploring his emotional or psychological complexity beyond obsession. Actions align with motivation but remain surface-level in conveying interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear structure (preparation, climax, resolution), but pacing feels slightly rushed in the critical moment of animation. Logical flow is maintained, though the radio broadcast's significance is under-integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (neon light, hum of machinery) create a vivid cyberpunk mood. The setting's connection to the DNA method feels underexplored, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (DNA as "language of creation") and symbolism (floating form as externalized shame). Ending delivers thematic resonance, but abstract concepts occasionally strain believability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Combines cyberpunk and bio-organic elements in a fresh way, but the DNA mechanism leans on vague "hidden patterns" without scientific/philosophical meat. Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven (e.g., neon orchard's energy feeds the animation). Narrative feels purposefully condensed, leaving a haunting impression of redemption through technical/artistic obsession.</comment>
