<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's vigilance as an orchardist isn't deeply intertwined with cipher methods; sardonic glee feels under-explored despite frequent mentions. Motivation tied to personal tragedy has emotional weight but lacks visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within tight word limits, but rushed explanations during the climax dilute tension. Flight data/feather parallels require more incremental buildup to avoid feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting's potential as a whimsical-conspiratorial juxtaposition is underdeveloped. Sensory details about paper gliders, iridescence, and the hangar's atmosphere are sporadic rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thematic depth in "patterns vs. chaos" resonates, elevated by the feather's paradoxical beauty-as-evidence. Some expository lumps in dialogue/dialogue-equivalent weaken showing-over-telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through eccentric premise, but "sardonic glee" and "illicit transfers" verge on pulp. Unique voice balances on the edge of overwrought symbolism without crossing into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fascinating fragments (feather code, obsessive logic) coexist with undercooked elements (tragedy backstory, villain specifics). The whole feels like a prologue to a larger narrative rather than a self-contained triumph.</comment>
