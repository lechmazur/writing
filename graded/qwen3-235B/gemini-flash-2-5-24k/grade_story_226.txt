<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character defined by task and pride, but lacks emotional depth beyond obsession. Motivation is consistent but under-explored. No distinct voice due to third-person narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Procedural plot structure driven by capture process, but lacks tension or arc. Pacing controlled yet static. Ends where it begins, missing a sense of change.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich with tactile details (skull's coolness, sterile equipment). Atmosphere leans on metaphor over realism. Blends melancholy and mysticism effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and philosophical undertones (artificial vs. authentic) present, but emotional engagement is limited. Ending maintains tone but avoids thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids clichés. Language occasionally veers into ornate phrasing, but surreal logic and unique metaphors (cultivating silence, spectral seeds) elevate creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements tightly interwoven but story’s brevity prioritizes atmosphere over deeper thematic exploration. Leverages constraints for haunting vignette effect rather than feeling truncated.</comment>
