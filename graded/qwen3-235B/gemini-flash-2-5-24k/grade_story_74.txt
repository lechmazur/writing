<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character consistent but underdeveloped; motivation clear yet lacks emotional depth beyond surface rebellion. "Aloofly intimate" concept underexploited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherent with logical progression, but ends abruptly without resolving broader implications of "turn of the tide," weakening narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Primordial atmosphere vividly realized through sensory details; setting meaningfully connects to themes of AI control and pre-technological purity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (joker, sequence) and subtext about resistance; ending resonates thematically but sacrifices character specificity for abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "AI dystopia" trope without sufficient innovation; language is purposeful but occasionally veers into stylized detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements fit together logically, but thematic weight feels unevenly distributed; premise is intriguing but resolution lacks visceral impact.</comment>
