<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's role as a divine-channeling DJ shapes her actions, but her inner life remains underdeveloped beyond mystical rituals and tools.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear progression maps sacred spaces efficiently, but the tight word limit leaves little room for narrative tension or transformation beyond the revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone, charcoal, synthetic night) create a hallucinatory atmosphere that deepens the sacred-mapping concept, though some elements verge on ornamental.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "borrowed starlight") and symbolic use of music/geometry elevate the story, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise (DJ-channeling, thread-guided mapping) avoids clich√©s, though occasional purple prose ("humid air...latent energy") risks formulaic mysticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid cohesion under constraints, but the story leans heavily on exotic trappings rather than profound thematic exploration of divinity/space.</comment>
