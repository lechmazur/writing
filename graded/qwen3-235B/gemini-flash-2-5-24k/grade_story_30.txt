<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving farming) is clear and drives action, but internal conflict between pirate/farmer identities could deepen. Telekinesis is pragmatic, not just a gimmick, but personality/voice remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single dice-roll action creates tight structure. Plot coherence maintained despite constraints; beginning/middle/end clear through gambling arc. Pacing is urgent but some exposition strains flow. Flame motif and tapestry clues provide thematic throughlines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Sacred disorder" atmosphere excels through tactile details (bone dice, flickering consoles). Pirate navigation room and whispered secrets create immersive tension. Tapestry-dragons watching adds mysticism. Sensory details specific but slightly uneven in supporting plot stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elicits tension through cosmic stakes. Strong motif use (flame, tree-planting as literal/metaphorical acts). Subtext about cultural preservation vs. survival capitalism shines. Ending ambiguity preserves thematic weight. Overdescription occasionally dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts space opera tropes with agrarian preservation angle. Avoids "chosen one" arcs by framing Kaelen as desperate pragmatist. Metaphors (tapestry as code, trees as living archives) feel fresh. No purple prose; emotional nuance shown through ritual (tree-planting) rather than telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration impressively cohesive: each serves dual purpose (e.g., telekinesis enables gambling which funds conservation). Timeframe compression focuses narrative. Lingering questions about lost languages' utility prevent higher score. Technical execution nearly flawless.</comment>
