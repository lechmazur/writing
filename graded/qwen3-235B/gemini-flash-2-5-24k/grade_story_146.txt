<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation to study sacred development is present but abstract; peaceful anger lacks nuanced integration into actions. Assigned attribute shapes character minimally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression: exploration of symbols without conflict, stakes, or resolution. Pacing static; no clear arc within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (dust, brittle scrolls) create immersive atmosphere. Bone flute and archive setting cohere, but planting season contrast remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (flute as "key") add depth, but themes remain diffuse. Ending lacks emotional resonance; tension between sacred truth and deception hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on poetic abstraction over narrative specificity. "Peaceful anger" feels contrived; some ornate phrasing verges on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements like archive and flute work, but others (planting season, "regularly seldom") feel forced. Conceptual themes overwhelm plot brevity; cohesion sacrifices.</comment>
