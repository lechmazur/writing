<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich (dutiful yet jaded) and motivation is thematic, but emotional interiority remains somewhat abstract and generalized rather than deeply embodied through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sparse prose allows tight focus on linear puzzle-solving arc, but pivotal transitions (glove's function, compartment discovery) rely on convenience of coincidence rather than organic cause-effect. Resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary's sensory details (cracked glove texture, stifled coughs' negative space) masterfully create sacred-decay atmosphere that mirrors dying charge's scavenger hunt as artistic performance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors crystallize thematic unity (voice notes as mortality-defiance, glove as metaphor for imperfect connection), with ending's "absurd instruction" subverting sentimental farewells through elegantly minimalist craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unexpected technical specificity (cracked phone voices, glove's stitching pattern) but occasionally lapses into ornamental description ("graceless beauty" repetition). Nuanced emotional undercurrents elevate beyond formula.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>All elements mechanically cohere, but "auditions" timeframe remains superficially integrated. Conceptual ambition ("death as creative act") transcends plot mechanics, though compressed form obscures character depth.</comment>
