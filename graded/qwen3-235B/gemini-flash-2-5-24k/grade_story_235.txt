<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals; motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally distant. The herbalist's interiority remains opaque despite poetic descriptions of their actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Minimal plot progression; relies on thematic resonance over narrative momentum. Open-endedness works thematically but lacks structural tension or resolution within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative but occasionally generic imagery (stone halls, mountain flora) creates atmosphere, though sensory details lack specific, memorable textures that would fully immerse readers in the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sophisticated use of metaphor and subtext elevates the narrative. While emotionally restrained, the symbolic parallels between celestial patterns and human connection create lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original approach to silent communication through botanical and cosmic symbolism avoids formulaic structures, though occasional ornate phrasing risks veering into self-conscious lyricism rather than authentic emotional exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel like a polished vignette rather than fully realized narrative. Conceptual cleverness and poetic language compensate for structural brevity rather than embracing it as an artistic choice.</comment>
