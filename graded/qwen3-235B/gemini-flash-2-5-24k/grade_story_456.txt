<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High concept density suffocates character depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through action; static personality revealed through excessive description instead of choices; trait "neutrally passionate intensity" feels contradictory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Pseudo-plot formed through environmental accretion rather than forward motion; no clear narrative arc or resolution; cyclical theme attempts to mask structural aimlessness; cause/effect relationships between discoveries and character transformation remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive atmosphere through persistent sensory decay motif; setting operates as existential mirror to protagonist's preoccupations; candle as extinction metaphor integrates seamlessly with lantern's dying light as temporal marker.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stylistic command evident in thematic symbolism (candle, decaying papers) but undercut by overworked phrases; cyclical structure creates conceptual resonance though lacks emotional payoff; tension between secrecy and revelation implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s through specific philosophical focus but occasionally lapses into aestheticized depression tropes; metaphors precise rather than predictable; self-conscious lyricism borders on purple prose; emotional landscape remains intellectualized rather than viscerally rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Compelling thematic unity achieved through recurring symbols but sacrifices narrative momentum; brevity emphasizes atmosphere over character progression; element integration feels calculated rather than organic; lingering intellectual impression outweighs emotional resonance.</comment>
