<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation is stated but not emotionally or psychologically grounded. Chess background unconnected to actions. Tropish surface traits without nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work but feel contrived. Abrupt transitions (confetti swirl, wall click) lack buildup. Pacing uneven but contained within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes contrast between sterile farm and ancient tunnels, but xenophobic workers lack contextual integration. Sensory details present but occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery occasionally striking ("dusk-lit confetti"), but subtext thin. Ending serves as placeholder rather than thematic resolution. Relies on "showing" without emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Combines tropes (lone seeker, magical puzzle) predictably. The "agonizing bliss" phrasing strains for poetry. Prose occasionally overwrought; setting lacks cultural/political specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but thematically underdeveloped. Short length emphasizes thinness of conceptual scaffolding rather than enhancing it for artistic effect.</comment>
