<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to scientific curiosity is clear, but the "inwardly social" trait isn't sufficiently manifested through actions or voice. Emotional range remains limited despite visceral descriptions. The exorcist background lacks concrete manifestations beyond tremors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying mechanical progression through puzzles, but the connection between dance lessons and supernatural activity remains underdeveloped. Time compression works structurally but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration of the timeframe element.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere utilizes contrasting levels (dance above/sub-basement below) effectively, but sensory details lean on familiar tropes (ozone/smoke). The psychic facility setting feels generically New Age rather than specific to the story's unique vision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Successfully creates intellectual tension through puzzles as filters, but emotional engagement remains cerebral rather than visceral. The theme of merging science with the occult lacks philosophical depth, relying primarily on atmospheric contrasts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subverts exorcist tropes by emphasizing scientific rigor over supernatural combat. Avoids clich√©s in puzzle design but occasionally defaults to gothic adjectives for the "psychic research" setting. The coy aggression tone exists but isn't distinctively rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Idea density sometimes overwhelms cohesion, particularly in connecting dance lessons to paranormal energy spikes. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution scope, though all elements function in service of the narrative rather than feeling imposed.</comment>
