<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivations align consistently with her introverted empath trait, and her actions reinforce her unique method of healing. However, character depth remains surface-level beyond abstract emotional resonance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative has a clear beginning-mid-end structure with symbolic progression, but the tight arc feels engineered rather than organic. Pacing works within constraints but lacks narrative tension</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Detailed sensory elements establish atmosphere effectively, but the setting's space pirate context remains superficial. Connections between atmosphere and character actions feel inconsistently developed</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphors (marionette as collective psyche) elevates thematic depth. Writing style shows literary craftsmanship, though emotional showing often gives way to poetic telling</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original approach to healing narrative with unique symbolism, but contains overused elements ("echoes of souls," "collective psyche"). Some phrases lean toward ornate abstraction rather than grounded originality</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through thematic throughlines, though some assigned elements feel like conceptual scaffolding rather than organically integrated story components. Leaves a philosophical impression but lacks visceral impact</comment>
