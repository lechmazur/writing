<question>1</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Weak emotional grounding for motivation; sudden disappearance lacks psychological plausibility despite brooding setup; character voice shows promise but remains mostly internalized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure but feels truncated; the "dance of dust" method undermines narrative logic; abrupt disappearance lacks satisfying cause-effect chain despite atmospheric momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Superficial blending of high-concept setting with mundane details; ozone/dust imagery works but crater's "strange energies" remain unexplored worldbuilding potential; car washing feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (dust motes as "ephemeral stars") create haunting closure; emotional impact diluted by underdeveloped conflict-resolution arc; atmosphere overshadows character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stylized prose occasionally lapses into synthetic cadences ("murky tenderness", "webs of intrigue"); escape method borrows tired mystical tropes; emotional beats rely overly on stated "sorrow" rather than demonstrated subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically interconnected; brevity constraints apparent; atmospheric fragments compensate for underdeveloped thematic exploration.</comment>
