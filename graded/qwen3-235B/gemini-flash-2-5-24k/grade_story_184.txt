<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ties loosely to her actions, but her "scrappy" nature lacks grounding in specific history or consequences. The shells reveal her longing, but her core self remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows from ritual to reflection, but stakes and progression are nebulous. The ending circles back without substantive arc; cohesion exists but lacks tension or urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (-40°C vacuum chill, percussive shells) anchor the ethereal concept. Time reversal contrasts with fossilized remnants, but integration of "scrappy" tavern-hand aesthetic into the garden feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (shells as imagination keys, footprints as rebellion) elevate the narrative. Ending resonates thematically but risks preciousness; subtext about controlling chaos is poignant yet understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but flirts with purple prose ("flippant solemnity," "mourning percussion"). Sensory details feel calculated rather than organic; concept feels fresh but occasionally self-consciously "literary."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively but prioritize poetic abstraction over emotional urgency. The vignette form suits meditative tone, yet story’s refusal to concretize risks leaving readers adrift.</comment>
