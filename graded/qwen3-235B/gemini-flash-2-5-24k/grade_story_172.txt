<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (outrunning prophecy) is clear, and the transformation into accidental heroism is evident, but the voice lacks distinctiveness and emotional depth that would fully justify the drastic shift in actions. Nuances of desperation feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc, with reversed wishes driving alignment of the box leading to containment of the prophecy. Cause-effect is logical, but the rapid shift from selfishness to sacrifice within the word limit feels slightly truncated despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting uses tactile details (cool wood, humid air) effectively, and the seashell’s amplification of energy creates atmospheric tension. Connection between the box’s architecture and the shell’s structure is evocative, but environmental immersion lacks full sensory integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like “prophecy as sea mist” and the paradox of reversed wishing add literary depth. The twist—selfish action becoming sacrifice—is clever, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract telling over showing, particularly in the protagonist’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through the unconventional reversed-wish mechanism and self-sacrificial twist, but phrasing like “sharp gentleness” and “architectural secrets” borders on vague abstraction. Some lines lean into poetic vagueness over precise, individualized voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly: the box and reversed wishes directly enable the protagonist’s arc, while the seashell serves as both setting and symbolic amplifier. The concise format sacrifices some emotional grounding but maintains thematic focus on sacrifice and containment.</comment>
