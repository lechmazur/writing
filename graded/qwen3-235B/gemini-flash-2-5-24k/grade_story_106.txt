<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's sullenness is established but lacks depth; motivation is clear yet feels overly simplistic. Transformation via quilt symbolism exists but lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed; the leap from despair to action relies on convenient inspiration. Pacing balances brevity and coherence but strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Underwater power station is vividly contrasting; sensory details like bioluminescence and dampness enhance mood. Stamps and quilt effectively juxtapose surface/depth themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (quilt as hope, stamps as borrowed lives) elevate the narrative. Ending avoids closure, favoring thematic resonance over emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("fragile spark in the deep") borders on purple prose. Concept avoids clich√©s but risks feeling overly schematic in its symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically tight narrative despite word constraints. The brief length amplifies the focus on transformation-as-process over explicit resolution.</comment>
