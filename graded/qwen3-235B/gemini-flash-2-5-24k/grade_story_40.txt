<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from stagnation to inciting incident with atmospheric urgency, though resolution feels slightly rushed. The arc is cohesive but could better utilize word constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively around existential rebellion theme. Story feels purposeful within brevity but sacrifices some character/textual exploration.</comment>
