<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Predictable, static motivations with minimal psychological complexity; character's guarded nature lacks nuance beyond solitary preservationist archetype.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrases (e.g., "subconscious echoes") verge on purple prose; character logic prioritizes symbolism over human psychology; metaphors recur without fresh subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesive mood but shallow thematic development; assigned elements serve atmospheric purposes without deep integration into narrative or character.</comment>
