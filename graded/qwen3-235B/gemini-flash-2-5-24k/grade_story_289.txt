<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's brainy attribute effectively manifests in her math-driven art, and the doll reveals emotional depth. Motivation aligns well with actions, but her voice lacks distinctiveness despite introspective third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The action of enforcing presence through art propels the plot. Pacing feels deliberate, and the story achieves a clear arc within the word limit. Cause/effect relationships regarding her realization about strength in weakness are logically structured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay establishes vivid visual atmosphere and meaningfully informs the ephemeral-street-art method. While sensory details support the tone, underutilization of non-visual senses slightly weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance emerges through symbolism (porcelain doll, transient art) and the theme of ephemerality. The ending delivers satisfying thematic closure. However, the reflective tone occasionally prioritizes concept over visceral emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original integration of ideas (e.g., sci-fi street art) avoids clichés. Literary devices are fresh and purposeful, with minimal purple prose. The doll’s nuanced emotional function and the paradox of "awkward elegance" showcase creative depth without formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>All elements coalesce into a thematically unified narrative. The brief length enhances focus on introspection. The story lingers through its philosophical undertones, though its quiet emotional tone may lack immediate punch compared to more dynamic closures.</comment>
