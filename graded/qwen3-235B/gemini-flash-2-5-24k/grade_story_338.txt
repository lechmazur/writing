<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's zany detachment and pursuit of beauty in the mundane are conceptually clear but lack emotional depth or distinct voice; motivations are consistent but underexplored beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional progression but maintains coherence through cyclical structure; method of analyzing call logs drives static narrative effectively but fails to create meaningful arc or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting and time folds create strong surreal atmosphere with some vivid decay imagery, but sensory details remain unevenly developed; atmosphere supports themes more than grounding immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and theme; poetic language and exploration of abstraction carry emotional weight, though sparse character voice weakens connection; ending reinforces thematic consistency rather than narrative impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept executed without clich√© but occasionally slips into ornate description; ideas feel fresh but risk abstraction overexecution; avoids predictable tropes while occasionally losing human nuance in prose flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack transformative synergy; style serves thematic intent yet limits emotional resonance; brevity feels both deliberate and inherently restrictive for deeper engagement.</comment>
