<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but not deeply explored; motivation of "fervent apathy" lacks nuanced execution, actions feel repetitive without revealing layered psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single-action loop dominates with limited narrative progression; cause-effect logic is clear but lacks structural complexity or satisfying closure within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually haunting elements (bones, VR conduits) create atmosphere but underdeveloped sensory immersion; setting-object connections exist without maximal exploitation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (fan as anchor) and thematic tension (oath vs. apathy) elevate impact, but repetitive cycles and static resolution weaken emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique hybridity (scarecrow/Virtual Reality) and crisp prose, though some descriptors ("realistically fantastical") lean generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative momentum; brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate, leaving conceptual potential unrealized.</comment>
