<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elías's motivation to let go of spectral visions aligns consistently with his actions, and his elegantly clumsy trait is shown through physical interactions, but deeper emotional layers of his personal history could strengthen his arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc of observation → engagement → resolution, but the word limit occasionally strains exposition of causal links (e.g., how elevator repair ties to his spectral work).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lab’s preserved-sand aesthetic creates a poignant metaphor for ghosts’ stagnation, with strong sensory details (e.g., brittle petals), though the setting’s tactile and auditory potential feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "spectral noise" and the flower crown’s symbolism are poignant, and the ending’s thematic payoff is satisfying, but some emotions are stated rather than shown (e.g., "ache," "sorrow").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise avoids tropes by framing ghosts as sorrowful rather than horrific, but phrases like "spectral physics" risk veering toward overly abstract or flowery language without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with the lab’s preserved past reinforcing themes, but the elevator repair job feels loosely connected to the central conflict, weakening narrative unity.</comment>
