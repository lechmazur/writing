<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character; motivations are implied but not fully embodied through action or internal conflict. Voice remains inconsistent with alchemical lore.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Meandering structure relies on disconnected events without clear causality; the abrupt shifts between symbols weaken narrative arc cohesion within the limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unsettling contrast between suburbia and industrial decay creates vivid, original atmosphere. Sensory details (sulfur, trembling coin) effectively immerse reader in uncanny tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Simmering mysticism and layered metaphors (kinship as "web," time as organic process) evoke intrigue, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on abstract imagery over concrete human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique setting combinations, but "chain-reactive coincidences" risk artificiality. Tone remains distinct despite occasional ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story's premise is intriguing but feels constrained by its own density; elements exist in proximity rather than synergy. Lingers as an unsettling sketch rather than a fully realized revelation.</comment>
