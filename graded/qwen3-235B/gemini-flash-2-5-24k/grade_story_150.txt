<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks concrete motivation/actions; the philosophical drive remains abstract, and the cowboy-poet duality isn't fully embodied in specific decisions or reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Meanders without clear structural progression; the rehearsals framework lacks rising action or resolution, and the dice-reading method feels disconnected from plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Steampunk elements are visually present but inconsistently integrated; cosmic and mechanical imagery create compelling contrasts, but sensory details are uneven (e.g., steam hissing but no tactile heat/texture).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of existential pattern-seeking are intriguing but remain superficial; relies heavily on telling ("saturated ambivalence") rather than showing emotional complexity or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by formulaic phrases ("saturated ambivalence," "six-shooter and sonnet") and abstract descriptions substituting for tangible character/plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Coherent in tone but sacrifices narrative urgency for atmospherics; elements are creatively combined but feel more decorative than thematically essential.</comment>
