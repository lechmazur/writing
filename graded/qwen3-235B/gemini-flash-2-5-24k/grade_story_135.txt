<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation in preserving dialects drives actions, but emotional depth remains underexplored. Character voice lacks distinctiveness, though loyalty to fading languages aligns consistently with behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Static plot structure maintains coherence but lacks progression or resolution. Action (deciphering bruises) is consistent but serves as a singular repeated act rather than a developing plot. Pacing avoids rushed execution but fails to build narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory atmosphere with cold, decay, and mechanical sounds enhances mood. Frozen harbor setting enriches thematic tension between tradition/ephemerality. Object (straw/poster) connection effective but missed opportunities to further integrate brewery’s role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (poster as linguistic map) and themes (cultural erasure) are conceptually strong. Lacks emotional resonance due to static character/narrative. Ending maintains thematic consistency without resolving tension, prompting reflection. Prose occasionally overwrites sensory details without deeper narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in interpreting 'lost paths' via linguistic archaeology. Avoids clichés through unique methods (metal straw/bruises). Some ornate phrasing risks redundancy, but imaginative premise and nuanced tone avoid formulaic structures. Emotional reactions shown through environment/rituals rather than stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</comment>Story’s cohesion relies tightly on assigned elements but feels constrained by brevity. Elements support thematic depth but lack narrative payoff expected by demanding literary standards. Style avoids excessive ornament but leaves impact shallow due to word limit; would benefit from more textured character/plot interplay.</comment>
