<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's traits are stated but lack depth; motivations are clear but not fully embodied through action or conflict, leaving her persona more conceptual than experiential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a static ritual structure; the action lacks progression or stakes, though the story’s tight focus aligns with the word limit, with coherence maintained through atmospheric continuity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (salt, tarnished brass) and the lighthouse’s haunting isolation create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that mirrors Elara’s emotional and metaphysical struggles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative prose and metaphysical symbolism elevate the story; however, the thematic weight of isolation and futility is undercut by a lack of emotional urgency in the resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original use of psychic canyons and humbly arrogant characterization avoids genre clichés; some phrases lean into ornate abstraction, slightly diluting otherwise fresh metaphysical concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a moody vignette, but the story leans too heavily on abstraction; its brevity serves atmosphere but limits narrative momentum or transformative impact.</comment>
