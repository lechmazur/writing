<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation clear but character lacks depth beyond assigned traits; emotional nuance minimal despite consistent hesitancy shaping actions through plush reliance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression with cohesive beginning/middle, but resolution feels abrupt; assigned elements shape plot yet lack structural complexity within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes mood through sensory details (xenon light, "hum" of grief) but setting-plot integration superficial; timeframe/tone enhance melancholy without deep contextualization.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (tapestry, fragility) and poetic devices elevate emotional weight; theme of healing through recontextualization resonates, though subtext remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original combinations (bard/dream machines) subvert clich√©s, but excessive ornate descriptions ("shyly loud") border on purple prose; emotional resonance feels surface-level despite unique imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but execution uneven; brevity serves as strength in poetic focus yet hinders deeper development or tension.</comment>
