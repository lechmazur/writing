<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's socially awkward nature is evident but remains surface-level; motivation (regret over past failure) is clear but lacks nuanced emotional layers; actions directly align with traits and motivation, but the "hopefully cynical" voice isn't fully embodied in narration or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot revolves around decoding via the whistle, but lacks narrative momentum; cause-effect between sound patterns and decryption is logical but contrived; begins and ends with stagnant progress, missing a satisfying arc; pacing drags in middle sections despite tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Diner setting contrasts effectively with abstract tech-thriller atmosphere; sensory details (whistle's texture, coffee temperature) enhance mood but occasionally veer into overwrought description; forgotten arts concept feels underexplored within the physical and digital spaces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "tree of regret" offer thematic foundation but feel overly explicit; imagery around echoes and sonic manipulation is vivid; ending flicker of progress lacks emotional payoff; tension between hope/cynicism is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Few obvious clich√©s, but atmospheric descriptions occasionally border on purple prose; approach to "reversed trails" shows ingenuity but execution leans abstract; emotional introspection relies partially on stated feelings ("gnawing self-doubt") rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative synergy; the whistle feels organic to the plot while the archive remains a passive backdrop; brief length emphasizes melancholy tone but restricts resolution; conceptually intriguing but execution lacks distinctive impact.</comment>
