<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are clearly defined but lack depth; motivation drives action but feels underexplored beyond surface-level desperation. Nuanced reactions to assigned elements are minimal, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels constrained by the word limit; pacing is effective in key moments, but the connection between the firework timeframe and action lacks sufficient weight to anchor the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mirage oasis has vivid imagery but feels underdeveloped; atmosphere leans too heavily on abstract descriptions (data streams, light constructs) without grounding sensory details to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (e.g., card as hope) and thematic coherence; the ending evokes emotional impact through subtext, though the rapid resolution risks leaving deeper themes underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in xericalizing a system is strong, but some phrasing (e.g., “desperate optimism”) feels forced; avoids major clichés but occasionally veers into abstract, disconnected imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but unevenly integrated; the concept’s complexity feels stifled by the word limit, leaving some assigned components (e.g., gold threads) underutilized despite creative ambition.</comment>
