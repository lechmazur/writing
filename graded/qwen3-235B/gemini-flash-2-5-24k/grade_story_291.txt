<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character has strong symbolic grounding but lacks concrete actions beyond internal monologue; motivation is clear but abstracted into metaphor without deeper textual complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but pacing feels rushed in key moments of escalation; the maze's symbolic resolution aligns with the opening but could benefit from more dynamic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (cotton candy decay, cosmic echoes) create visceral atmosphere but occasionally verge on ornate excess; orchard cat feels tangential to the central narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors and subtextual exploration of prejudice elevate the narrative, though some passages rely on exposition rather than immersive showing of emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbols like the rope and maze are original but cosmic echoes and "calculated wilderness" lean toward abstract vagueness; tone avoids clich√©s but risks self-indulgence in stylized prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story exhibits craftsmanship and thematic cohesion despite occasional narrative gaps; its brevity works for atmosphere but limits deeper character or plot exploration.</comment>
