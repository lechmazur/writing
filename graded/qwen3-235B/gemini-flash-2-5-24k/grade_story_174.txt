<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional nuance. Profession as fireworks designer ties to ephemeral themes but isn't fully integrated into his actions or internal struggle. Regret feels abstract rather than visceral. Frost interaction shows his creativity but doesn't deepen his personality beyond what's stated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression but feels constrained by word limits. The frost-augmentation method drives action but the resolution remains implied rather than dramatized. Pacing is deliberate but lacks tension escalation. Connection between leaf memories and frost patterns feels conceptually sound but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is evocative with strong sensory details (waterfall roar, damp stone, frost texture). Atmosphere supports themes of isolation and transience. Library behind waterfall creates a liminal space that enhances the metaphysical endeavor. Could use more physical specificity in describing the environment beyond mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story relies on strong metaphors (frost as branching time, venation as memory) but emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than viscerally felt. Ending is thematically consistent but lacks catharsis. Writing style is poetic without descending into purple prose, though some phrases verge on clich√© ("paths unfolding").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes despite dealing with regret/paths-not-taken. Fireworks + frost combination feels novel. Sensory details are specific and purposeful. No signs of formulaic transitions or overused metaphors. Emotional subtext is implied through actions rather than stated, with the maple leaf being particularly effective as a concrete symbol.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively but feel over-explained at times. Brief length highlights conceptual beauty but sacrifices narrative urgency. Atmospheric consistency is strong, but the ending's philosophical musing lacks visceral impact. Leaves lingering impression about regret but doesn't fully crystallize its central idea.</comment>
