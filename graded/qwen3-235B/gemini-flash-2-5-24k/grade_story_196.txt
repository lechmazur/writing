<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear (hidden promise driving apathy as camouflage), but internalized tension between traits occasionally lacks nuanced reactions to surroundings that might further reveal his guarded resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Static narrative relies heavily on internal monologue; the "method" of following meteor showers lacks concrete stakes or demonstrated execution, leaving plot momentum unanchored despite strong conceptual throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively sketched (thin air, expectant silence) but sensory details remain sparse; the setting's celestial positioning logically supports the protagonist's mission but could deepen thematic resonance with tactile, visceral descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "spark of defiance" and celestial imagery carry thematic weight; however, emotional beats often lean on abstract assertions ("knowing naivety") rather than fully embodied subtext or revelation through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through introspective subversion of the "tired swordsman" trope; some phrases ("quiet engine beneath his outward indifference") flirt with overworked lyricism, but the fusion of cosmic navigation and personal redemption feels conceptually fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; the constrained scope sacrifices full exploration of the protagonist's past failure and the tangible consequences of his quest, leaving ambition somewhat unmoored.</comment>
