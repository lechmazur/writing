<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character exists as archetypal symbol rather than three-dimensional entity; motivation remains abstract mysticism without concrete psychological grounding. Actions lack specific personal stakes despite thematic consistency with "leap of faith" climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot consists of static contemplation followed by mystical resolution; lacks traditional progression or conflict. Repetitively circular language ("resuscitate," "whispers") creates illusion of movement without actual development. Climax feels preordained rather than earned through narrative mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric garden provides vivid atmospheric contrast between celestial isolation and organic growth. Sensory details excel in spatial metaphors but lack bodily tactile elements. Timeframe "between borrowed books" remains symbolic abstraction rather than functional narrative constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagistic prose creates hauntingly beautiful metaphors that resonate conceptually. Overreliance on paradoxical descriptors ("fiercely gentle," "intimate separation") borders on self-parody. Ending achieves metaphysical transcendence but sacrifices emotional specificity for grandeur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids egregious formulaic patterns but occasionally lapses into poetic abstraction over concrete particularity. Some phrases ("breathing life into ghosts") border on clich√© despite fresh contextual framing. Originality in cosmic artistic process conceptually compelling but execution occasionally uneven between lyrical moments and vague abstractions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ambient power and thematic integrity compensate for structural minimalism. Assigned elements cohere conceptually but unevenly drive narrative momentum. Lingering resonance stems from metaphorical density rather than dramatic arc. Could benefit from sharper focalization and concrete particularity.</comment>
