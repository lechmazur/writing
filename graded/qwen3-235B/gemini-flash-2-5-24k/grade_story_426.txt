<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve folk medicines is clear and consistent, but their "angrily peaceful" attribute lacks deep integration with actions beyond vague descriptors. The cracked teapot symbolizes fragility of knowledge but isn't shown to directly shape their decisions. Minimal dialogue prevents distinct voice development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot feels episodic rather than structured, with repetitive cycles of hacking/running without clear progression. Hacking bizarre playlists drives the method but lacks internal conflict or stakes. Ending circles back to the same routine, creating a closed loop rather than a satisfying arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere of the decayed park creates immersive sensory details (groaning machinery, painted ghosts) that mirror the character's clandestine work. The setting's decay effectively reinforces theme of fading traditions. However, marathon training framing dilutes atmospheric immersion during run-focused passages.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyrical descriptions of the fractured teapot and coded playlists offer symbolic resonance, but emotional impact remains at surface level. The story privileges "telling" over "showing" through frequent psychological labels like "aloof passion" rather than embodied reactions. Ending's quiet triumph feels under-earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing tics but leans on melancholic decay tropes without subverting them. Unconventional playlist hacking shows ingenuity but strains plausibility. Character psychology feels intellectually designed rather than emotionally authentic. Prose balances poeticism and clarity but occasionally veers into portentous abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story juggles many elements that cohere thematically (fragility, secrecy) but struggle structurally. The haunted park and folk medicine drive the strongest narrative currents, while marathon training feels like an extraneous motif. Lingering questions about preservation ethics versus obsession hint at depth but remain underdeveloped.</comment>
