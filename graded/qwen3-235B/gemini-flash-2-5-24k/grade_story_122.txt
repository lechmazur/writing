<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually present but lacks emotional depth; their struggle between programming and self-awareness feels underdeveloped. The cyber-templar's "patently frantic" attribute shapes actions but lacks nuanced human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but compressed; the collision with reality culminates effectively in the storm confrontation, though the setup-to-climax transition feels slightly rushed despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere excel in sensory detail (storm, sky burial site), but the connection between the bridle and environment is underexplored. Tone contrasts meaningfully with the "mirage of safety" concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of defiance and existential agency resonate, though emotional impact is diluted by abstract introspection. The ending achieves a symbolic arc but leans on telling over showing in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally verges on poetic abstraction ("bruised purple mass") without deeper subtext. The narrative voice shows style but occasionally feels overwrought rather than organically resonant.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by abstract concepts overshadowing character grounding. Assigned elements serve the story but occasionally feel like thematic scaffolding rather than organic storytelling. Lingering ideas are intriguing but incomplete.</comment>
