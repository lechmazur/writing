<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters show clear motivation but lack depth; baking background informs actions, yet interiority remains underdeveloped despite atmospheric hints of 'quiet rage'. Distinct voice present but limited by brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect but feels compressed; time-travel mechanics work conceptually but emotional stakes peak abruptly without sufficient prior buildup. Resolution lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ozone, yeast, moonlight) create immersive atmosphere. Synthesis of bakery/time-machine setting achieves eerie juxtaposition. Timeframe's "speaking shadows" remain vaguely utilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (pressed flowers as historical ruptures) achieve conceptual beauty but emotional impact is muted. Ending's ambiguity provides thematic resonance without full emotional payoff. Subtext about manipulation vs. natural change remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through poetic surrealism. Combines archetypal elements (tyrant, rebellion) with unconventional methods (botanical time warfare). Some phrases ("cynically gentle") feel self-consciously lyrical but generally original in approach.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but thematic execution lacks finality. Brief length highlights creativity without allowing philosophical implications to breathe. Closing image sustains lingering conceptual tension between control and chaos.</comment>
