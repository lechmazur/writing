<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character is sketched with emotional resonance through tactile gestures and internal monologue, but motivation feels static rather than evolving organically through action. The pilot's technical background informs his worldview but lacks layered integration with his desperation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Intimate ritual arc creates micro-structure with beginning/middle/end, but pacing unevenly stretches atmospheric description while underdeveloping the pivotal moment of change. Cause-effect logic maintained but emotional payoff compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually striking decay-world fused with synesthetic details—charred serenity as tactile concept, humming stone circles implying dormant energy. Timeframe's impending violence contrasts with stillness, creating taut atmospheric tension through environmental personification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical broadcast-as-ritual introduces philosophical dimension. Ending avoids neat resolution while preserving fragile hope. Subtle showing of transformation through sensory reactions, though thematic undercurrents occasionally surface explicitly rather than emerge organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative phrasing occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction ("horizons of mercy"). Maintains individual style in specific images but contains mechanical constructions ("stone in the gut" trope). Emotional nuance implied through action rather than stated, though some purple prose tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with atmospheric purpose—abandoned observatory mirrors character's detachment, herb ritual transforms technological mindset into primal gesture. Story leverages brevity effectively but requires greater narrative consequence within constraints.</comment>
