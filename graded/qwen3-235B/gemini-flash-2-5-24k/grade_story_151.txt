<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character consistent and motivated by assigned traits, but lacks emotional complexity and distinct narrative voice despite thematic integration of object and method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coheres through tight thematic threads despite brevity; elements serve existential themes more than narrative urgency, leaving some conceptual questions unresolved.</comment>
