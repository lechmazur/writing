<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's meekness and fixation on decoding existence shape her routine, but her inner conflict remains underexplored despite her motivation being consistent. The broken pen's symbolic role is clear, but its connection to her necromancy is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot's structure is linear and complete, but the progression from frustration to revelation feels slightly rushed. The dew-drop method is logically tied to her quest, though the transformation from failure to insight lacks layered tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goblin city's atmosphere is evocative—moisture-starved setting contrasts with her moss patches—but the goblins’ presence feels peripheral. Sensory details (echoes, dryness) enhance mood but fail to deepen the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of the tapestry and light's refraction create resonance, and the ending’s quiet triumph is affecting. However, the emotional weight relies heavily on thematic abstraction rather than visceral engagement with the character’s psyche.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The necromancer’s niche pursuit of simplicity avoids genre tropes, and the broken pen/dew-drop pairing feels fresh. However, phrases like "small miracles" risk cliché, and the tone occasionally flattens into didacticism rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion is strong, with all elements serving its contemplative theme. The brevity enhances focus, though the resolution’s simplicity may lack the narrative punch needed for top-tier distinction.</comment>
