<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's single-minded motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth beyond obsession; actions align with traits but lack nuanced reactions or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Circular structure undermines plot progression; repetitive descriptions create static momentum rather than coherent arc within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (e.g., "pale, dreamless sky," "liminal space") create haunting, immersive mood that complements tone and concept effectively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in setting/idea, but relies on mystical tropes; repetitive descriptors ("familiarly unknown") and underdeveloped symbolism suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements勉强 fit together without seamless cohesion; length suits vignette but lacks narrative urgency; tone/imagery linger, but thematic depth feels constrained.</comment>
