<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Weak character psychology; motivation lacks concrete behavioral evidence. Spinelessness contradicts moments of perceived "strange power." Underdeveloped voice in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Static plot structure; ritual repetition fails to create meaningful progression. Thinly spread cause-effect relationships between elements. Pacing uneven within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clinically precise sensory detailing of toxic environment. Atmospheric cohesion between mutated flora and emotional decay. Visual motifs strengthen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphor layering shows promise (botanical/human hybridity), but lacks emotional depth. Poetic fragments undercut by exposition-heavy passages. Final line's thematic echo feels hollow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Echoes of post-apocalyptic tropes without meaningful subversion. Over-reliance on compound descriptors feels algorithmic. "Great Unfurling" lacks mythic originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element integration superficial; worldbuilding outweighs narrative cohesion. Style oscillates between ornate and simplistic. Premature ending avoids resolution rather than transcending.</comment>
