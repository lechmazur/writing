<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Shallow characterization; traits like 'bluffing swindler' and 'energetically lethargic' are named but lack psychological depth. Motivation to reveal truth feels imposed rather than psychologically grounded, with abrupt shifts in behavior. Dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot uses high-concept elements to forward momentum but struggles with coherence within constraints. The 'frozen computer' restarting and book-drop meet-cute create structural scaffolding, but the resolution fizzles into vague thematic abstraction without earned climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, paradoxical setting (reclaimed orchard/skyscraper) masterfully evokes decay and rebirth through sensory details. Atmosphere supports thematic tension between past/future, but the magnetized forces and computer's "hum" feel undercontextualized in the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vague attempts at subtext (truth/unacknowledged costs) lack narrative traction. Dialogue is poetically wrought yet emotionally hollow. The 'gentle harshness' tone oscillates between lyrical and clinical, undercutting thematic unity. Ending feels like a half-posed question without resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original setting contrasts with overly familiar "crumbling civilization" tropes. Metaphors (magnetism, blank price tag) feel conceptually heavy-handed rather than organic. Emotional beats rely on exposition ('gnawing need') rather than subtext. Prose veers between sparse and baroque without rhythmic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements overload creates disjointedness; the frozen computer and 'invisible allies' feel tacked-on rather than thematically vital. Style oscillates between poetic and procedural. Conceptual ambition isn't matched by execution, leaving a hollow, half-formed impression despite memorable imagery.</comment>
