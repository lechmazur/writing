<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth; 'coyly furious' trait underexplored, inner conflict remains vague, reactions feel reactive rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Linear structure fulfills plot requirements but feels predetermined rather than emergent; cause-effect between prophecy decoding and grim revelation lacks narrative tension; ending feels inevitable but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative atmospheric details (holographic text, metallic feathers) enhance tone, but setting never transcends functional backdrop; abandoned bay's potential as character itself remains untapped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Effective use of paradoxical language ("cheerless ecstasy") and fate vs. agency themes, but emotional impact diluted by overreliance on abstract phrasing over concrete character embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Suffers from self-consciously ornate prose ("fragile defiance against the cosmic dread") and conceptual clich√©s; some fresh juxtapositions (shredded letters as prophecy fragments) undercut by predictable fatalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but without revelation; premise's philosophical potential (misunderstood vs. unavoidable fate) remains conceptually surface-level despite polished execution.</comment>
