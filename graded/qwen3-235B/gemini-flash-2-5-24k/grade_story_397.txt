<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Compact structure but relies on logical leaps between personal trauma and global pattern; pacing uneven in key transitions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy; style balances precision and overwrought phrasing without transcending its constraints.</comment>
