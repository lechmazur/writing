<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear cosmic motivation but lacks emotional depth or relatable human-like traits; actions align with assigned traits but character remains more symbolic than psychologically developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent progression from approach to ritual resolution, but the tight word limit flattens the middle section; cosmic scale feels underexplored despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethereal setting rich in sensory details (ozone, shimmering air) but disconnects from deeper character interaction; atmosphere enhances tone yet fails to deepen thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (leaves as blueprints) and cosmic-personal contrast (bard/orchard keeper) elevate impact; emotional resonance is muted but resonant themes of renewal through small actions linger.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s; combines celestial and mundane (e.g., apples/orbits) with fresh metaphors; occasional ornateness ("stellar breath") risks pretension but stays purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively (wind-guided journey, leaves as tools), but brief length occasionally sacrifices nuance; premise demands high-concept acceptance, limiting intimacy with themes.</comment>
