<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation of creating emotional legacy ties to actions, but the 'chameleon' aspect lacks depth in shaping concrete behaviors. Psychological nuance of rationally impulsive nature remains abstract rather than demonstrated through specific decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression of investigation-performance-reproduction cycle, but the tight word limit leaves character arc and resolution feeling truncated. Mysterious dress drives narrative but emotional beats lack development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Post-oil palace atmosphere has potent imagery, but environmental specifics remain under-deployed. "Anxious serenity" is stated but unevenly embodied - sensory details exist but could better intertwine with character psychology and plot mechanics.</question>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (sunlight through debris as truth) and theme of art creating legacy carry strong resonance. Emotional impact emerges through layered symbolism, though some concepts ("reproduction" of empathy) remain more told than viscerally shown in narrative micro-moments.</question>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in concept blending, but contains moments of abstract tell-rather-than-show writing. Some phrases ("desperate art," "fading echoes") verge on poetic vagueness rather than distinctive voice. The rationally impulsive trait lacks human idiosyncrasy in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds conceptually in merging elements into exploration of artistic purpose in decline, but narrative intimacy suffers from abstract treatment. Short form feels both purposeful in thematic compression and limited in emotional payoff potential.</comment>
