<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mute trait lacks depth beyond silence; motivation is clear but not fully integrated into actions; unassumingly bold is shown but underdeveloped; lacks distinct voice despite first-person proximity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect and clear progression, but minimal conflict and abrupt transcendence undercut narrative arc cohesion within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and atmospheric synergy with theme, but setting specifics (e.g., opera house decay) feel generic rather than purposefully symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphors, consistent theme of inner exploration, and immersive "showing" elevate impact; lacks emotional visceral punch despite intellectual resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tropes reinvigorated via focus on consciousness over physical travel; avoids AI-style repetition, but prose occasionally verges on ornate without purposeful excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematic whole; brevity feels intentional but slightly underserves character complexity; lingers conceptually rather than emotionally.</comment>
