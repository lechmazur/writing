<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character development feels schematic; internal conflict between arrogance and vulnerability is present but underexplored, with motivations occasionally feeling imposed rather than earned through concrete actions and decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within tight word limit but lacks complications or obstacles beyond internal struggle; resolution feels unearned and overly simplistic; beginning-to-end connection is thematically but not dramatically satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative phrases but relies too heavily on generic descriptors ("dust of neglect," "fragile ember") rather than specific, memorable sensory details; setting doesn't fully integrate with character or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some effective imagery ("melody...a fragile bridge between despair and possibility") but leaning on adjectival descriptions rather than showing through concrete actions; theme is clear but lacks depth or complexity; emotional beats are stated more than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Narrative follows a recognizable redemption trope without sufficient subversion; language alternates between poetic attempts and overused phrases; emotional arc feels predetermined rather than organically achieved; metaphoric elements border on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Required elements are all present but connections often feel contrived; some elements (wedding song, calligraphy) lack organic integration with character or setting; thematic ambitions are evident but execution remains surface-level.</comment>
