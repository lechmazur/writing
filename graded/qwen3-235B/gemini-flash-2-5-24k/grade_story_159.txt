<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's obsession with labyrinth stems logically from betrayal, but inner life remains abstract; transformation at wedding feels earned yet underdeveloped. Distinct voice eludes due to lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on fateful wedding encounter, but 500-word arc feels compressed; beginning/end connection exists yet resolution rushes epiphany. Motivation drives action but pacing strains credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luminous labyrinth offers striking visuals, but sensory details beyond light/shadow minimal; atmosphere supports theme but setting's ritualistic potential underutilized; floating lanterns more decorative than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (betrayal as maze entrance) resonate, but emotional register leans more told than shown; ending provides thematic closure yet lacks visceral impact; layered concept occasionally undermined by poetic vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal imagery (kaleidoscope readings) but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing; betrayal revelation feels human yet its significance borders on contrived; originality resides in symbolic layering rather than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements synergize conceptually (betrayal/kaleidoscope/maze), though confetti proposals strain verisimilitude; brevity serves thematic elegance at cost of narrative weight; leaves intellectual residue but emotional echo feels muted.</comment>
