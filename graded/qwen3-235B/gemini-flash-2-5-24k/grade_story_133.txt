<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character development shows promise through Elias' internal shift but lacks psychological depth; motivations hinge on an underexplored, abrupt revelation rather than organic growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot gains cohesion through symbolic objects but relies on a pivotal encounter feeling hastily inserted; cause/effect between pottery class and throne legacy requires stronger rationale.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imaginative setting details (rooftop orchard, colonial decay) and sensory immersion create visceral atmosphere, though some elements (faded patterns, damp clay) border on overused lyrical tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose delivers thematic resonance about legacy vs. power; subtext about preservation vs. conquest lingers, though emotional beats occasionally verge on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids most clich√©s but occasionally slips into ornamental phrasing ("watchful eyes of rooftop trees"); symbolic logic feels intentional rather than algorithmic, though thematic consistency wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion and layered themes elevate the piece despite compressed arcs; ends with resonant ambiguity about purpose and destiny that lingers effectively.</comment>
