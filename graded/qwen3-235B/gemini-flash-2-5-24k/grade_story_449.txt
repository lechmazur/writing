<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's awkwardness is mentioned but rarely manifests in concrete behaviors or decisions; motivations feel intellectualized rather than organically embodied through specific actions; philosophical pursuits drive the narrative more than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative lacks traditional plot progression; relies on static contemplation; baking and doodling serve as repetitive motifs rather than plot-driving actions; philosophical "completion" feels arbitrarily assigned rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid, poetic descriptions establish a haunting atmosphere; time dilation setting works effectively with cosmic/mundane contrasts; could deepen sensory integration to fully immerse readers in the paradoxical environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (storm as idea embodiment, baking as temporal grounding); invites contemplation of cosmic/intimate duality; lacks emotional urgency and dramatic tension; philosophical musings occasionally overshadow narrative embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blends high-concept sci-fi with domesticity in fresh ways; "individually general" concept risks over-explanation; some phrasing feels calculated rather than organically expressive; maintains stylistic consistency but occasionally veers into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but sometimes feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; philosophical themes resonate beyond the page but narrative impact remains diffuse; ambitious ideas outpace emotional actualization.</comment>
