<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness informs her isolation but lacks nuanced psychological depth; her fear-to-courage arc is clear but underexplored in terms of emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear progression under pressure of concise format; pacing feels slightly rushed in early sections but gains momentum through sensory focus on the anomaly's physical effects.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visceral gravity shifts create compelling atmosphere, but existential implications of the anomaly remain underdeveloped beyond immediate narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors of stone arrangement and responsive gravity hum carry thematic weight; ending achieves quiet catharsis but could deepen subtextual dialogue between physical/environmental vs. internal change.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar "riddle leads to awakening" structure; sensory details are specific but occasionally oversimplified, diluting potential surreal impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements integrated with above-average cohesion, but overall execution lacks the transformative punch required for top-tier publication; ideas never fully transcend their component parts.</comment>
