<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation exists but lacks depth; traits like 'awkward' are stated more than shown through nuanced actions or decisions. The postcard’s symbolism hints at internal conflict but remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emergence sequence shows clear structure but lacks stakes or consequence; hermit crab method feels conceptually inventive yet mechanically vague, weakening the plot’s logical cohesion. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally stagnant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting blends contrast (frigid vs. geothermal) effectively; sensory details enhance mood. Atmospheric elements conceptually support the theme, but the tundra’s symbolic connection to 'bridging worlds' is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor (hermit crabs as ritualistic motion) elevate the theme; ending resonates with quiet determination. Subtext about systems and communication is present but could be more layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original handling of 'hermit crabs' avoids cliché; some phrases (e.g., 'indifferent moon') border on generic. Emotional nuance is hinted at through action, not over-explained, but occasionally veers into abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements integrated with varying success; the blank postcard and emergence feel essential, while hermit crabs and 'final evidence' feel loosely tethered. Style is vivid but occasionally occludes clarity.</comment>
