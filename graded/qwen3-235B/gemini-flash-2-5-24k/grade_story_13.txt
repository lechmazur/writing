<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's stoicism and motivation are clear but lack depth; his actions align with his quest, but nuance in his personality or internal conflict is minimal, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear progression toward an endpoint, but the tight word limit sacrifices development; the beginning establishes stakes, while the ending feels abrupt, leaving the arc underresolved.</comment>
