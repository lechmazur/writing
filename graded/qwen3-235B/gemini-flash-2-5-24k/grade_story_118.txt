<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Presentation of hive-mind therapist lacks depth in distinct personality or internal conflict; motivation (anchoring regret) is clear but remains static without nuance; characters serve conceptual roles over psychological realism</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Static ritual lacks traditional arc; connection between eve of discovery and current actions remains underdeveloped; pacing suits atmosphere but fails to build narrative momentum within constrained format</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually compelling with ozone-regret contrast and wax artifacts; evocative atmosphere through sensory details (warm plug, dripping wax, ozone scent); setting's tension between espionage and therapy feels organic</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical treatment of regret through wax formations inventive yet under-explores emotional stakes; stylistic flourishes with multi-voice therapist work narratively but lack thematic profundity; conceptually memorable but emotionally distant</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in premise; metaphors remain fresh despite borderline ornate descriptions; narrative flow maintains internal logic without predictable patterns; emotional subtext occasionally explicit rather than subtextual</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Most elements service the story's concept but thematic cohesion suffers from underdeveloped emotional throughlines; stylistic choices mostly support clarity but occasionally prioritize aesthetics over narrative urgency; leaves interesting questions about regret without transformative resolution</comment>
