<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prince's motivation is clear but thinly sketched; emotional depth remains surface-level despite internal conflict. Recognizable emotional arc but lacks nuanced reactions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong arc within constraints; cause-effect of storm and ending resolution are logical. Pacing slightly rushed during teaching scene but maintains narrative flow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but with uneven depth. Leaves lingering thematic questions but lacks distinctive stylistic signature to elevate beyond competent craft.</comment>
