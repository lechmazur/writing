<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character is a nebulous abstraction with no internal conflict or psychological depth, functioning more as a vessel for the theme than a living entity. Motivation is declared but never dramatized through meaningful actions or choices that reveal humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>A static tableaux masquerading as plot - lacks rising action, tension, or resolution beyond repetitive cycles of work/contemplation. Causal logic for method (coded scuff marks) is never established within the world's rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich but surface-level imagery (glowing fish, skeletal ruins) creates atmosphere without conveying tactile reality. Environmental decay hints at thematic parallels but fails to fully immerse through specific, bodily sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of etching compassion into ice is conceptually potent, but emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition about intentions rather than showing their consequences. Metaphors often overwrite rather than crystallize meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stylized lyricism borders on self-parody with phrases like "pristine chaos," while the method feels plucked from algorithmic trope generators. Attempts at subverting sci-fi decay tropes are undercut by reliance on clich√©d "hope in darkness" declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>Elements like the satellite fragment and cursed lake create superficial cohesion but function as disconnected set pieces. The brevity feels like a constraint rather than an artistic choice, with the theme's importance asserted rather than earned through narrative weight.</comment>
