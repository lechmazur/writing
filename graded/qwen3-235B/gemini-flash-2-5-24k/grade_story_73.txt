<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot exists as a single vignette with no arc; action drives the moment but lacks traditional progression or resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors counterbalance overly ornate phrasing; avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into abstraction that weakens coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but uneven; story feels like a polished vignette rather than a cohesive, publishable piece with lasting resonance.</comment>
