<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lacks deep emotional nuance in character; motivations are clear but empathy feels narratively stated rather than viscerally shown through complex actions or layered decisions. The pendant's significance isn't fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Procedural clarity but pacing skews static; tension from time constraint underutilized. The arc's resolution lacks emotional payoff, feeling more like a technical solution than narrative climax. Cause-effect logic holds but feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visionary setting elements (alien embassy) underdeveloped; ambient contrasts (human relic vs. alien tech) are conceptually present but lack visceral details (e.g., texture of extraterrestrial architecture, alien sensory input). Atmosphere prioritizes thematic over immersive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphor in "conversation with energy" elevates theme. Subtext about compassionate power resonates, but emotional beats rely heavily on exposition ("deep-seated empathy"). Ending achieves thematic closure without melodrama, though somewhat predictably.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in subverting "magic" tropes toward ecological care. Some phrases verge on poetic abstraction ("calculated dreams") but avoid excess. Emotional logic is humanistic yet occasionally schematic; the washcloth's symbolism avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution. The alien setting feels optional; deeper integration of extraterrestrial specificity could enhance uniqueness. Strong central metaphor compensates for occasional schematic storytelling.</comment>
