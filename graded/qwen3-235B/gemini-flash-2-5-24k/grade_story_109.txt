<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's coldness and rebelliousness are surface traits; motivation shift feels abrupt, with insufficient internal conflict to anchor the transformation. Mitten's impact lacks emotional groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but cause/effect between mitten and awakening feels underdeveloped. Plot completeness exists per word constraints, yet the arc hinges on a moment better suited to slower-burn narratives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sterile agent center contrasts with mitten's warmth effectively; sensory details like mitten texture and cold air immersive. Altars and folkloric elements underexplored, reducing atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (coldness vs. connection) functional but not transcendent; emotional impact undercut by telling ("clarity," "preservation") rather than layered subtext. Theme of cultural memory hinted at but not deeply excavated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mitten as symbol is fresh; "sculptures of memory" and altars offer intrigue but lean on poetic abstraction vs. specific imagery. Integration of spy/folklore elements inventive yet mechanistic, lacking lived-in authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements cohere technically but feel checklist-adjacent; brevity hampers thematic payoff. Lingering feeling exists but leans on concept more than earned emotional resonance.</comment>
