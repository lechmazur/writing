<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Brashness and wild methods are stated but not deeply embodied in Flint's behavior or decisions; motivation is clear but underdeveloped in terms of emotional stakes or personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; the ritual's execution is abrupt, lacking escalation or tension; the word limit strains coherence between action and thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The discount store's atmosphere is evocative but underutilized; sensory details about dust and silence are strong, but the setting's potential as a metaphor for forgotten culture isn't fully mined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "war medal," "nautilus shell") is vivid and symbolic, but the ending's theme of reciprocity feels stated rather than earned; emotional resonance is thin despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unique combinations (discount store relic-hunting, detonation via nautilus) avoid clich√© but lean on mystical-artifact tropes; some phrases ("dusty exuberance") verge on contrived; pacing avoids formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack cumulative weight; the story is conceptually rich yet feels under-actualized due to space constraints; ideas outpace emotional engagement.</comment>
