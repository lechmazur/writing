<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's spineless nature is stated but rarely demonstrated through specific actions beyond internal monologue; motivations tied to payment feel underdeveloped compared to existential stakes of prophecy; minimal distinction in narrative voice despite first-person perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical sequence but relies heavily on exposition to convey progression; projection room exploration creates artificial constraint on journey; prophecy silencing lacks tangible consequences for tension within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Map projection's celestial visuals and humming atmosphere effectively evoke mystery; Victorian key's tactile details contrast nicely with digital projections; underutilizes timeframe element's atmospheric potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of understanding over force and the paradox of "grandly trivial" tools create intellectual resonance; frequent metaphysical abstractions occasionally undercut emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through symbolic fusion of antique/macabre (dollhouse key) with speculative (projection room); no detectable formulaic patterns; emotional subtext remains primarily cerebral rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Successfully integrates all assigned elements mechanically but struggles to create narrative synergy; stylistic ambition occasionally overshadows clarity; leaves interesting conceptual questions more than earned emotional payoff.</comment>
