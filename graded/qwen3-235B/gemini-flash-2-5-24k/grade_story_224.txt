<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape stagnation is clear but development relies heavily on abstract descriptions rather than concrete emotional grounding or nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc is conceptually complete but pacing veers toward static introspection; cause-effect between object interaction and transformation feels underdeveloped despite the tight frame.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ambient atmosphere is vivid (dust motes, silence), but the giant's dining room's symbolic function remains underexplored; rushed-hour contrast feels superficial rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (silence as affirmation) are evocative but lack subtext; emotional resonance hinges on abstraction rather than earned specificity, weakening thematic impact despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conceptually original elements (meteorite ladle, giant's dining room) occasionally read as surreal for surrealism's sake; some phrases ("gentle turmoil") border on clich√©d, undercutting emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack visceral depth; brevity serves the introspective tone but risks feeling like a vignette rather than a fully realized narrative with lasting resonance.</comment>
