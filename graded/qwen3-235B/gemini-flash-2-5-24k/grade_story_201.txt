<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's impulsiveness and whimsy are occasionally demonstrated but often stated; her motivation is clear but underdeveloped, with insufficient nuance in connecting her personality to specific decisions beyond the final symbolic act.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a quest arc with logical progression, but cause-effect ties between the music sheet’s clues and spatial/narrative obstacles are underexplored; pacing uneven as climax feels rushed despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting and dusk atmosphere are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sound of waterfall, dust, visuals of ruins) effectively enhancing mood; however, the fortress’s symbolic connection to the music sheet’s legacy lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (locket as betrayal, resonant chord) create emotional resonance; ending resolves conflict but leans on familiar metaphors rather than subverting tropes. Theme of inherited trauma is hinted at but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on vaguely mystical tropes (cosmic guidance, symbolic artifacts); moments of overwrought description (“restless harmony”) detract from clarity. Subtext remains surface-level, with emotional beats often told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Elements are woven into a coherent whole, though some (shooting stars, fortress) feel more integral than others (whimsy as a trait). The ending suggests thematic closure but lacks lingering complexity to elevate the narrative beyond competent execution.</grade>
