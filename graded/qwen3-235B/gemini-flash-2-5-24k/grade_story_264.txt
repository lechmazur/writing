<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits (chaotic yet precise, cheerful yet cautious) that shape actions with the cracked lens and projector, but lacks deeper psychological complexity despite dialogue and gestures that suggest hidden layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minimal but coherent arc: setup, demonstration, revelation of 'touched sky' with emotional resonance. Pacing deliberate but risks feeling static; tension lies in fragile balance between wonder/science rather than plot movement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stale coffee, ozone, and humming projector create an immersive, atmospheric liminal space. Sensory details like flickering light through the cracked lens perfectly mirror the "touched sky's" fragile mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evokes subtle awe through metaphors of fragility (cracked lens, violet haze as "signature"). Subtext of transient beauty clashing with human impermanence. Ending avoids resolution to linger on quiet transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases lean on poetic abstraction ("hauntingly cheerful," "infinite caution") that feel slightly constructed, but the fusion of alchemy/science through the projector demonstration feels inventive and specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements merge organically into a cohesive study of wonder as methodology. Short length emphasizes stillness without feeling artificial, leaving resonance in its unresolved tension between fragility and certainty.</comment>
