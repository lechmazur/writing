<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation (overcoming vow) is clear but insufficiently tied to joviality; actions align with goal but character lacks depth in emotional progression or history</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Purpose-driven action flows logically; opening/end mirror each other but resolution remains deferred; compressed narrative succeeds structurally but lacks complete arc within limits</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but require reader extrapolation beyond text; brief length enhances mystical atmosphere but limits narrative payoff</comment>
