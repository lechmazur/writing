<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ruthless flower arranger trait lacks integration with core motivations; "polite anarchy" contrasts without full character embodiment. Motivation to decode rock art remains underexplored beyond surface plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stone circle climax effectively resolves initial quest, but road trip conversations as decoding method feel underdeveloped within tight structure. Pacing stumbles slightly between atmospheric detail and plot momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory interplay between bruised twilight skies and charged ancient silence creates immersive atmosphere. Comb/rock art connections enhance motif of transient vs. eternal, though some details feel overly curated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Melancholic warning revealed through silence-framed music offers thematic resonance. Ending achieves emotional weight through contrast between fleeting beauty and eternal knowledge, though subtext remains partially implicit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality in flower-arranging archaeologist hybrid concept stands out, but certain phrases ("watcher's burden," "polite anarchy") verge on pseudo-profound abstraction. Some atmospheric descriptions border on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Economical execution of complex character-plot-world interplay within constraint. Story's strength lies in marrying mundane (comb, radio song) with mystical, though thematic cohesion slightly compromised by compressed form.</comment>
