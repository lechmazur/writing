<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's reckless yet meticulous nature is well-integrated, with motivation (mapping ghost towns) deeply connected to his past trauma. The camera lens object reveals psychological complexity, though emotional depth could be more nuanced beyond the established metaphor of avoidance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc despite tight word limit, with the forgotten promise effectively driving the protagonist's transformation. The action of "mapping" ghost towns consistently propels the narrative forward. Some transitions between introspection and external observation could be smoother.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Abandoned funfair setting in mist creates a haunting, cohesive atmosphere that perfectly complements the character's psychological state. Sensory details (silent rides, shroud-like mist, weight of camera lens) are evocative and consistently theme-supporting. Exceptionally effective world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Story delivers emotional impact through masterful use of metaphor (lens as emotional filter) and symbolic imagery. Ending is both satisfying and thematically resonant. While character motivations remain clear, emotional resonance might have been deeper with more showing and less telling of internal states.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing through original metaphors (mapping as emotional avoidance) and psychological depth. Some phrasing (particularly descriptions of mist) border on poetic redundancy. The twist of turning the lens inward shows creativity, though the musician element feels slightly schematic in its narrative function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively toward thematic purpose. Brief format is skillfully utilized, with the tight word count enhancing the story's impact. The juxtaposition of physical mapping and emotional avoidance demonstrates creative thinking. Leaves lingering questions about confronting one's past.</comment>
