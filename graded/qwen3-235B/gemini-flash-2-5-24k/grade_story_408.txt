<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent but underdeveloped; motivations are hinted at but lack depth. The conscientious objector background informs actions, but the "coy malevolence" remains underexplored and risks simplification.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story maintains coherence within the word limit, but lacks a traditional arc. Beginning/end circularity (Elias watching) works, yet progression feels static due to constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective atmosphere through storm-ravaged orchard imagery. Sensory details are evocative but uneven; the setting enhances mood but some elements (craft fairs) are underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext (control vs. freedom). The theme of surveillance-as-control resonates, but emotional depth is occasionally sacrificed for abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh angles on conscientious objection. Avoids tropes but slips into ornate phrasing; "valiantly bored" and "coy malevolence" strain plausibility, though not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements fit logically, but cohesion is strained by brevity. The ending feels inevitable yet underdeveloped. Leaves lingering questions but lacks resolution to fully solidify its thematic weight.</comment>
