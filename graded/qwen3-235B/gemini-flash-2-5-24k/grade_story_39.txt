<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s restlessness and deceptive facade shape her actions effectively, though her internal conflicts remain underexplored. Her motivation to “sculpt a new tomorrow” is clear but lacks visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lantern’s discovery drives the plot cohesively, but the shift from bookshop mysteries to survival caches feels abrupt despite the tight word limit. Pacing balances momentum with underdeveloped transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid Martian biodome atmosphere (corrosion, recycled air) and sensory details (lantern’s warmth) create immersion. The setting deeply informs the story’s tone and Elara’s desperation for hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (lantern as hope, “cautious abandon” phrasing) elevates thematic resonance. The ending’s resolve feels earned, though subtext about rebuilding versus survival could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes but relies on occasionally ornate phrasing (“sculpt a new tomorrow”) and functional metaphors. Grit and endurance themes verge on cliché without nuanced emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically into a cohesive, thought-provoking whole. The Martian setting and lantern’s role anchor the story, though some descriptors (e.g., “ephemeral cameo appearances”) feel contrived.</comment>
