<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; longing and tremors convey internal conflict, but backstory remains absent. Actions align with motivations, but voice lacks depth and distinctiveness typical of literary excellence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot stalls in a perpetual "approach to the altar" without resolution or clear arc. The assigned action's purpose remains abstract, and the word limit exacerbates structural incompleteness. Logical cause-effect but lacks momentum or payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., spray paint, incense) immerse readers in the setting. Atmosphere supports the tone and theme, though integration of time ("echoing hour") feels superficially symbolic rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (amber, cathedral decay) deepen subtext, but emotional resonance is diluted by overly explicit telling of emotions. Ending lacks satisfying resolution, though central conflict is clear and the tone lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar tropes (haunted mercenary, symbolic artifact). Some phrases ("carefully reckless grace") border on contrived. Writing style avoids purple prose but lacks distinctive innovation to elevate it above formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but cursorily exploited. Brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate; the story lacks transformative depth or lingering resonance despite competent execution. Style supports clarity but not transcendent impact.</comment>
