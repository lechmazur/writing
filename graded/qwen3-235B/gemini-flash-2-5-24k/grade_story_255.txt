<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits shape actions through scent-based method, but motivation lacks depth; "innocent cynicism" isn't fully embodied, and third-person narration avoids distinct voice but maintains conceptual consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Decoding drives plot effectively, with cause-effect clear despite abstract method; ending progresses but lacks full resolution, weakened by rushed transitions between atmospheric setup and final revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (dust, cake, imaginary petrichor) create immersive atmosphere; setting enhances mood, but connection between relic's historical weight and control tower's post-party decay remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (code as roots, scent as key) and theme of justice through unconventional means elevate the narrative; ending feels like a prologue rather than complete arc, reducing emotional gravitas.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original integration of scent as decryption method avoids clich√©s; "analytically innovative" and "innocent cynicism" feel conceptually forced in places; prose balances poetic imagery with moments of vague abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements cohere around metaphorical logic, but thematic cohesion suffers from underdeveloped arcs; brevity feels deliberate but leaves certain components (e.g., cosmic balance) underrealized.</comment>
