<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to learn sacrifice is clear but underdeveloped; the "mild zealot" trait lacks nuanced demonstration beyond surface descriptions; reactions to money feel abstract rather than personally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on visualization action but lacks narrative arc; cause-effect is murky between rituals and revelations; ending resolves nothing despite word constraints; pacing floats between contemplation and epiphany without earned progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Strange attractor laboratory" and its resonant energy creates eerie, timeless atmosphere; sensory details anchor reader but sometimes verge into vague poeticism; rustic refinement feels specifically connected to character's methodical approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (money as scars, wishes as vortex) evoke thematic resonance; ending whispers of legacy offer lingering reflections; subtext about invisible histories works, though emotional impact remains intellectually distant rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Contains moments of poetic originality but relies on "haunted objects" trope without subversion; sensory details sometimes generic (rustic refinement) rather than specific; theme execution feels like thoughtful meditation rather than revelatory storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack organic integration; atmospheric potential undercut by abstract plotting; leaves conceptual question about sacrifice but lacks emotional urgency or distinctive voice to elevate beyond philosophical exercise.</comment>
