<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like curiosity and determination are clear but motivation to make amends lacks emotional granularity; reactions to the mask feel logically consistent but underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses via interconnected wishes, but the pivotal moment of connection feels abrupt; pacing is deliberate yet strained by the tight word limit, leaving resolution underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting relies heavily on conceptual abstractions (nano-scale city, "veins" of light) but lacks vivid sensory details; the timeframe's metaphorical role is underutilized beyond mood-setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "resonant frequencies of connection") elevate the theme of fractured relationships; ending balances hope with ambiguity, though emotional impact is diluted by abstract prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Creative premises (miniature plague mask, wish-based communication) avoid clichés, but phrases like "network of fragile hope" lean into poetic abstraction rather than grounded originality; emotional beats are stated more than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic fusion of technology and reconciliation showcases ingenuity, but uneven execution—aesthetics overshadow character depth—leaves the brief length feeling both purposeful and restrictive.</comment>
