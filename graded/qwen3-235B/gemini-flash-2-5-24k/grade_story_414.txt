<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; Kael's loyalty and Elara's "pleasantly troublesome" contrast lack psychological nuance despite their narrative roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a functional arc but suffers from compressed pacing; the barricade conflict is visceral but the dance class encounter-to-cavern transition feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized with bioluminescent atmosphere, but the temporal element ("while illusions fade") is superficially integrated, diluting thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storytelling employs effective symbolism (scrimshaw as temporal bridge) and lyrical imagery, though emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept (tracking consciousness residue) but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction; dance class setup leans on contrivance, diluting authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Omits overt cliche but occasionally substitutes flowery exposition for lived-in detail; tone shifts unevenly between mystical and grounded during the barricade sequence.</comment>
