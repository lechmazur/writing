<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to break generational curse is clear and consistent, but emotional depth lacks nuance; the "steadily unpredictable" attribute is applied superficially through his melodies without fully integrating into his psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but strained by abrupt transitions (e.g., moonrise progression) and underdeveloped cause-effect relationships; the cyclical connection between beginning/end feels forced due to tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with evocative sensory details (rust, amber light), though emotional resonance diluted by overreliance on visual elements; the launch site's symbolic decay powerfully mirrors the family's trajectory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storytelling employs effective literary devices (embroidered stanzas as metaphor) and explores subtext about inherited trauma, but sentimental phrasing undermines thematic subtlety; ending succeeds in transforming elegy into possibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s but contains faintly mechanical phrasing ("magnificent desolation") and occasionally generic descriptors; the fusion of rocket site/tablecloth ritual shows ingenuity, though psychological realism remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story demonstrates cohesive integration of elements but occasionally feels shaped by assignment constraints rather than organic necessity; the emotional payoff is undercut by occasionally strained symbolic logic.</comment>
