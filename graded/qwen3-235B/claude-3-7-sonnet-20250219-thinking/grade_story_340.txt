<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (Marcos’ rivalry with Sofia’s legacy) drive the plot, but his recklessness vs. precision feels inconsistently weighted. Dialogue reveals personality but lacks deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Closure of Spirit Pathways inciting the spell creates strong causal momentum. Pacing tightens the three-act structure, though the resolution’s implications feel underexplored due to word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Altavida’s treehouse-amazon blend has vivid imagery but underutilized sensory detail (e.g., humidity, organic decay). The crystalline clock’s skipped beat introduces tension without anchoring the ethereal-mundane contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., “withered spiritual highways”) merge worldbuilding and theme. Dialogue sharpens Marcos’ cynicism vs. Lucia’s pragmatism. Ends on a thematic resonance of legacy vs. reinvention.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subverts trope of exorcist-as-hero by making Marcos a rule-breaker, but Sofia’s “madness” cliché lingers. Avoids purple prose but relies on familiar magical archetypes (grimoires, amulets).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (grimoire, closure, pathways) interlock cohesively. The tight length sacrifices deeper exploration of consequences but maintains narrative momentum and thematic clarity.</comment>
