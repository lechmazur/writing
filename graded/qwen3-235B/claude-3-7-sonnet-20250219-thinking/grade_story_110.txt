<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characterization is vivid but psychological depth feels underexplored; motivations are implied rather than fully realized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot is atmospheric but lacks forward momentum or clear resolution within constraints; cyclical structure risks redundancy over narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eerie, tactile descriptions (lantern moss, clock mechanics) create immersive gothic atmosphere that thematically resonates with character and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic parallels between timekeeping/assassination create haunting emotional resonance; self-aware narration adds thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with inventive syntheses (assassin-artist) but occasionally stumbles with marginally overwritten metaphors; generally fresh voice.</comment>
