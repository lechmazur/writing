<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eliza's dual identity as physicist and tavern waitress provides conflict and insight, with motivation clearly tied to her background and environment. However, her intellectual processes occasionally overshadow emotional complexity, making her seem more archetypal than fully dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure connects autumn leaf to transformation proposal, maintaining narrative economy. Pacing falters slightly in handling firefly phenomena, feeling more symbolic than organic within the plot's physics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends dying industry textures with ethereal firefly magic effectively, though some imagery (postcards as "fragments") risks over-articulation. Timeframe of change deadline adds tension but underutilizes autumn's thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor layers coal/fireflies/light creation against tradition vs innovation resonate deeply. Circular structure elevates the ending, though thematic emphasis occasionally turns didactic during exposition scenes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Contains formulaic elements (underdog protagonist, mystical symbols) but subverts expectations through technical specificity (energy solutions, atmospheric science). Some sensory details border on sentimental rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Elements serve narrative purpose without feeling contrived. Brief length sharpens focus on transformation's pivotal moment. Lingering questions about community reception suggest narrative depth beyond explicit text.</comment>
