<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation and consistent actions, distinct voice in third person, but emotional depth slightly constrained by brevity; growth feels earned yet compressed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong causal chain and labyrinth-driven plot coherence; pacing occasionally strained by word limit but resolves tightly, balancing compression with payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in workshop’s colossal scale and forbidden spark-lit corners; atmosphere amplifies theme but occasionally leans on familiar "enchanted workshop" tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism (labyrinth, discarded sparks) and resonant theme of creation vs. convention; ending transcends tropes with philosophical weight, though subtext could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("precisely playful," "fractured beauty") avoid cliché; prose balances lyricism with clarity, though a few descriptors verge on ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a cohesive meditation on innovation; slight seams show in labyrinth-path integration, but brevity feels purposeful, leaving haunting questions about creativity and erasure.</comment>
