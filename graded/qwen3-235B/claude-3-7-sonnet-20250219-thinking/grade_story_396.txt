<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcel’s forgetful charm and reverence for discarded items shape his actions well, though his dynamic with Élise leans on familiar tropes. Motivation to preserve beauty is clear, but character nuances are occasionally surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to negotiation, with the fragment driving progression. Pacing is brisk but cohesive within constraints. The ending resolves the central conflict but feels slightly rushed, lacking deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Parisian settings (salvage warehouse, champagne vault) evoke rich, contrasting atmospheres—decaying industry vs. historical opulence. Sensory details (e.g., “limestone walls,” “centuries-old champagne”) immerse readers, though the vault’s potential isn’t fully exploited thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storytelling excels in evocative imagery (e.g., “fragment cradled like a wounded bird”) and layered tension between preservation and memory. Dialogue reveals subtext without overexplaining. Ending resonates metaphorically, though themes occasionally veer toward predictable dichotomies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fresh integration of historical detail and urban scavenging avoids cliché, but phrases like “disinterested passion” and the “institutional vs. outsider” trope could feel more inventive. Sensory details lean vivid but occasionally default to familiar elegance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly around the fragment’s symbolic role, with setting and character motivations interwoven purposefully. The tight word limit sharpens focus but leaves some emotional beats underdeveloped. The ending lingers, though its thematic weight could feel more original.</comment>
