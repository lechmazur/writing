<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Weak interiority; motivations rely more on plot contrivance than psychological depth. Actions align with "foolhardy" trait but lack nuance. Voice remains consistent but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rapid progression feels compressed rather than paced. Some cause-effect gaps (tape discovery to mass communication). Resolution satisfies structural arc but lacks tension escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details excel in snow/wind imagery but underutilize other seasons. Micro-macro contrast works atmospherically but lacks emotional interplay between setting and characters.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors transcend gimmickry; the "language of wind/waves" as external control critiques determinism subtly. Ending avoids sentimentality while delivering thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids obvious fantasy tropes with snow globe's sentient communication system. No purple prose; linguistic precision maintains thematic rigor without sacrificing wonder.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesively rather than checklist fulfillment. Short length enhances existential brevity. Subtly embeds philosophical questions about agency beneath fantastical premise.</comment>
