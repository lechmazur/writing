<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (archiving stories), but lacks emotional depth or conflict; actions are functionally consistent but not personally revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Simple cause-effect structure works; pacing leans into poetic pauses but the arc feels compressed rather than fully resolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid fusion of ancient/futuristic details immerses through synesthetic descriptions (humming architecture, shouting silence).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emotion emerges through metaphor (bread-warming as dormant state); recursive math/poetry theme resonates; lacks visceral human stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes but occasionally lapses into overwrought phrasing ("quantum particles of the image"); cultural synthesis feels intentional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion, but brevity limits character texture; the central paradox (machine preserving organic stories) lingers.</comment>
