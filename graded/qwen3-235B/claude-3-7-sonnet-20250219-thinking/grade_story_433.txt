<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth in showing how influence eroded relationships. Voice remains overly expository rather than authentically introspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structural arc is complete but condensed. Plot transitions between discovery and transformation feel rushed, weakening emotional gravity despite logical cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery and snow-bound setting masterfully employ tactile details (frost textures, muffled acoustics) to mirror protagonist's internal thawing. Atmosphere strongly enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prophecy fragments function as effective metaphor for self-discovery. Subtext about modern influence's costs lands precisely. Ending satisfies as earned transformation rather than pat resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through atmospheric specificity, but relies on familiar redemption arc structure. Some phrases ('framing for an audience') tilt toward modern jargon rather than organic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively, with tight thematic interweaving between transient art and protagonist's impermanence of influence. Brief length enhances metaphorical resonance rather than constraining narrative.</comment>
