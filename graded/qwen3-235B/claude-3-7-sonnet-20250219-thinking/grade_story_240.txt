<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong alignment between pragmatism and actions, but "lavishly humble" remains underdeveloped. Motivation is clear but could explore deeper contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid three-act structure within constraints, but the drought resolution feels slightly rushed. Cause-effect between hammer strikes and rain lacks nuanced explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements support thematic cohesion, though memory's corridors and timeframe feel imposed rather than organic. Compact structure suggests intentional brevity with minor pacing hiccups.</comment>
