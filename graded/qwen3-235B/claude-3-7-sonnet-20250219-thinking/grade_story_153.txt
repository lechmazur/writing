<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sebastian’s immortality is integral to his detachment and purpose, but emotional nuance is occasionally sacrificed for mythic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from archival labor to revelatory purpose, though the ending’s sudden shift to “tenderness” feels less earned than narratively asserted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viscerally bleak yet poetic underground worldbuilding, though the post-stellar timeframe’s existential weight leans heavily on loaded phrases over immersive sensory work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fully integrates subtext about knowledge as both burden and salvation, with metaphor-rich prose that could risk overextension but generally enhances thematic heft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through hyper-specificity (e.g., moler society), but occasional over-reliance on “weight of ages” phrasing edges toward conceptual bloat.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exquisite tension between cosmic scope and human-scale longing; the brevity paradoxically deepens its resonance as a meditative fragment rather than narrative arc.</comment>
