<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eleanor is distinctively characterized (ruthlessness as flower arranger and archaeologist), but Javier feels like a placeholder. The scuffed comb's symbolic function is underexplored despite its narrative importance. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is cleverly structured around the solstice concert's timing, but the 20-second heist feels rushed. Resolution ties back to Eleanor's dual life, though the flower shop return lacks emotional resonance. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stone circle atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, but the "polite anarchy" tone remains superficial. Nightshade's concert worldbuilding lacks deeper cultural context. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story's uniqueness in merging flower arranging with archaeology is memorable. The "watcher's burden" theme is introduced but underdeveloped. Dialogue feels purposeful yet slightly didactic. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clever premise avoids formulaicity, but phrases like "haunting note" and "surface narrative" border on clich√©. Emotional subtext shown through actions (comb on dashboard, encrypted research) works well. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements create a cohesive, surprising narrative within constraints. The concise format serves as a vignette capturing Eleanor's dual identity, though some connections feel underexplored. </comment>
