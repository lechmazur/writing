<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (truth retrieval) is clear but lacks depth in how her past experiences shape her present actions; emotional nuance in apprehension is hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is logical but strained by tight word limits—transitions between memories and action feel abrupt; candle mechanism lacks sufficient setup to feel fully earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies heavily on cyberpunk tropes (neon, hum of tech) with minimal fresh sensory details; "borrowed dawn" metaphor is evocative but inconsistently woven into the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., candle disrupting reality filters) is striking, but themes are stated overtly rather than shown; ending resolves the action but undersells emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Originality in merging archery with data heists is strong, but reliance on exposition-heavy flashbacks and the "Great Revision" backstory feels formulaic; tone occasionally veers toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cohesive but derivative; some elements (e.g., historian, grandmother’s compassion) feel tacked on rather than organically tied to the central mission; leaves room for thematic reflection but lacks piercing originality.</comment>
