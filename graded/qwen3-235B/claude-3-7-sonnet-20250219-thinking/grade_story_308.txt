<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Malik's dual identity shows promise but lacks deeper nuance; motivations are clear yet his internal conflicts remain underexplored, relying on surface-level contrasts between bashfulness and fervor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure is mostly cohesive, though the transition from yoga class to familial ritual feels slightly rushed. The circular motif of preservation ties the ending to the beginning effectively within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like lantern reflections and ceremonial paint create atmosphere, but the floating studio’s unique qualities are underutilized beyond being a passive setting for tides and dance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Keychains as heirlooms and the dance’s corporeal memory evoke emotional resonance. The metaphor of tides as legacy carriers is poetic, though some subtextual layers feel implied rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending yoga with ancestral ritual, but occasional phrases (“severing ignorance”) lean into abstraction over visceral impact. The tone avoids melodrama but could lean further into complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a compelling narrative with thematic focus, though the story’s emotional depth occasionally leans on symbolic shorthand rather than deeper exploration of character interiority.</comment>
