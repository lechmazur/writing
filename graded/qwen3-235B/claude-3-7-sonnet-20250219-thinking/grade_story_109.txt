<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's icy exterior and emotional awakening show gradual integration, but motivations occasionally lean on narrative convenience rather than psychological complexity. The connection between assigned traits and actions remains plausible yet slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight cause-effect chain drives the narrative, with the mitten as effective plot catalyst. The beginning-to-end character transformation feels compressed but coherent within the word limit. Pacing lags slightly during exposition but accelerates meaningfully toward resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting balances industrial decay with spiritual warmth through specific details (moonlit mitten, handwritten cards). Atmospheric contrasts work well, though deeper texture could further enhance the secretive, healing duality central to the story's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (incomplete altars, duality of duties) creates emotional resonance. Subtext about institutional vs personal healing adds depth. The ending avoids sentimentality while delivering thematic payoff, with "show-don't-tell" consistently maintained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique concept juxtapositions, though the knight-in-modern-universe framing occasionally feels contrived. Sensory details avoid generic descriptors. Emotional progression feels earned rather than algorithmically assigned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively despite slight friction in the knight/agent hybrid identity. The brevity amplifies emotional beats rather than diluting them. Thematic persistence beyond the final page effectively lingers.</comment>
