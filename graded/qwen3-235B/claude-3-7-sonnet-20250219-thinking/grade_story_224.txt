<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape mundanity is clear and consistent, but deeper exploration of "openly private" trait's paradox would strengthen psychological depth; transformation feels abrupt despite setup</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Concept-driven plot flows logically with satisfying beginning-to-end growth, but pacing falters in meteorite interaction; cause-effect between object's properties and transformation needs stronger internal logic</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Giants' dining room offers rich sensory atmosphere with steam and tremors; cosmic/ancient elements in meteorite contrast well with domestic setting, though deeper time pressure during "rush hour" missed</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eloquent metaphors ("background music to lives larger") elevate theme of self-realization; ending resonates with symbolic weight despite brevity, though emotional subtext could be more nuanced</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original combining of mythology elements avoids most tropes, but "gentle turmoil" phrasing borders on stock emotional description; some sensory details (meteorite texture) feel purposefully chosen rather than organically rendered</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements create cohesive fable-like structure; brevity serves transformation theme but loses opportunities for deeper exploration of "silence affirmation" and meteorite's history</comment>
