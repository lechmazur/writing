<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are mostly consistent but motivation and past failures lack deep exploration. Interactions are brief yet show potential for nuance, particularly with Delia and grandfather's legacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but the global impact of decryption feels abrupt. Pacing is tight, though the connection between Marcus's actions and consequences could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Creative blend of retro diner ambiance and digital secrecy creates strong atmosphere. Sensory details like buzzing lights and the coffee pot enhance immersion, though deeper exploration of the "hidden archive" could heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (whistle as heirloom/weapon) and thematic depth ("walking backward") enrich the narrative. Ending resonates but some phrases ("tree of regret") verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Unique elements (whistle-based decryption) stand out, but reliance on inventor tropes and occasionally expository language ("restless acceptance") undercut originality. Emotional resonance is mixed—Delia's reveal feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but integration varies; the encrypted archive's diner setting strains believability. Delia's hinted connection to the grandfather feels underdeveloped for such a concise format. Thematic ambition is clear but execution uneven.</comment>
