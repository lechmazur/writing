<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct but underdeveloped; Malik's eccentricity and Chen's transformation feel surface-level despite clear motivations. Limited exploration of inner conflicts hinders full realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with tight cause-effect, but the abrupt meteors-to-decay shift feels underexplained. The ending satisfies emotionally yet lacks structural ambition within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Blends mundane (TV, tracking station) with mystical (projected light) effectively. Sensory details create immersive contrasts, though baseball game's tonal contrast borders on jarring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Metaphors (hum as cosmic language) and imagery (light silk) elevate thematic resonance about wonder vs. cynicism. Somewhat predictable redemption arc dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Innovative projector/meteors interplay avoids clich√©, but overused "humming machines" trope and vague "infinite caution" phrasing lean toward familiar mystical tropes. Emotional nuance remains human despite occasional florid prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist cohesively but prioritize spectacle over deeper thematic integration. Tone consistency suffers occasionally (e.g., TV juxtaposition), yet the ending lingers with poignant impermanence.</comment>
