<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lack of direct characterization beyond functional traits; motivation is conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped; the watchman's actions align with stated goals but remain archetypal rather than deeply human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Procedural progression through object examination works despite constraints, but the abruptness of the cosmic revelation lacks sufficient dramatic buildup; thematic bookends work better than structural payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Highly cohesive thematic scaffolding despite element density; style serves conceptual scope without pretension; brevity amplifies mystical ambiguity while sacrificing some emotional grounding.</comment>
