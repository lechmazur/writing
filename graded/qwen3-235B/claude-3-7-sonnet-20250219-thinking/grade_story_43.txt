<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's wariness and introversion are established through self-addressed dialogue, but motivation to "spark reunion with courage" remains underdeveloped; emotional breakthrough feels sudden rather than earned through gradual revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to catharsis, but the 500-word constraint forces rushed resolution; time jump from CD insertion to AI awakening lacks transitional grounding despite clear beginning/end symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Neon cathedral's fusion of decaying technology and organic decay creates an unforgettable atmosphere; sensory details like "rain-slick floors" and "spectral light" immerse readers, though integration with character psychology remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of data motes as living legacy creates thematic resonance; ending's "crooked hope" balances melancholy and optimism, but emotional impact diluted by heavy-handed exposition about courage rather than authentic character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in data motes/fireflies and cathedral-as-museum, but relies on post-human trope without subversion; language occasionally succumbs to ornate descriptors ("electric blues and violets against the void") that prioritize style over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically around courage/mortality, with economy of form that respects brevity; struggles to transcend genre conventions, but leaves lingering questions about legacy and emotional inheritance in non-human consciousness.</comment>
