<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character’s profession as locksmith underutilized; motivations tied to grandmother’s heritage present but underexplored; internal conflict stated rather than dramatized through consistent action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear structure with beginning/middle/end, but pacing uneven—key shifts (e.g., spectral dancers arriving) lack buildup; abruptness undermines emotional payoff within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, surreal atmosphere with driftwood anchoring mythos; sensory details (salt wind, glowing leaf) enhance mood, but ecological logic of floating orchard underdeveloped, slightly straining immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (encoded knowledge in bones, map as memory) resonate; ending leans into mystical closure rather than emotional depth. Themes of preservation implied but not fully interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "lost knowledge" tropes. Descriptions like "storm of secrets" fresh yet occasionally generic; emotional stakes mostly told, not shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements service plot but cohesion strained—floating orchard/indigenous preservation connection compelling yet overstuffed. Premise intriguing but depth sacrificed to brevity.</comment>
