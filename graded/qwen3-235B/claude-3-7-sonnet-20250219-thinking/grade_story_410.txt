<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character displays consistent traits (astute via precise actions, isolated through backstory), but emotional depth remains surface-level; motivations hinted at through rituals but lack psychological layering.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying circularity through bread's aroma triggering the robot's arrival, but elevator's sudden activation lacks prior setup; pacing compressed yet coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent flora and ritual baking avoid clich√©s, but isolation trope leans familiar; language occasionally becomes overwritten ("subterranean cathedral") without adding weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion, particularly scent as plot device; compression works conceptually but sacrifices some character introspection for brevity.</comment>
