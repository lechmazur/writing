<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character development relies heavily on exposition; Marcus’s internal conflict surfaces abruptly without sufficient buildup, weakening the impact of his eventual resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but strained by the word limit; the twist feels slightly contrived, undermining the abrupt resolution of the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (moths, darkness), but the setting’s symbolic potential (observation tower as ideological battleground) is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (moths as dogma, comedy as weapon) and layered tension; ending delivers thematic resonance despite rushed emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending surveillance, comedy, and cosmic dread; some phrasing (e.g., “inside storms”) risks cliché but avoids full predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres but leans on gimmicks; the twist recontextualizes earlier details effectively, though brevity sacrifices depth in character and theme.</comment>
