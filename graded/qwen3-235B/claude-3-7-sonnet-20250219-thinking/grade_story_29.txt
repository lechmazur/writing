<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak emotional interiority despite clear motivation; character actions align with assigned traits but lack nuanced reactions to assigned object or thematic weight; flat 'voice' despite third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight structure uses 400-word constraints effectively; action drives plot logically but resolution via abstract frequencies strains suspension of disbelief; consistent beginning-to-end through-line.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory contrasts between modern streetlamp and mystic orchard create unsettling harmony; atmosphere flawlessly reinforces tone of tragic hope but occasionally veers into ornate overdescription.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evokes poignant emotional beats through physicalized metaphor (mathematics of emotion) but lacks subtextual complexity; ending achieves catharsis yet relies on surface-level emotional descriptors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subverts 'brute force' knight trope through intellectual approach; avoids purple prose but employs some familiar fantasy motifs (whispering trees, luminous fruits) without sufficient reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved but elements occasionally feel checklist-driven (e.g., singing flowers serve no narrative purpose); thematic resonance emerges through emotional climax but could linger more post-resolution.</comment>
