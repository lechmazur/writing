<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth beyond archetypal traits; financial motivation and bravery established but underdeveloped. "Carefully careless" gesture is well-placed but not meaningfully connected to core actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but lack narrative complexity; haunted dinner progression feels abrupt. Cause/effect between blood drive meeting and final confrontation exists but feels under-earned within tight frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Masterful atmospheric details create immersive dread through sensory specifics (marble echoes, glass terrariums, crimson damask). Botanical collection's symbolic potential underutilized despite strong decorative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective chilling progression through eerie set pieces and clever ghostly dinner twist. Writing style uneven - strong metaphors ("color bled from day," "whispers of leaves") contrast with clich√©d haunted house tropes. Central tension resolved too neatly for lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mix of fresh elements (botanical horror) and well-worn tropes (soul-devouring houses). Avoids overt purple prose but slips into formulaic ghostly phenomena. Emotional nuance replaces explicit declarations, but certain transitions (blood drive backstory) feel convenient rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent execution of gothic short fiction template with clever final twist. Elements service plot mechanics rather than deeper thematic exploration. Lingering effect emerges from tonal consistency rather than profound insight; well-crafted but not groundbreaking.</comment>
