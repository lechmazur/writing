<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight investigative arc with meaningful cause-effect chains. Ending resolution feels slightly compressed but maintains narrative cohesion within constraints. Pacing balances atmospheric reflection with forward momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-oil palace setting masterfully merges historical and futuristic elements. Sensory details like coiling holographic dragons and debris-strewn sunlight create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (truth/illusion, light/shadow) and symbolic objects achieve thematic resonance. Ending balances closure with lingering conceptual tension about historical authenticity. Subtext about cultural sanitization enriches narrative.</comment>
