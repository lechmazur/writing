<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's transformation driven by whispers and discoveries feels somewhat abrupt despite thematic resonance. Motivational shift from intellectual pursuit to cultural restitution is clear but lacks nuanced inner conflict depiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a redemptive arc with logical cause-effect relationships, though rapid progression from hallucinations to reconciliation lacks gradual tension release. Subway bookending provides coherence despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere magnificently realized through tactile descriptions of the attic's "precarious towers" and whispered auditory phenomena. Sensory contrast between sterile "empty abundance" and organic memory anchors elevates thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative use of botanical symbolism as cultural relic creates layered metaphor. Subtext about colonial erasure through plant collection adds intellectual weight. Ending's quiet catharsis privileges thematic over emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but employs familiar haunted space archetypes with insufficient subversion. Prose balances poetic precision ("flowers thought extinct") with mechanical phrasing ("proper ceremonies"). Emotional restraint occasionally feels calculated rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified meditation on cultural restitution. Subtle revelation mechanics and symbolic economy demonstrate authorial control. Lingering questions about institutional complicity enhance thematic longevity despite conventional structural scaffolding.</comment>
