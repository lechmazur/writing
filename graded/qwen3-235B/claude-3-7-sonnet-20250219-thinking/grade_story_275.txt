<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but predictable; time compression lacks sufficient emotional weight to fully satisfy narrative arc within the word constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Contains overwrought metaphors ("specters...begging for warmth") and occasionally mechanical pacing; certain descriptors risk poetic redundancy rather than innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competently unified but not groundbreaking; assigned elements serve the narrative more than vice versa, though some conceptual connections remain superficial.</comment>
