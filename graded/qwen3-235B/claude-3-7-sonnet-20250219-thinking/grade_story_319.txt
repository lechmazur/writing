<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation (escape from fate) drives nuanced actions (duality of hope/despair), though inner conflict could be deeper. The frailty as both physical condition and metaphorical burden is well-integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The transformation and alchemy phial drive the plot effectively, but pacing in the escape sequence feels slightly compressed. The arc from captivity to escape is coherent within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, sensorily immersive setting (salt, storm, mist) creates visceral atmosphere. The tidal island’s symbolism as a liminal space is intricately woven into theme and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (tide as fate, bark messages as rebellion) and emotional subtext elevate the story. Slightly lacks deeper thematic complexity but maintains strong emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and organic imagery avoid clichés. Prose is purposeful but occasionally leans on slightly overused atmospheric descriptors (e.g., "sour-smelling"). Overall distinctive stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Excellent cohesion among elements. Each component serves the theme/tension. Brevity enhances urgency. Leaves lingering questions about identity and transformation.</comment>
