<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Redemption arc is clear but under-detailed; internal conflict hinted but thinly developed. Tactile reactions to spectacles show some depth but motivations occasionally feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong framing device (letter to redemption) but pacing compresses key emotional beats. Causal links solid though some transitions (e.g. spectacles granting visions) lack explanation, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (blood-colored sunset, muddy paddies) enrich atmosphere, but cultural specificity feels borrowed rather than immersive. Spectacles' magical realism poorly connected to castle's history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphor (gardening as atonement) balances show/tell well. Ending resonates thematically but "corroded rapture" phrasing leans too on-the-nose for subtle literary work.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but redemption template remains evident. Prose remains lean with few clich√©s; overly poetic descriptors ("tortoiseshell frames, lenses clouded with age") border on ornate. Subtext of cyclical violence vs. growth feels original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity between elements (spectacles, planting, brokenness) but execution uneven. Some assigned elements (monk) underperform; brevity enhances metaphor but sacrifices character nuance.</comment>
