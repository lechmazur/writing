<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is consistent and motivated, but lacks deeper exploration of how "assertively meek" influences decisions or interactions beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing is generally effective within constraints, though the ending feels abrupt. Plot connections are logical but resolution lacks completeness in such a tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting is competent but atmospheric details are occasionally generic. Sensory elements are present but underdeveloped for full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme is clear and symbolism works, but emotional impact remains surface-level. Ending is purposeful but lacks lingering resonance beyond hope motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but combines familiar tropes (VR danger, ancient wisdom) with modest originality. Language stays purposeful without slipping into formality or vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative but few transcend basic plot utility. Some components (tapestry, VR) deepen theme more effectively than others (firework moment).</comment>
