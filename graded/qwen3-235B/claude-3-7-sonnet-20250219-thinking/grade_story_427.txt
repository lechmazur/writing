<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually distinct but lack psychological depth; Mercer’s motivation is intriguing but underexplored, while Verity’s role feels archetypal rather than nuanced. The sock and mechanical arm hint at deeper trauma/identity but remain symbolic rather than emotionally integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to duel framework but lacks organic pacing; abrupt shifts (applause reveal, device activation) undermine cause-effect logic. The lighthouse setting provides dramatic enclosure but feels underutilized as a narrative pressure point. Closure relies too heavily on spectacle over emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative in patches (e.g., “sea mist,” copper coils) but inconsistent; tone oscillates between gothic and clinical without merging effectively. Sensory details lean on clichéd decay motifs (salt-stained windows, dusty furniture) rather than unique, immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but inconsistent—strong metaphors (“tide against glass”) coexist with flat declarations (“became what he had always sought”). Subtext about knowledge ethics is present but undercut by on-the-nose dialogue. Ending’s dream-weaving spectacle prioritizes imagery over thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids outright tropes but relies on quasi-mystical “consciousness extract” deus ex machina. Mechanical enhancements and rogue philosophers are familiar concepts but framed through fresh tension between empirical measurement and abstraction. Purple prose tendencies (“coded desperation”) occasionally dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fails to harmonize ambitious elements into a unified whole; philosophical stakes intrigue but lack emotional stakes. The duel’s resolution hinges on gimmicks (hidden vials, applause recording) rather than earned insight. Ambition outpaces execution, leaving a sense of untapped potential.</comment>
