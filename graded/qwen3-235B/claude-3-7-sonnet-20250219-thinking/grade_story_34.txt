<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fully realized as a symbol but emotionally distant; motivations are clear but lack tangible inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent ritual structure with thematic resolution, but lacks traditional rising action; cyclical nature serves concept but risks narrative stasis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with synesthetic details like "mysterious familiarity," though occasional abstractions dilute physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (pendant as memory vessel, anvil as creation tool) balanced against overreliance on poetic abstraction; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original interdimensional logic subverts expectations, but some phrases ("precisely calibrated hope") veer into self-aware ornamentation; emotional nuance occasionally explicit rather than revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements synergize thematically but occasionally feel checklist-derived; brevity serves mythic tone while slightly limiting character depth.</comment>
