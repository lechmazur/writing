<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh tech/humanity intersections; some phrases ("fragrant possibilities") flirt with purple prose, but unique voice and subverted caretaker tropes elevate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrated with thematic cohesion, though story leans on premise over execution; brevity serves tone but limits narrative depth; memorable concept with room for nuance.</comment>
