<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Characters are effectively rendered but lack deeper psychological complexity; the stoic radio operator's vulnerability feels earned but underexplored. The motivation for emotional isolation aligns with actions, yet backstory remains thinly implied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure connects beginning (wallet finding) to end (emotional transformation), but rushed pacing in the beekeeper encounter; logical cause-effect through wallet recovery, though the 500-word limit strains full emotional payoff. Some narrative jumps feel convenient rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory atmosphere with honeyed light and apiary details; setting meaningfully contrasts with characters' emotional states. Beekeeping mesh as metaphor for emotional barriers is effective. Timeframe of post-band midnight enhances melancholic tone. Overly picturesque descriptions occasionally threaten verisimilitude.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paper airplane as metaphor for unsent emotions adds thematic depth. Dialogue maintains natural rhythm despite some on-the-nose revelations. Ending shows character growth through specific details (honey-scented broadcasts). Conflicts remain small-scale but resonant; theme of mediated connection effectively 'shown' through radio/wallet exchanges.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids radio drama clich√©s through precise details (apiary, honey tea), but "pompous humility" borders on trope. Sensory descriptions generally vivid without excess. Emotional subtext emerges through gesture rather than exposition, though transformation feels somewhat rapid. Metaphors fresh but occasionally heavy-handed (tombstone hives).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly thematically if not always structurally; brief length enhances intimacy. Emotional resonance lingers but lacks gut-punch depth. Character epiphanies feel honest rather than contrived. The integration of object (wallet) and concept (emotional barriers) demonstrates creative thinking within constraints.</comment>
