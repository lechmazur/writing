<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's apathy and suppressed yearning are well-established through physical details and internal monologue, but transformation feels slightly rushed without deeper exploration of emotional triggers. The assigned attribute ("fiercely apathetic") shapes the narrative effectively, though voice lacks distinctiveness typical of first-person introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure is clear - resignation sparks internal conflict resolved by departure. Meteor showers as recurring motif provide cohesion. Pacing feels slightly compressed; Tomas’s resignation as catalyst feels underdeveloped but not disruptive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere of isolation and celestial mysticism works well. Sensory details (sword hilt, meteor light) are evocative but sparse. Floating setting enhances thematic duality between liberation and entrapment. Deeper environmental texture could strengthen mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical layer (meteors as suppressed hope) elevates narrative. Subtext about institutional fear vs. rebellion resonates. Ending provides satisfying thematic resolution, though emotional impact is somewhat muted by restrained prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No overt clichés; metaphors feel fresh (tears of gods vs. navigational guides). Avoids excessive prose while maintaining poetic precision. Character motivations avoid algorithmic logic through ambiguous tension between fear and desire. Shows distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve theme of internal rebellion. Compact form feels intentional, with metaphorical density compensating for brevity. Leaves lingering questions about institutionalized complacency but could deepen psychological complexity.</comment>
