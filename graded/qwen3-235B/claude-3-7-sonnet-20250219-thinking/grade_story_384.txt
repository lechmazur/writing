<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but thinly developed. Elena’s dual identity lacks emotional depth; her actions feel plot-driven rather than organically tied to her psychology. The "frantic cook" aspect is underexploited thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has structural clarity but relies on contrived convenience (e.g., tremor timing). The arc is complete but rushed, with uneven pacing in the word limit. The subversion action strains believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are competently sketched (steel kitchen vs. wood stick, tremor sensory details), but lacks visceral immersion. The centuries-of-dust motif is underused in worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Themes are clear but unlayered. Ending provides emotional payout yet feels manipulative. Shows craft (symbolism of stick/chef’s tools) but lacks subtext depth. The "root of illusions" theme is bluntly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in premise but leans on "lone truth-teller vs. establishment" tropes. Writing style is generally crisp but occasionally veers into melodrama. The stick’s notches as a method feel contrived but inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story functions but lacks singularity. Some elements (pencil eraser, letters) feel checklisted. The concept’s twist is memorable but underserved by execution. The brevity exposes underdeveloped threads.</comment>
