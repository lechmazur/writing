<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Limited psychological depth; motivation is clear but defined by assigned traits rather than internal conflict. Ritualistic actions demonstrate duty, but character voice remains underdeveloped despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Circular structure with storm-driven timing shows coherence, but compressed format forces narrative shortcuts. The pivotal discovery feels rushed, sacrificing visceral impact for conceptual resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storm-battered lighthouse generates rich sensory dissonance between raucous revelry below and arcane operations above. Atmospheric details are vivid but occasionally overshadow character immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (constellations-as-library, rain-as-key) create mythic resonance. The ending lacks emotional catharsis but succeeds through lingering cosmic implication rather than overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mythic framework avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "keeper of hidden knowledge" tropes. Some descriptions border on ornate abstraction but maintain stylistic consistency throughout. Subtext about preserving forgotten origins feels genuinely provocative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements function as narrative gears rather than thematic extensions. The lighthouse-as-archival-mechanism conceit elevates cohesion, though cosmic revelations risk becoming mere conceptual artifice.</comment>
