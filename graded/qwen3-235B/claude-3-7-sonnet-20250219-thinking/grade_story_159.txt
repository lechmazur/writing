<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but inconsistently realized; Corvus's philosophical detachment feels contrived rather than earned, and supporting characters lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function logically but suffer from compressed pacing - the betrayal's resolution feels abrupt despite effective thematic symmetry between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is gorgeously rendered through precise sensory details (floating lanterns refracting light, tactile sands) but slightly undermined by inconsistent fantastical logic in spatial descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent central metaphor of perspective operates on multiple levels; dialogue occasionally veers toward didacticism but strong symbolic imagery and thematic payoff compensate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but contains moments of overly ornate description that border on purple prose; emotional beats could be more nuanced, with some elements feeling semi-predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story successfully weaves disparate elements into cohesive narrative with lingering thematic weight, though thematic unity occasionally sacrifices deeper psychological complexity in character treatment.</comment>
