<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's apathy is established but motivation shift feels underexplored. Actions align with traits, but emotional depth lacks nuance. Voice is distinct but superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically, but pacing feels slightly rushed in critical transformation moments. Connections between elements are coherent but lack narrative tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stylistic worldbuilding is strong (dying god imagery, lighthouse studio) but inconsistent atmospheric details—some sensory elements dazzle while others fade.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures through specific imagery (phosphorescent stones, dimensional blueprints). No generic descriptors—every element serves thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements serve the story organically despite constraints. The brevity amplifies thematic focus. Leaves conceptual resonance about paradoxical proactivity through indolence.</comment>
