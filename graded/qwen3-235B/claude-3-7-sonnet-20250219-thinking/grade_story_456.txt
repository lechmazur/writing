<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Limited exploration of Mei's inner conflict; transformation from detached observer to enlightened participant lacks emotional nuance despite clear thematic ties to cosmic cycles. Assigned trait of "neutrally passionate" surfaces but isn't fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear plot satisfies short-form constraints but relies on conceptual symmetry (funeral arrangements ↔ supernovas) rather than earned emotional beats. The lantern's flicker as narrative timer works efficiently but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering—"luminescent stone," petals dropping into void, guttering flame—creates haunting metaphysical texture. Setting actively shapes thematic explorations rather than merely decorating them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent metaphoric scaffolding (candle's flame as death-as-process, floral decay mirroring cosmic patterns) elevates thematic resonance. Ending avoids sentimentality by circling back to tactile floral arrangements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise skillfully merges floristry with astrophysical philosophy. Avoids full AI-tropes through specific details (e.g., weight of "typed pages") but occasionally falters with cosmic descriptors that feel like conceptual shorthand rather than lived language. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration skillful if occasionally schematic. Compression works to the story's advantage, suggesting depth rather than exhaustively explicating it. Lingering impact resides in conceptual parallels rather than character specificity.</comment>
