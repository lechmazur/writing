<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped internal conflict; character's nervousness and grandfather's legacy drive actions, but emotional layers remain superficial. Motivation to "find purpose" lacks nuanced psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pivotal escape feels rushed. Candle-deadline mechanism is underutilized tension. Ending resolution sacrifices emotional weight for efficiency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush bacterial dystopia contrasts with wilderness effectively. Over-reliance on "glowing" imagery; inconsistent sensory engagement beyond visual descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (music vs. machinery) resonate, but thematic depth undercut by didactic undertones. Ending's sincerity lacks preparation. Strong imagery compensates for uneven subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bacterial setting feels original but leans on post-apocalyptic tropes. Star navigation and photo device occasionally verge on mechanical plotting rather than organic character-driven choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but lack revelatory synergy. Tone control is precise, yet emotional resonance remains surface-level despite strong atmospheric foundation.</comment>
