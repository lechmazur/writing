<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's scholarly/traditional duality remains underexplored; motivations are clear but psychologically simplistic. Emotional reactions lack nuanced layering beneath the surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arc present but compressed—the epiphany about recipes arrives abruptly without sufficient preparatory groundwork for maximum impact in the restricted space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful sensory layering creates a palpable atmosphere where cold archive spaces mirror emotional duality; the fading handkerchief and ephemeral snowflakes work as organic extensions of the setting's thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative use of food-as-language metaphor and cyclical impermanence motif elevate the narrative; some emotional beats could be more subtly rendered rather than explicitly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Occasional ornate phrasing ("memories stirred like embers") veers toward cliché, but the core concept of a culinary cipher in a hopscotch board demonstrates genuine inventiveness unmarred by formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tight integration of atmospheric details elevates the work above mere conceptual exercise, but the narrative remains more conceptually impressive than viscerally transformative as required for top-tier distinction.</comment>
