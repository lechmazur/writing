<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters lack psychological depth; motivations revealed but not fully earned. Mallory’s transformation feels abrupt despite established trauma. Elian remains enigmatic rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves swiftly but pivotal moments (grotto entrance, rebellion purpose) strain credulity. Coherence maintains but pacing falters during genre shifts (domestic to fantastical). Ending ties together but feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Potent imagery in grotto (dripping starlight, psychic crystals) and radio booth, but sensory details uneven. Cooking class lacks atmospheric contrast to supernatural elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (pawnlessness as resistance) adds thematic weight. Shows more than tells through chessboard and radio metaphors. Emotional resonance present but occasionally undercut by exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Blends paranormal and political tropes with partial success—guardian shadows and rebellion feel derivative. Dialogue avoids cliché but writing occasionally turns overly ornate ("oozing black mercury"). Metaphors fresh but unevenly deployed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Combines elements cleverly but cohesion suffers—culinary class as catalyst feels arbitrary. Story’s brevity sharpens emotional beats yet weakens worldbuilding. Lingering impression stems from themes more than execution.</comment>
