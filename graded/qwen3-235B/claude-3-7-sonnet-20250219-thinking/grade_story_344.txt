<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ambiguous motivation for Mara's career choice undermines character logic; claustrophobia's psychological impact remains superficial beneath poetic descriptions; Jin's sudden diagnostic wisdom lacks character justification.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot trajectory flattens complexity of fear resolution; jam tasting as therapeutic method poorly integrated with atmospheric setting; emotional arc accelerated through pivotal moments without earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Floating tea house's physical laws inconsistently rendered; sensory details beautiful but disconnected from Mara's psychological state; atmosphere prioritizes aesthetic over narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of preserved fruit as emotional cartography offers resonant possibility but remains under-actualized; ending lacks the subversive complexity hinted in Jin's wisdom.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Verdant descriptions occasionally dissolve into purple prose; emotional healing adheres to predictable arc despite unusual setting; some dialogue ("fear isn't memory") feels aphoristic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High-concept elements compete for narrative space; thematic exploration of fear-as-anticipation merits deeper interrogation; polished prose doesn't fully compensate for schematic emotional mechanics.</comment>
