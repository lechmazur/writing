<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haruo's motivation as a solitary orchardist mourning a lost natural world is clear and consistent, with his key symbolizing his tether to history. Mei's role as a curiosity-driven child feels authentic, though her parents remain underdeveloped. Their dynamic reveals depth through shared actions (polishing apples, exchanging seeds) rather than explicit exposition, but secondary characters lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a gradual emotional arc from isolation to cautious hope, driven by Mei's persistent presence. Pacing is efficient though slightly compressed; the climax (seed exchange) feels earned. The cyberpunk/organic contrast frames cause and effect naturally. However, the timeframe's mention ("hush between heartbeats") doesn't fully integrate into structural momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Neo-Tokyo's vertical cityscape contrasts vividly with the rooftop garden's sensory details (feel of soil, taste of heirloom apples). The atmosphere of quiet rebellion against a disconnected world is palpable through evocative imagery. If the setting were removed, the story would collapse—its cyberpunk dystopia defines every interaction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through restrained storytelling—e.g., "polishing an extra apple" implies affection without sentimentality. Metaphors (key as lost heritage, interconnected orchards as resistance) add depth. The ending avoids heavy-handedness, letting the seed symbolize hope. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with Mei's "whys" serving as thematic refrains.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>While conceptually fresh, the story leans on recognizable tropes (lonely gardener, precocious child) without fully subverting them. Descriptions are generally vivid but occasionally border on generic ("neon glow"). The integration of tech elements (retinal scans, data miners) feels somewhat schematic rather than organically tied to character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story coherently balances assigned elements, though a few (e.g., "excited restraint") are underutilized. Its brevity serves the intimate scope, and the closing seed gift suggests broader implications without overreaching. The thematic contrast between technology and nature remains its strongest throughline, though some conceptual corners feel slightly smoothed by convention.</comment>
