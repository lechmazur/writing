<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Professor Wei's transition from emotionless to emotionally curious lacks psychological nuance; her scientific rigor dominates but fails to convey internal conflict with sufficient complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot connects veil discovery to rebellion logically but feels compressed; the pivotal realization about emotions occurs too abruptly without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Krystalline coldness of the setting mirrors emotional sterility; sensory details like frost-covered lace and melting snowflakes enhance atmosphere, though the city and idol remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (snowflakes/emotions, falling idol) are effective but occasionally heavy-handed; the theme of emotion as fundamental to humanity resonates, though subtext remains thin.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "rogue scientist discovers humanity" trope; language balances poetic imagery (crystal shadows) with sterile exposition, though some phrases feel overworked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story's ambition exceeds its brevity—many elements feel like scaffolding for a longer narrative; thematic cohesion is strong, but emotional resonance and character depth suffer from word constraints.</comment>
