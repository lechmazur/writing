<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional core and recognizable motivation, but limited character evolution beyond regret resolution. Inner conflict remains underdeveloped despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Impressive structural symmetry between frost patterns and quantum pathways. Overly tidy time-manipulation mechanics threaten coherence but are forgiven through poetic logic. Pacing mostly effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory alchemy in waterwall light and frost textures. The library's impossible physics maintain consistent wonder. Atmosphere immaculately supports existential themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical recursion between transient art forms and eternal regret. Haunting temporal doubling creates emotional resonance beyond predictable time-travel tropes. Subtext-rich leaf symbolism elevates craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre platitudes through unexpected leaf/firework symbology. Occasional ornate phrasing ("taffy in amber light") borders on excess but maintains stylistic distinctness. Conceptual freshness without overt formula writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Each element organically advances both plot and theme. Technical precision in combining fantastical elements with emotional realism. Leaves lingering meditation on impermanence through layered narrative architecture.</comment>
