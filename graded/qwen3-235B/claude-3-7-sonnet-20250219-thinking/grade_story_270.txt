<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation to harness the ephemeral is deeply consistent with his cynicism-turned-devotion; the shift from arrogance to humility is convincingly realized through his interactions with the globe and echoes. His distinct voice emerges through introspective narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot progression via ritual and celestial alignment is logical and purposeful. The tight word count accommodates a clear arc—from isolation to connection—with precise pacing and cause-effect coherence in the globe's awakening and thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive: frost, crashing waves, and whispered voices evoke tactile and auditory sensory details. The lighthouse setting and borrowed-century timeframe enhance the melancholic tone and theme of shared isolation seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance through metaphor (bridge between worlds) and symbolism (dormant globe). The ending transcends surface narrative, emphasizing humility over control. Subtext about legacy and connection is layered and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes (e.g., magic as nostalgia rather than spectacle). Sensory details are vivid, not generic.
