<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tomás’s steady resolve and connection to the magnifying glass provide clear motivation, but "whimsical" feels underdeveloped in actions beyond journal illustrations; emotional depth present but slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from Father Domingo’s confession to the ritualistic resolution, with cause-effect clear. Pacing tight yet coherent, though the sudden spectral vision risks feeling abrupt without more foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (spectral fires, splintered wood, prism light) immerse readers. The blend of ancient/modern settings enhances thematic tension, with tone balancing reverence and quiet urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through symbolism (magnifying glass as generational bridge, spiral as liminal space). Ending feels earned, themes of memory/ritual resonate beyond plot, with layered subtext about erasure vs. preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original in blending Aztec mythology with modern conflict, avoiding overt clichés. Metaphors fresh (sunlight prisms as sacred revelation) but occasionally leans on "dancing illustrations" as overly whimsical. Emotional nuance outweighs explicit tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively interwoven—the magnifying glass, temple setting, and overlapping worlds drive both plot and theme. The ending lingers thoughtfully, with style purposeful and evocative within constraints.</comment>
