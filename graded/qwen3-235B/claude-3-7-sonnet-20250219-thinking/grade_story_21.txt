<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Chen's traits are present but lack psychological depth; his trauma informs his actions but the motivations feel slightly surface-level compared to the story's conceptual complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently through high-concept revelations but the final choice feels underexplored thematically; the revenge manipulation twist is compelling yet slightly rushed within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually rich setting details (water-stained ceilings, drum circles) effectively evoke decay and ritual; the children's theater-as-key conceit is potent but slightly under-exploited for emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story delivers significant emotional and philosophical impact through its ironic subversion of revenge tropes; the final line crystallizes the theme with memorable existential weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements, though the genetic pattern decoding remains more intellectual than emotionally visceral; the ending's thematic resonance outweighs minor structural compression issues.</comment>
