<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Edwin’s motivation (saving his sister) is clear, but his internal conflict (rigidity vs. empathy) feels occasionally underdeveloped despite key moments of transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc but feels slightly compressed; the resolution with the sister’s recovery is abrupt, lacking deeper exploration of the transformation’s consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (e.g., "emerald crown," "vines wrapping wrists") immerse the reader, though some descriptions verge on overly ornate.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (seed/light bulb as empathy) and emotional resonance elevate the narrative; the ending is satisfying but could better integrate the story’s more fantastical elements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar "rigid-to-redemptive" arcs; metaphors (e.g., "steel trap heart") feel fresh, though some phrasing ("ferns that dripped with possibility") risks overwroughtness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements (Tesla bulb, witchcraft) creates thematic depth; brevity leaves certain threads unresolved, but the story lingers as a poignant allegory.</comment>
