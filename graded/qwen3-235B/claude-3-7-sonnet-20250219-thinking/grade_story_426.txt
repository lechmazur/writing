<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s motivations and traits connect logically but lack nuanced exploration of her internal conflict between past genius and current secrecy; the "angrily peaceful" attribute is underexploited beyond superficial descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression and resolution, but the sudden emergence of a community in the climax feels underdeveloped despite tight pacing; the embedded formulas as a driving force works cohesively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant (e.g., decay mirroring forgotten medicine, sound system repurposed for preservation), though the "haunted" setting occasionally verges on Gothic cliché without deeper symbolic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional weight through subtext (e.g., teapot fractures symbolizing endangered heritage, music as clandestine pedagogy); the ending’s communal solidarity delivers a memorable thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing; combines unexpected elements (algorithms, folk remedies, haunted parks) with originality; sensory details (sound of cracked teapot, cracked playlists) serve both plot and theme without redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with most elements organically tied to theme and character; marathon training feels slightly extraneous compared to other elements; ending prompts reflection on communal preservation vs. individual legacy.</comment>
