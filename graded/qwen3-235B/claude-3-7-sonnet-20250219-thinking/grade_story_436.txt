<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Valen's grief and hope drive his actions credibly; sister’s awakening feels earned but underexplored. Plastic spoon ties to backstory but requires deeper integration into character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Library deadline creates urgency, potion-making drives plot, and climax resolves core conflict. Minor pacing clunkiness in exposition-heavy middle; ending ties arcs succinctly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Desertic floating fortress evokes exile’s harsh beauty through vivid heat mirages, scent of herbs, and oppressive silence. Atmosphere masterfully amplifies emotional stakes without over-explanation.</comment>
