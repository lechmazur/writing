<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Merina's ambivalence as a prophet is clear but underexplored; her motivations align with her actions but lack psychological depth. The marbles' fractures mirror her internal conflict, yet her voice remains more symbolic than humanely conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a functional arc (discovery → restoration → sacrifice) but feels compressed. The jigsaw-marble connection drives the action logically, though the shift to decompression prophecy and her sacrifice occurs abruptly, losing emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lunar colony's sterile, claustrophobic atmosphere—recycled air, regolith quarters, and artificial lighting—effectively amplifies the protagonist's burden, though sensory details remain sparse beyond visual descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor (marbles/cracked destiny) and poignant ending. Crafts a haunting theme of self-sacrifice, but the "reshaping fate" trope follows predictable mythic patterns rather than offering radical innovation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh integration of jigsaw/marble concept avoids formulaicity, but moments of ornate abstraction ("cosmic scoreboard") edge into overwrought symbolism. Avoids most AI hallmarks but relies on familiar tropes (doomed prophet, noble sacrifice).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Holistic integration of elements creates conceptual cohesion (marbles, lunar decay, fragmented puzzles). The fatalistic tone lingers, but the story occasionally strains under the weight of its abstract themes vs. concrete execution.</comment>
