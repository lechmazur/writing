<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization leans heavily on stated traits rather than demonstrated behaviors; "hesitant swordsman" is inconsistently applied, with sword use feeling perfunctory. Motivation for restoring systems lacks visceral connection to the orchard solitude. Internal conflict between rancor and resolve remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Limited word count strains pacing: burning of texts feels abrupt, ritual execution lacks tension. Plot hinges on esoteric logic that feels unearned. Emergence through crab shells resolves conceptually but sacrifices narrative urgency. Cause-effect between archivists filing scrolls and portal mechanics remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Geothermal vents create striking visual contrasts but environmental details like orchard fruit textures or shell-scraping sounds go missing. Atmosphere effectively merges impermanence (steam) and preservation (frozen tundra) to mirror theme. Sensory immersion remains partial despite strong foundational imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors of shedding/transition gain depth through crab-sword parallels and postcard metamorphosis. Ending avoids pat resolution by leaving postcard as existential placeholder. Subtext about archival erasure resonates, but emotional impact weakens from excessive exposition rather than organic character reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hermit crab motif offers clever interdimensional mechanics but borders on mechanical convenience rather than mythic logic. Some phrases ("steaming breath of vents") verge on clich√©. Avoids fantasy templates through specific geography yet occasionally relies on "reluctant hero" tropes. Tone balances wonder and bitterness without tipping into melodrama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than intersect synergistically - orchard isolation doesn't fully deepen motivation to restore systems. Brief length accentuates thematic symmetry (blank postcard to blank postcard) but leaves emotional arcs abbreviated. Provokes intellectual curiosity about preservation more than visceral investment.</comment>
