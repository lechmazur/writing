<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent with her 'broke swashbuckler' status, but emotional complexity feels slightly surface-level despite effective use of the hatpin as both heirloom and narrative tool.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves completeness within constraints, with the marble-chalking method driving the narrative forward cohesively. Pacing avoids feeling rushed but could explore stakes more deeply.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (neon, decay, rain) create immersive atmosphere. Tension between cyberpunk grit and fragile hope reinforces tone, though secondary settings lack depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through subtext (hatpin as care/rebellion) and irony (disguised heroism). Literary devices enhance themes without overuse. Ending balances resolution with lingering humanity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls (e.g., purple prose, illogical jumps) and uses familiar tropes (cyberpunk outcasts, orphan shelters) with twists through specific details like marbles as code. Some reliance on established genre aesthetics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like the shelter, hatpin, and marbles feel integrally tied to story logic. While brief, the length heightens tension rather than limiting impact, with themes of concealed compassion resonating post-reading.</comment>
