<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ellis's motivation to protect rather than expose is consistent, but lacks deeper psychological complexity; the "suspiciously trusting" trait is demonstrated but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently through discovery, but the fateful encounter's resolution feels rushed within the word limit; the candle-burn method drives progression but lacks technical specificity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned lab with broken mirrors creates disorienting, haunting atmosphere; autumn sensory details (e.g., earthworms, leaf rustling) ground the surreal elements in tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evoke-able mystery through subtext (protecting "secrets until worthy"); writing style uses precise imagery ("frozen waterfalls of broken light") but occasionally veers into familiar tropes like glowing eyes in darkness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through inversion (protector vs. exploiter), but methods (e.g., candle wick analysis) feel contrived; fresh metaphors ("mirror-maze multiplicities") contrast with predictable "luminous creature" design.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively despite constraints; constrained third-person tightens focus, though the brevity occasionally flattens emotional stakes; closing meditation on secrecy lingers.</comment>
