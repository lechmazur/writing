<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and traits are present but lack depth beyond assigned elements; Tomas's consistency stems from devotion but doesn't evolve beyond that anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with purposeful progression toward revelation, though some connections between chance encounters and central themes feel underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with sensory details (whispering trees, charged air), though shifting paths and contradictions in the orchard could be more tightly woven into the central premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant use of literary devices (imagery, symbolism) and suggestive subtext elevate the story, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by overt exposition about the goddess.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>No formulaic transitions or glaring repetitions; tone and style remain cohesive. Some descriptions (e.g., "impossible landscapes") border on generality but do not detract significantly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively, with each component serving thematic or atmospheric goals. Brief length feels intentional, though the endingâ€™s abstract resolution may leave some readers wanting.</comment>
