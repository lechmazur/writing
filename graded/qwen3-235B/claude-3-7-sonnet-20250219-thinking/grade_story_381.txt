<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is functional but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth. The intersection of necromancy and old movies is creative, but emotional stakes remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arc of exploration and resolution, but lacks rising tension or meaningful conflict. The cave mapping serves as a structural backbone but feels more like a catalog than a dynamic narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with crystalline imagery and spectral details, but over-reliance on metaphors strains immersion. The time frame's futuristic nostalgia requires more precise anchoring to avoid tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storytelling has emotional resonance through themes of memory preservation. Memorable metaphors (cinema as bridge between life/death) elevate the narrative, though the ending’s poeticism slightly outpaces its narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi necromancy and film obsession avoids genre clichés. Minimal purple prose missteps, but the baseball cap and "scarcely abundant" descriptors verge on generic. Overall fresh perspective with human-adjacent nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted. The crystal cave and cinematic necromancy drive the story, while minor elements (cap, "between sets") feel disposable. Strong thematic foundation but lacks structural innovation.</comment>
