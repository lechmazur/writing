<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prince Aldrin’s motivation (altruistic royalty vs. exile) is clear but underexplored emotionally; his connection to the mortar lacks visceral reaction. Elara’s introduction feels narrative-convenient rather than psychologically textured.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on snowstorm-induced encounter, which feels overly deterministic; transformation into a healing practice is abrupt. The ending resolution satisfies thematically but sacrifices pacing nuance within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting evokes melancholy with sensory details (frost-covered glass, dust in light) but over-relies on gothic tropes. Atmosphere supports tone of isolation but underdevelops regional specifics of the borderlands.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of healing and purpose resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by overtly didactic dialogue (“The cure for loneliness...”). Symbolism (key, mortar) feels aspirational rather than organically realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story leans on archetypal motifs (exiled prince, mystical healer) without subversion. Phrases like “kingdom of two” verge on cliché; descriptions occasionally lapse into ornamental abstraction (“dance of chance and destiny”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements like the mortar/pestle and snowstorm drive the plot but feel imposed rather than integrated. The self-contained ending lacks lingering ambiguity; concept-to-character balance remains uneven.</comment>
