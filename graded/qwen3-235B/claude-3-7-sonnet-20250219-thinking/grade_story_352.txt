<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character shows surface traits but lacks psychological depth; motivations are clear but inconsistently embodied through action. The "blithe discontent" feels more like posture than internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc of preservation but sacrifices emotional stakes for atmospheric flourishes. The tight word limit reveals more poetic resonance than narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid synesthetic details that merge wonder with decay. The dying cosmos atmosphere permeates every element, creating immersive emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</comment>Story employs elegant metaphors and emotional resonance without descending into sentimentality. The ending lingers but lacks full thematic payoff from conceptual richness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptual fusion (musical steganography through ink), avoiding genre tropes. Avoids purple prose through precise, unconventional imagery like "particles glittering like tiny constellations."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting elegy for cultural memory. Each component serves the central metaphor without feeling forced, with the brief format amplifying cosmic intimacy.</comment>
