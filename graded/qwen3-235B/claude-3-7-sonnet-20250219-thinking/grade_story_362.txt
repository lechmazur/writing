<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Oracle's traits are consistent but motivations remain superficial; her manipulation is stated rather than evidenced through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but relies on exposition-heavy dialogue; the cyclical time concept shapes structure but the ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich tactile details (dusty glass, amber shadows) and historical layers create atmosphere; the terrarium-as-time-vessel concept elevates the setting's function.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through Mesopotamian specifics and time-as-specimen metaphor, but oracle archetype remains under-interrogated; some ornate descriptions lack precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements synergize visually but lack thematic cohesion; brevity serves mystery but limits character resonance or philosophical exploration.</comment>
