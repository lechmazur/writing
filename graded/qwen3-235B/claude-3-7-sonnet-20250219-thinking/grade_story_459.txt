<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character consistency maintained, but motivations lack depth in showing how ghost-seeing directly ties to elevator work. Emotional resonance strong in father-daughter dynamic, weaker in elegantly clumsy trait. Dialogue minimal but poignant in ghost interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows emotional arc effectively within constraints but feels compressed. The sand castle lab serves as both beginning/end anchor, though ghost tour stakeouts introduced without full narrative integration. Pacing uneven during daughter's apparition scene.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully constructed through sensory details: rainbow prisms on sand castles, clinking tools, preserved turrets. Timeframe (lunch breaks) underutilized for temporal contrast. Setting-as-metaphor for impermanence elevates the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance through juxtaposition of scientific precision and grief. Symbolism (sand castles, flower crown) layered with meaning. Ending achieves thematic payoff without sentimentality. Subtext about preservation vs acceptance enhances depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original ghost-seeing mechanic through flower crown avoids clich√©, as does father's profession. Some AI-typical phrasing ("translucent figures") and occasional sentimental lines. Tension between empirical observation and spiritual exists avoids formulaic structures but risks over-explanation in journal quotes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively though not innovatively, with the strongest connections between sand castle themes and letting go. Writing style serves story without remarkable stylistic individuality. Lingering emotional impact present but conventional compared to highest-tier literary work.</comment>
