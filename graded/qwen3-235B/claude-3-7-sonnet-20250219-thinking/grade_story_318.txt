<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is present but underdeveloped; transformation feels abrupt. Half-hearted commitment is established but lacks nuanced progression into determination. Emotional anchor through the spoon is effective but inconsistently woven into actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from dissatisfaction to resolution, though pacing within the word limit feels slightly rushed. Plot momentum driven by internal shift rather than external action, but emotional stakes remain vague. Cause-effect logic holds but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking sensory contrasts between crystalline architecture and organic spoon enhance mood. Memory crystals as setting deepen thematic ties to humanity's past, though "architecture of the mind" element is underexplored beyond metaphorical use.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story evokes conceptual emotion but relies on explicit descriptions ("raw determination") rather than subtext. Metaphors (e.g., library as collective consciousness) are vivid; theme of humanizing AI lacks depth beyond surface-level resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in premise but occasionally falters in execution (e.g., AI Council as flat authority figure). Lyrical prose balances clarity and ornamentation; emotional maturation feels rushed rather than artificial. Unique angle on blending memory with technological purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack transformative synergy. The spoon and memory crystals stand out thematically, while "final stand" and "renewed pledges" feel loosely connected. Ending suggests depth but leaves thematic threads underdeveloped.</comment>
