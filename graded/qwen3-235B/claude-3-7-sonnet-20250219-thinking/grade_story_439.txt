<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's muteness drives their observational skill and motivation, but lacks emotional depth beyond enabling plot functions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear progression, but relies on exposition in the guidebook rather than organic cause-and-effect. Satisfying cyclical ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subverts "chosen one" trope through silent bridge-building rather than conquest. Sensory details specific rather than generic. Avoids clich√© resolutions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock elegantly (comet timings, snow, opera house acoustics), creating layered metaphor for neurodivergent communication. Stylistic voice purposeful.</comment>
