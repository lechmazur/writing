<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are mostly coherent but some transitions from locksmith to royal heir feel slightly underexplored; the core conflict between past and present identities could use more nuanced internal reflection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing falters slightly in compressing backstory; the ending feels earned but the rapid shift from pottery class to throne reclaiming stretches feasibility within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory worldbuilding with labyrinth orchards and twilight atmosphere; the colonial rooftop setting creates unique spatial tension between intimacy and surveillance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid symbolism (locks/thrones/hunting) elevates narrative; ending resonates thematically but lacks full emotional payoff from character arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate descriptors like "delightfully menacing" without fully contextualizing them; hunting method preservation feels more integrated than throne concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and thematic cohesion elevate despite minor pacing issues; the fusion of domestic craft with royal legacy offers fresh narrative possibilities.</comment>
