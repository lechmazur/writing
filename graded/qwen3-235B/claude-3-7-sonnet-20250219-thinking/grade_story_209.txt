<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are emotionally resonant but some traits (e.g., "seasoned woodsman") aren't deeply tied to his actions. The core confession feels earned but could benefit from earlier hints. The hairbrush ritual effectively reveals emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot maintains tight cause-effect through the short-circuit crisis and hospital countdown. The dual timelines converge efficiently. Some compression of Tanner's technical process feels rushed but doesn't break coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Radio wave garden and water tower establish intriguing atmosphere but lack physical specificity - smells of rust, textures of cables, or sonic details could enhance immersion. The "electromagnetic energy" crackle is evocative but isolated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Ending's emotional resonance elevated by symbolic parallels between mapping railways and preserving memory. Dialogue minimalism works well except the phone confession which verges on sentimentality. Subtext about avoiding hospital confrontation through obsessive work is subtle and powerful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains slightly shopworn emotional beats ("final beep," "weathered face"). The hairbrush numerology and radio-mapping innovation feel fresh. Slight overreliance on "forty-three strokes/years" symmetry feels calculated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements function cohesively within tight constraints - the radio garden and hardware directly enable plot progression. The bittersweet tonal balance maintains clarity despite brevity. Leaves lingering questions about the cost of archival obsession versus present human connection.</comment>
