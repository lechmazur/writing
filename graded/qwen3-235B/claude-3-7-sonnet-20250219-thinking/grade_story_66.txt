<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited exploration of desertion's psychological impact; motivation is implied rather than demonstrated through action. Internal conflict lacks sufficient depth to create a fully-fleshed character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vague causality between mask reconstruction and Theo's disappearance weakens the arc; pivotal actions (carbonization) lack preparatory narrative groundwork. Pacing uneven between atmospheric setup and abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vegetal setting provides fertile atmosphere with electrical surges and responsive plant life. Timeframe markers through puzzles remain underdeveloped; symbolic mirror and kiln imagery partially compensate for inconsistent temporal cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sucessfully weaves metaphor of fragmented identity through physical brokenness. The merging of biological and spiritual communication offers thematic resonance. Verbal expression dominates over sensory immersion in key emotional moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of scientific and mythological elements avoids genre tropes. Nuanced handling of liminality and ecological consciousness elevates originality. Maintains consistent tone without succumbing to ornate embellishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively despite tight word constraints. Timeframe integration feels perfunctory; botanical setting and mask motif work organically. Leaves a lingering contemplation about human/plant symbiosis but sacrifices narrative completeness.</comment>
