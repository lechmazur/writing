<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is conceptually clear but lacks internal complexity. Motivation is consistent but thinly developed. Subtle rebellion shown but emotional dimensionality absent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but overly compressed. Narrative beats (resistance, confrontation, resolution) occur without sufficient emotional or contextual weight. Pacing feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively implied through cosmic imagery but lacks visceral sensory immersion. The setting’s duality (science/lore) is thematic but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of zipper, nebulae, and silence. Subtext about authority vs. intuition resonates. Ending provides emotional resonance. Dialogue sparse but thematically loaded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in merging folklore/quantum metaphors. Avoids overt clichés. Some phrasing risks melodrama but generally restrained. Character logic coherent but not deeply nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but unevenly. The story’s brevity serves its focused theme but limits depth. Memorable core idea with lingering philosophical implications.</comment>
