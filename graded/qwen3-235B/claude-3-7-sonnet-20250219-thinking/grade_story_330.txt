<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character is archetypal with clear motivation, but lacks psychological depth or subtexted complexity; reactions to the trident feel perfunctory rather than emotionally nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within constraints, but the resolution feels slightly rushed; cause-effect between forgotten paths and climax lacks full thematic payoff despite elegant structural symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in zero-gravity environment; atmosphere masterfully enhances mood and theme through details like "constellations of flesh" but occasionally threatens to overwhelm narrative substance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and cyclical structure create strong emotional resonance; dialogue remains purposeful; ending achieves thematic closure while retaining transcendental ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with specific details, but contains fragments of cliched phrasing ("whispers of centuries") and overly ornamental prose that slightly undermines originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative purpose rather than feeling contrived; creates lingering metaphysical questions through integrated symbolism; occasional stylistic excess doesn't obscure thematic unity.</comment>
