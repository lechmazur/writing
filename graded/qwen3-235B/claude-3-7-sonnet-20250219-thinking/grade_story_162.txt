<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Marco’s gambler persona contrasts with his gravitas, but his “uniquely trustworthy” trait lacks nuance. His actions drive the plot, but motivations tied to the past feel underexplored beyond nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves logically through memory and action, but the tight word limit leaves the arc feeling compressed. The blueprint’s role is clear, but stakes lack escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich workshop atmosphere (solder smell, unwatched tapes) immerses readers. The island memory motif and “hammered repose” tone enhance mood, though timeframe connections are loose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of redemption and ethical responsibility resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on reflective narration over active showing. Dialogue and subtext hint at depth but feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on “secret blueprint” tropes without subverting them. Language is purposeful but occasionally florid (“shorelines viewed from above”); emotional beats feel earnest but not revelatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the workshop and blueprint are functional but not indispensable; swapping settings or objects wouldn’t drastically alter the story. The theme resonates but execution lacks cohesion at points.</comment>
