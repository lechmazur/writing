<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eliza’s motivation is clear, and her cynically gentle demeanor explains her underestimation by others, but lacks deeper personal stakes or emotional complexity beyond functional ties to her role. Actions align with traits, but emotional depth feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; moon-phase logic drives the narrative effectively, though the time machine’s mechanics and Thornfield’s defeat feel under-justified within constraints. Pacing maintains momentum but lacks nuanced build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends rustic bakery elements with eerie mysticism, but the emergency time machine in a basement strains immersion. Sensory details anchor setting, yet tonal shifts between mundane and magical occasionally clash.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (power as dough) and imagery (shadows, lunar charts) add depth. Ending resonates thematically, though some emotional beats rely on narration rather than “showing.” The central conflict is crisp but under-layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ideas like moongazing bans and fungal spores subvert tropes, but Thornfield’s tyranny and shadow-guided time travel lean on familiar fantasy frameworks. Language avoids excess but occasionally favors efficiency over poetic freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong despite tight constraints; elements serve the plot, though the time machine’s integration feels contrived. The ending’s thematic closure satisfies, but lingering questions about the setting’s broader logic remain unexplored.</comment>
