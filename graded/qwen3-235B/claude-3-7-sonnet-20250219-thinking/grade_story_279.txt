<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth; obsession feels more like narrative device than organic trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows coherent arc but feels compressed; transitions between backstory and present occasionally jarred by word count constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (sparkling dust, leather-bound spine) masterfully craft atmosphere; however, surreal elements strain internal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (paperclip as baton) and thematic resonance between human obsession and natural order impress; emotionally resonant without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes via blending of science and myth, though some descriptors ("electric peace") verge on abstract vagueness; maintains consistent voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of fantastical and scientific elements works unusually well; brevity enhances mythic quality but limits narrative resolution.</comment>
