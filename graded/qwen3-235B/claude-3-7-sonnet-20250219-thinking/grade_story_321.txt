<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct with clear motivations; Marcos' sacrifice to fix his mistake through memory-root and the hourglass is compelling, though their emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level with limited exploration of internal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured around the hourglass and ribbon as catalysts for time manipulation, with clear beginning/middle/end. Pacing manages the tight word limit well, though the transition to time displacement relies on unexplained supernatural logic that slightly weakens coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting immerses readers in a vividly original infernal kitchen with sensory details (brimstone, despair-scent, simmering souls) that amplify themes of regret. The dreamlike hourglass contrasts effectively with the oppressive environment, though "space where an apology waits unspoken" lacks full integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (ribbon, hourglass) and emotional stakes (forgiveness vs. memory) resonate, but dialogue feels slightly artificial in its poetic precision. The ending’s bittersweet cost of sacrifice is poignant yet undercut by underdeveloped subtext about cosmic consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with its infernal time-travel premise and sparse, evocative metaphors. Minimal purple prose, but the hourglass's mechanics feel semi-formulaic, and emotional beats occasionally lean on abstract concepts ("abrasive calm") rather than nuanced human reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a self-contained narrative with clear thematic throughlines. The brevity amplifies tension rather than limiting scope, though the resolution’s lingering ambiguity (Marcos’ isolation) risks feeling slightly contrived rather than earned.</comment>
