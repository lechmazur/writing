<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's seasickness and familial ties provide motivation but "awkward charm" remains superficial. Internal conflict hinted but lacks dimensional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence and moon-phase-driven progression work, but condensed structure leaves some transitions feeling abrupt despite logical cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (refracted light, ethereal orchid) effectively immerse. Crystal fortress imagery resonates but slightly overshadowed by underdeveloped temporal elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism (mirror as truth/family legacy) and resonant themes (release over answers) elevate. Subtext of inherited trauma and cyclical fate shows craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with ghost orchid's unique role but dips into familiar "truth-revealing mirror" tropes. Prose balanced—lyrical yet purposeful without excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements tightly interwoven (orchid/mirror connection) with deliberate pacing. Concludes with thematic depth but slight structural compression prevents perfection.</comment>
