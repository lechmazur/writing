<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maxwell's swindler persona is vividly established but lacks nuanced internal conflict – his sudden truth-revealing feels undermotivated. Eleanor's skepticism is believable but thinly sketched. Voice distinctions between characters are clear but not deeply developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot pivots logically on the dropped book and ghostly interventions, but the compressed arc feels slightly compressed. The transition from isolated scheming to truth-seeking lacks gradual tension modulation. Computer restart device works but strains coincidence slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush sensory details merge ecological decay and rebirth effectively – shattered windows, soil-concrete interface, rustling orchard sounds. Atmosphere perfectly mirrors thematic tension between truth and concealment. Only minor issue: underutilized skyscraper verticality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (price tags as transactional morality, ghost-debris communication) elevate narrative. Subtext about corporate erasure of human stories resonates strongly. Dialogue is purposeful, ending evokes layered questions about truth's ecology. Emotional beats feel earned rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids genre traps. Ghosts as data-preservation entities is inventive. No artificial phrasing or emotional shortcuts evident. Some descriptions (e.g., "feral-yet-tired") slightly veer toward stylistic risk-taking rather than organic necessity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole that lingers intellectually. Every assigned component serves narrative architecture – particularly strong fusion of setting and core concept. Brevity feels intentional rather than restrictive.</comment>
