<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Malik's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; his actions align with his role but introspection is minimal, relying on surface traits rather than nuanced inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is logical with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing feels rushed during key moments (e.g., brittle branch scene) and cause/effect connections could be smoother.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details ground the dwarven setting, but the surface forest’s thematic connection is underdeveloped, weakening its atmospheric impact on the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (butterfly, reversed messages) and resonant theme; resolution feels overly tidy, reducing tension, but the central idea of unity is powerfully conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; the stained glass butterfly is inventive. Minor issues with overly ornate phrasing ("joyful terror") and predictable emotional beats slightly diminish originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Incorporates assigned elements effectively, though some (e.g., brittle branch) feel tacked on. The story’s brevity enhances focus but leaves subplots underexplored; lingering theme of reconciliation adds depth.</comment>
