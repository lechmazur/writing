<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character exhibits internal conflict through symbolic objects, but lacks emotional depth beyond the central metaphor. Motivation is clear but thinly rendered. Voice remains consistent yet somewhat generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic transformation, but structural transitions feel compressed within the word limit. Coherent arc with implosion as pivot point, though pacing occasionally stalls during atmospheric passages.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Museum setting with fossilized bones evokes layered time and transformation. Sensory details (dust, flute note, bark texture) immerse reader while reinforcing theme. Objects and setting interrelate meaningfully, but dinosaur bones feel slightly underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ring, light/shadow) elevates thematic impact. Ending resonates with paradoxical insight about integration over separation. Subtext on artistic process through tactile descriptions. Tension between control and surrender remains nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original treatment of transformation trope through tactile magic-realism. Avoids clich√©d epiphany through concrete imagery. No formulaic phrases detected, but certain metaphors ("flickering inspiration") border on familiar. Prose maintains purposeful clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively synthesizes assigned elements around existential theme. Brief length emphasizes pivotal moment rather than limiting. Strong stylistic purpose, though some secondary details (night guard's flute) feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>
