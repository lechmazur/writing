<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weak emotional stakes; character’s philosophical pragmatism feels intellectually explained rather than organically demonstrated through action. Motivation for saving farming methods lacks visceral urgency despite thematic importance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on high-stakes gamble paying off, but the fire interruption feels contrived rather than meaningfully integrated. Ending achieves resonance but lacks tension in how victory is attained—too reliant on "luck" as narrative shortcut.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Space pirate setting juxtaposed with medieval tapestry offers intriguing contrasts, but atmosphere remains superficial—misses opportunities to connect "sacred disorder" with environmental details (e.g., how does this hybrid world smell/sound?).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism of tapestry as living agricultural text is impactful; ending image of stars as seeds offers poetic closure. However, emotional weight often relies on declarative statements ("sacred mission") rather than subtextual buildup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends cyberpunk gambling with agrarian mysticism uniquely, but telekinesis/dice mechanics feel like familiar fantasy tropes awkwardly grafted to sci-fi. "Caretakers of wisdom" line risks reducing complexity to didactic moralizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack narrative alchemy—the tapestry’s technical revelations and philosophical themes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt through character decisions or worldbuilding.</comment>
