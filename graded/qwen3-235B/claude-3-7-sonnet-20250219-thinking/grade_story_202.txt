<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's "innocently guilty" duality and code of instinct are stated but underdeveloped. Motivation to target corrupt collectors lacks psychological depth beyond surface-level vigilantism. Actions align with assigned traits but fail to reveal nuanced inner conflict or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt method drives plot coherently but feels rushed in execution. Cryptic clues lack specific connection to museum artifacts. Beginning/end connection works but resolution feels abrupt rather than earned. Logical progression present but lacks narrative escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Found object museum setting provides atmospheric potential but remains underutilized - objects lack historical resonance. Skateboarding festival contrasts with museum's quiet but doesn't integrate meaningfully. "Dusty starlight" motif is poetic but under-developed. Sensory details present but selective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor of skateboarders mirroring Mira's defiance offers thematic layering. Writing style demonstrates polish but avoids risk-taking. Central conflict executes professionally but lacks gut-punch emotional impact. Theme of alternative justice communicates clearly though predictably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in premise but falls into vigilante narrative conventions. Similes (boards "defy physics") verge on generic. Character motivation remains logically consistent but lacks irrational human elements. Language remains precise without excessive flourishes but doesn't push stylistic boundaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated. Skateboarding framing device and rapier weapon feel more functional than inspired. Found object museum could better reflect Mira's psyche. Concise construction prioritizes plot mechanics over deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
