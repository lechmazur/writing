<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nervousness as fretful archer is shown through physical actions but lacks interior depth; motivation tied to grandmother's wisdom is clear but underexplored. "Hesitantly bold" attribute shapes key actions but occasionally feels imposed rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Recipe-driven incantation creates strong narrative momentum. Pacing manages to balance visionary spectacle and character transformation within constraints, though the final resolution feels slightly compressed. Fading hieroglyphs provide effective narrative throughline despite compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative Egyptian details like torchlight, limestone, and charcoal create immersive materiality. Timeframe misalignment (painting vs. photograph) creates minor dissonance, but atmospheric elements like shimmering walls and ancient murals effectively support mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visions as "subtitles from channels of knowledge" offer striking metaphorical resonance. Ending thematic declaration risks didacticism but gains power through character-specific authenticity. Interplay between personal revelation and cosmic perspective achieves emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rarely falls into purple prose but occasionally overreaches with similes ("competing whispers").

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion: recipe becomes bridge between mortal/ divine, fading walls mirror temporal impermanence. Subtle interplay between archer's weapon and scribe's tools reveals character transformation. Final line echoes opening unease with profound resolution.</comment>
