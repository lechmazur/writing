<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; internal conflict hinted through symbols rather than demonstrated actions. The transformation lacks psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a linear arc but feels rushed in key moments (e.g., rebellion initiation). Cause-effect connections are logical but under-explained within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eloquent setting details (lunar greenhouse, biometric locks) effectively ground the atmosphere. Sensory elements and cultural contrasts (Earth vs. lunar) enrich the tone, though some descriptions border on ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-driven storytelling (e.g., "sanctuary" replacing photograph) and layered themes of rebirth resonate. Dialogue is minimal yet impactful. The endingâ€™s symbolic weight carries emotional resonance but lacks nuanced character reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic phrasing. The rebellion narrative employs fresh details (lunar fungi, overheard fragments) to subvert genre tropes, but character reasoning occasionally leans on schematic logic without sufficient emotional texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>While cohesive in concept, the execution struggles to maintain narrative momentum across assigned elements. Themes resonate, but some components feel modular rather than organically integrated.</comment>
