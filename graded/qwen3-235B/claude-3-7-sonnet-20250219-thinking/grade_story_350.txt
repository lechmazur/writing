<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Demetri's expertise as a puppeteer drives his realization but lacks emotional complexity; motivation tied to grandfather's legacy is clear but underexplored beyond surface duty.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows riddle → discovery → revelation arc cleanly, but the revelation-to-resolution progression feels rushed; constellation pattern and stamp symphony connections strain credulity slightly within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie torchlight, crumbling stamps, and tactile puppet strings create immersive mythic atmosphere; wedding gown's symbolic weight and Athena offering deepen spiritual stakes through physical objects.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unique stamp/gown code mechanism but contains occasionally ornate descriptions ("whispered at a puzzle event") and emotionally simplistic moments that suggest formulaic undercurrents beneath inventive core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eleven meticulously linked elements create thematic cohesion; the puppeteer's transformation feels inevitable yet slightly constrained by compressed pacing that occasionally sacrifices nuance for symbolic efficiency.</comment>
