<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Envoy’s motivation for embracing revolutionary ideas feels underdeveloped despite his "skeptical" persona; his transformation hinges on convenience rather than psychological nuance. The character’s "sneer" becomes a repetitive tic rather than a fully integrated trait, and his "voice" is mostly passive until the final act.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear discovery arc, but pacing sags under excessive descriptive detours (e.g., moons, foliage). Sudden shift from "skeptical envoy" to "unlikely savior" lacks intermediate stakes or obstacles. The "paper trail" structure works conceptually but executes through implausible ease of clue-finding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alien vineyard setting achieves atmospheric cohesion through vivid sensory contrasts (e.g., "prismatic patterns," "humming vegetation"). However, the "barren alien plain" remains underexploited—how does Earth’s botany interact with the hostile world beyond the dome? The glowing spores add thematic resonance but feel tacked on narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cup starlight" and "constellation of possibilities" elevate the prose, but emotional engagement is diluted by over-reliance on abstract declarations ("wonder," "destiny"). The ending gestures toward transcendence but fails to anchor the envoy’s change in visceral, memorable detail.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright tropes but leans on familiar sci-fi motifs: alien spores tracking movements, the "chosen skeptic" protagonist, and moonlit prismatic patterns border on cliché. Some phrases ("rambling destiny," "whispered secrets") feel overly poetic rather than organically earned. The "furiously tranquil" juxtaposition lacks contextual depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres conceptually but struggles with tonal elasticity—melding bureaucratic politics with mystical spores creates friction rather than synergy. The brevity sacrifices character interiority and worldbuilding logic, though the central metaphor of harnessing alien energy through "paper" remains intriguingly paradoxical.</comment>
