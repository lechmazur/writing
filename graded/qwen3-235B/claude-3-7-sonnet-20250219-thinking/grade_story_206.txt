<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Riven with clear motivations tied to a vendetta and lost memory, but internal conflict lacks layered exploration; emotional shifts are stated rather than enacted.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect progression, but rushed final act; thematic cohesion between Lyria’s discovery and rebellion’s victory feels superficially resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Evocative details (sugar sculptures, confiscated photos) ground the world, but political systems and sensory immersion remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original method (candy-as-cipher) elevates genre tropes, but anonymous photo delivery lacks organic integration; avoids overt clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but constrained by brevity; lingering themes of erased memory are compelling, yet psychological complexity is sacrificed.</comment>
