<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lin's quiet nature and trauma are consistent motivators, but his internal emotional arc remains somewhat abstract; while his gardening symbolizes nurturing fragmented self, emotional depth lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story traces a coherent arc from silence to emotional synthesis, but pacing issues arise—Sophia's role in recovery feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit, weakening cause-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory details (bird calls, tea) immerse readers, but the "universal translation center" remains a superficially sketched setting; its potential as a metaphor for emotional/linguistic divides isn't fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The purse-as-algorithm symbol and silence-as-communication metaphors resonate emotionally, though the ending's sentimental undertones slightly undercut its subtlety; theme of emotion-language duality is compellingly sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but employs familiar tropes (silent retreat, memory-trigger objects) without significant subversion; prose occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction that edges toward "purple prose" but stops short.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements cohesively into a thematic whole, though some (e.g., "regularly random") feel forced; despite word constraints, the story achieves conceptual resonance over technical polish.</comment>
