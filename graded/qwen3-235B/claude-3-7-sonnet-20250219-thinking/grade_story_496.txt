<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's repression and doubts anchor the narrative, but transformation feels rushed and underexplored, reducing the emotional impact of his newfound power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot’s core action (using the bottle) drives the story, but the ambush feels undermotivated and the resolution occurs too abruptly within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic setting is atmospheric and thematically resonant but occasionally overwhelms the narrative with excess description, diluting focus on character and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic language and metaphors (e.g., "poetry on mortal skin") elevate the story, but the ending leans on conceptual symbolism rather than fully immersive emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in merging cosmic horror with artistic struggle is undercut by occasional purple prose and a reliance on mystical chosen-one tropes that feel overly familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story feels structurally cohesive but uneven—elements like the ambush and cosmic transformation strain believability, and thematic depth is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
