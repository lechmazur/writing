<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Clear motivation (exposing historical truth) consistently drives actions. Weakness: Character complexity sacrificed to brevity; "dutiful scholar" archetype lacks distinct personal history or vulnerabilities beyond her ideological commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Single tight action (broadcasting the testimony) creates clear arc within constraints. Weakness: Consequences implied but underdeveloped. Resolution feels abrupt despite word limit; tension between immediate stakes and condensed timeframe could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Sterile capsule hotel contrasts with emotional weight of forbidden history. Weakness: Sensory details minimal; "earthbound flight" atmosphere described through abstraction rather than visceral sensory language that might enhance the sterile/corrupted setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Memorable metaphors ("seeds" of truth, sanitized history), thematic weight, emotionally resonant ending. Weakness: Occasional didacticism ("precious: truth") undercuts show-don't-tell aspirations. Subtext about institutional control well-handled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strengths: Avoids overt clich√©s; time travel premise reimagined through censorship rather than divergence. Weakness: Some generic descriptors ("dangerous intention," "carefully maintained historical narrative"); could benefit from more idiosyncratic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Cohesive use of elements to explore truth vs. institutional control. Lingering thematic question about historical manipulation. Weakness: Concision occasionally undermines emotional impact (e.g., Lin's sacrifice feels underexplored).</comment>
