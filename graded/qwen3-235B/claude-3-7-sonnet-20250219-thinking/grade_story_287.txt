<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent internal conflict exploration; motivations are clear but lack layered psychological nuance. The "torn visionary" trait remains underexplored beyond superficial juxtaposition of science/mysticism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is generally logical but feels rushed in key revelation scenes; the device-Almanac alignment lacks sufficient narrative buildup despite strong framing devices.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in catacombs; sometimes borders on Gothic clich√©. Illuminated manuscript/eclipsing stars concept effectively supports mystical-scientific duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphor usage ("stars forgetting to dance"); thematically coherent with emotional beats shown through actions rather than stated. Thematic unity strong despite occasionally didactic ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements successfully integrated into cohesive whole; predictable redemption-of-forgotten-wisdom arc elevated by effective stylistic execution within artificial constraints.</comment>
