<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sufficiently consistent but lacks nuanced evolution; transformation from self-doubt to authority feels underexplored despite clear central motivation</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arc compression works but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect logic tightens with fog as pivotal device but pacing slightly uneven</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate (fog as shared memory) but occasionally overwritten ("fire that consumed Earth"); ending achieves thematic resonance though dialogue bordering on exposition</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mix of fresh combinations (mage-scientist tension) and predictable beats; emotional beats primarily shown but occasional telegraphing; magic system lacks distinctiveness</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements synergize tightly; brevity enhances urgency; metaphoric richness invites lingering contemplation of legacy and rebirth</comment>
