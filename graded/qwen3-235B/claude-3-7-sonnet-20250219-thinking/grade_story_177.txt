<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Motivation to restore lost art is clear, rebellion hinted but underexplored. Weaknesses: Marielle's inner psychological depth remains vague; her connection to the giant feels plot-convenient rather than earned through character history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Clear cause-effect through mask's resonance triggering events; tight arc compresses meaningful progression. Weaknesses: Revolution subplot introduced too late for full integration; spatial transitions between book sections occasionally strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Sensory-rich with crackling bookshelves, organ vibrations, and visual metaphors for systemic control. Weaknesses: Giant's physical absence weakens the visceral impact of towering, oppressive scale implied by the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strengths: Imagery of crystallized truth/projection tableaux creates haunting symbolic resonance; theme of self-perception as revolutionary act is profound. Weaknesses: Frenzy-as-tone occasionally dilutes emotional weight of pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strengths: Avoids genre clich√©s through obituary-as-magic concept; metaphors like "rebinding fate" feel fresh. Weaknesses: Descriptions of "whispers" and "humming" occasionally verge on abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strengths: Elements interweave seamlessly (giant's bookshelf as prison and metaphor; mask's transformations mirroring narrative structure). Weaknesses: Revolution framing feels more atmospheric than thematically central.</comment>
