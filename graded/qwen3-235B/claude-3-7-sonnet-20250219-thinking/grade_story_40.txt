<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's reincarnation as a goldfish feels under-explored, with guilt shaping his actions but lacking psychological depth. The toy soldier's symbolism is strong, but the core traits don't fully inform the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-driven encounter structures the plot effectively, but the transformation of tradition feels rushed. The beginning-end connection works but lacks tonal complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Recipe library's atmosphere is vivid (dust, 18th-century tea), but Caribbean cuisine section and sensory details in secondary spaces lack specificity. Timeframe amplifies melancholy but underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of brokenness and renewal resonate through symbolic objects. The ending's pocketing of the soldier evokes emotional resonance. Dialogue is concise yet meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unique premise with goldfish reincarnation, but some elements (doctor's appointment) feel trope-adjacent. Avoids purple prose but occasionally tells emotions rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically coherent whole, though reincarnation concept feels underexploited. The brevity serves the quiet character arc effectively.</comment>
