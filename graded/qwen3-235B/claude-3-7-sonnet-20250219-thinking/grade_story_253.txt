<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's politeness and duality as student/bandit are distinct, but motivation to master time lacks emotional depth; shattered allegiances mentioned but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot logically structured with cause-effect chain (security activation, injury, confrontation), but abrupt resolution with the professor dilutes tension; pacing works within limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Digital graveyard" imagery and harp-induced disorientation create immersive, tech-noir atmosphere; sensory details like shattered glass and distorted sound enhance mood effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("algorithms blossom") and theme of time mastery resonate, but minimal dialogue and unresolved emotional beats weaken impact; ending raises questions without sufficient payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unique elements like "polite bandit" and harp security system subvert tropes, but phrases like "shattered like dropped hard drives" risk clich√©; concept-driven over emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack thematic density; time manipulation theme drives plot, yet condensed format leaves character and setting potential unfulfilled.</comment>
