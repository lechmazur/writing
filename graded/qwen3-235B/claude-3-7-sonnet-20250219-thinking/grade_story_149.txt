<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Complex character with contradictory traits; motivation is clear but the transformation feels slightly rushed. Internal conflict is well-embodied through tactile interactions with objects, but deeper emotional nuance could strengthen the arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compelling setup and resolution with cosmic revelation, but the middle pacing – particularly the transition to the laundromat encounter and its aftermath – feels compressed. Logical cause-and-effect exists but requires tighter narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, cohesive atmosphere where oversized items metaphorically mirror metaphysical concepts. Sensory details (humming dryers, trembling desk) enhance mood. The giant's study becomes an extension of cosmic interconnectedness, though some visual specifics verge on excessive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Provocative metaphor usage ("spaces between thoughts") and layered theme of unity vs. dissolution elevate the story. The ending's philosophical twist resonates emotionally and intellectually. Subtle showing through objects (e.g., flower's physical state mirroring Marcus's burden) is masterful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through surreal scale and tactile metaphors. Some descriptions ("haunting delight") recur slightly formulaically, but the unique twist on "visionary conduit" clichés (especially the soul/unification ambiguity) demonstrates ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense conceptual load; almost every element serves the central theme. The brief format amplifies tension through controlled ambiguity rather than limitation. Lingers through paradoxical idea of connection through dissolution.</comment>
