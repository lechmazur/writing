<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear (preservation/pursuit of ancient wisdom) but underdeveloped; her backstory and emotional layers beyond “grudging admiration” remain superficial. The quilt’s connection to her great-grandmother adds potential depth but is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent, with a clear arc from clandestine experiment to revelation. Some transitions (e.g., spores activating synthetic cells) strain plausibility within the tight word count, but the cyclical return to the quilt’s “secrets” provides a satisfying framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The misted greenhouse with faux flora and the lullaby’s silence create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (glimmering spores, artificial light) enhance the eerie, anachronistic tension between preservation and rebirth. Timeframe and setting synergize effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through the metaphor of the quilt as “biological memory” and subtext about preservation vs. evolution. The ending’s ambiguity (“blasphemy against nature”) invites reflection but lacks deeper philosophical nuance. Prose is vivid but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar “resurrecting lost wisdom” tropes. Some phrases (“harbor for wisdom,” “flow of chlorophyll”) border on overwrought, and the quilt’s sentience feels abrupt rather than subversive. Emotional reactions are shown through action but lack visceral human complexity.</comment>
