<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lack of interiority undermines motivation; actions align with traits but emotional grounding feels thin. Assigned attribute only superficially explored through rote rituals, not integrated into deeper character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Piano method drives plot but requires contrived leaps; circular structure satisfying yet compressed arc feels schematic. Pacing hesitates between poetic interludes and narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stark visual motifs (glass, monarch) create haunting atmosphere but sensory details remain surface-level; setting evokes mood but underutilizes its symbolic potential to deepen themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ending's mystical resonance undercut by underdeveloped conflict; symbols (fork, piano) gain emotional weight through echoes-yet-transformed metaphor, but thematic payoff remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through surreal science-theology fusion; piano's harmonic code feels fresh despite faint whiff of "chosen one" trope. Language occasionally overadorned but generally restrained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Exquisite fragments never fully cohere; elements serve poetic logic over narrative urgency. Lingering resonance comes from imagery rather than character truth or conceptual breakthroughs.</comment>
