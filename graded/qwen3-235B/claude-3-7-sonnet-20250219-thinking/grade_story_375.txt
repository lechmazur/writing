<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (rejection of Council's lies) is clear but lacks depth in emotional evolution; actions align with traits but inner conflict remains underexplored; dialogue shows character's obsession rather than distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action (sabotage as alignment with the star) drives the plot effectively, though time compression makes pivotal moments feel abrupt; conceptual connection between imperfection and stellar magic provides closure despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering (e.g., "weathered cables," "mannequins' silence") creates a hauntingly cohesive atmosphere; setting’s precariousness mirrors thematic focus on imperfection’s beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong craftsmanship: stellar magic as metaphor for marginalized truths; ending resolves inner and outer conflicts with transformative poeticism; dialogue-like inner voices effectively humanize the surreal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original combinations (sentient mannequins guiding sabotage) avoid clichés; avoids ornate excess; some sensory details (fog, cracked porcelain) feel slightly generic but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements unify to interrogate perfectionism; brevity enhances focus on transformation arc; leaves rich subtext about reclaiming discarded beauty.</comment>
