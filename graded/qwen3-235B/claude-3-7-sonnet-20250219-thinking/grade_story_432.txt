<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marek's death wish and immunity create visceral irony, but his motivation becomes clear only near the end. The transformation from self-destructive to purposeful is well-executed. However, the initial establishment of his internal conflict feels slightly rushed within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite pacing despite length; from poison tasting to ice collapse, cause-effect is logical. The tight link between Marek's pattern recognition and the climax (map revelation) creates cohesion. Only minor stumbles in indicating how Elder Vira's exposition ties to the urgent collapse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Sensory mastery: the roaring waterfall against fragile ice, bitter almonds, glowing bookmark, and prismatic light create a tactile, mystical atmosphere. Subterranean setting and charged air enhance both tone and plot mechanics, seamlessly embedding strangeness into the world's fabric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The revelation that consciousness—not earth energy—is the true map lingers powerfully. Symbolism (bookmarks binding souls, ice as transformation) avoids being overt. Marek's epiphany emerges organically through action, not explanation, culminating in a transcendent yet grounded ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The talk-radio method feels audacious yet plausible within the world, avoiding trope repetition. Some phrasing ("serene upheaval," "storm clouds gather without fear") borders on cliché but works due to thematic resonance. Emotional beats are shown through gestures (bookmark-clutching) rather than stated, avoiding AI-like flatness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively: the short form highlights tension rather than limiting. Every component (from immunity to ice collapse) serves thematic or structural purpose. The closing image of pulsing ice fragments implies infinite narrative possibilities beyond the text, inviting reflection.</comment>
