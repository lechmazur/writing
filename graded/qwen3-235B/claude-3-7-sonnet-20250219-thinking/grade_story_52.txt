<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are mostly consistent but feel slightly rushed in development; Felix’s guilt and devotion drive actions effectively, but emotional nuance could deepen through more introspective moments rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly cohesive despite word constraints, but the karaoke duet’s emotional revelation feels abrupt; pacing balances progression and brevity, though some transitions lack subtle buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Richly evocative worldbuilding (hourglass, fading chalk) anchors the atmosphere, but overreliance on metaphors (e.g., "blithe discontent") occasionally dilutes sensory immersion; setting enhances tone without overshadowing story.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (sharpener as guilt, hourglass as impermanence) and subtext (devotion vs. secrecy) creates lingering emotional resonance; dialogue and staging feel purposeful, though some lyrical passages risk overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the hourglass concept and duet framework, but occasional ornate phrasing ("tastefully offensive lyrics") and predictable redemption arcs suggest formulaic tendencies; emotional beats lean on tropes rather than raw nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements without feeling forced; the concise format serves the narrative’s intimacy but sacrifices deeper character exploration; thematic echoes (secrets, impermanence) linger, if unevenly realized.</comment>
