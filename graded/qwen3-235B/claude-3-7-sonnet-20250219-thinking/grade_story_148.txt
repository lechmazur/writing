<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's inner conflict is clear but underexplored; trauma from past failure feels surface-level. Her storm-chasing expertise ties logically to carousel mechanics, but emotional depth lacks nuanced showing of transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on improbable tapestry-decoding logic; transitions between mechanical failures and solutions feel rushed. Resolution ties cleanly to theme but skips necessary technical/emotional steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, contrasting sensory details (desert past vs alpine present) create immersive atmosphere. Tapestries and workshop artifacts ground the setting, though meteorological codes in threads strain plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (carousel as resurrection/forecasting device) and "showing" through solar panel integration. Theme of redemption through creation resonates, but emotional beats occasionally default to statement over subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with unique fusion of meteorology/machinist codes. Sensory details remain specific (chipped manes, weathered faces). Some contrived parallels (tapestry codes) but overall maintains distinct voice and purposeful style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion achieved despite dense elemental load. Solar panels/weather instruments demonstrate clever dual-purpose integration. Leaves thematic resonance but lacks lingering ambiguity—ends too neatly.</comment>
