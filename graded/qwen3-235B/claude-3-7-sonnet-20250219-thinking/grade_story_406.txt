<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While motivations are clear and consistent, internal conflicts remain underexplored. Mutual respect with Vorna feels earned but lacks the psychological depth needed for full character transcendence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight structure with satisfying circularity (button/amulet), but pacing strains in transitions between introspection and action. Time-reversal resolution feels rushed despite emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Evocative witch-brewery details ground the reader, but the blend of espionage and sorcery lacks fully realized sensory contrasts. Morning paper motif hints at mundanity vs. magic without maximizing potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Packs thematic heft (redemption, vulnerability) with elegant symbolism. Ending resonates conceptually but could push further in showing transformed character behavior post-resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps with fresh metaphors and controlled prose, but Vorna's prescience borders on contrivance. Subtly layered emotions undercut occasionally formulaic rivalry-to-respect arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Competing forces of urgency and reflection clash briefly, but thematic unity and clever element integration justify its length. Lingering questions about "borrowed valor" remain underdeveloped but not fatal.</comment>
