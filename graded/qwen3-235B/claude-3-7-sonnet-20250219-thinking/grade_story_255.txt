<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's analytical innovation and innocent cynicism provide some depth, but motivation for 'delayed justice' relies on underdeveloped backstory. Reaction to petrichor reveals sensory-driven method but lacks human nuance in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from activation via scent to data decryption, but reliance on mystical scent trigger creates logical gaps. Ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance; pacing uneven during decryption sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned control tower with technological decay juxtaposes with natural petrichor to create haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (confetti, console textures, rain sounds) masterfully intertwine with thematic elements of buried truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Petrichor as symbolic trigger and metaphor for truth resurfacing provides thematic cohesion. 'Mythic relic as data' concept innovatively modern, but emotional impact weakened by sparse character interiority and reliance on expository visions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Avoids most trope pitfalls by merging technology with mysticism, but 'innocent cynicism' remains underexplored. Some purple prose ('technological snow'), yet petrichor integration and relic-as-data subvert expectations effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine creatively without feeling forced. Timeframe creates narrative urgency, though story length leaves thematic resonance partially unexamined. Lingering question of truth's temporal power lingers appropriately.</comment>
