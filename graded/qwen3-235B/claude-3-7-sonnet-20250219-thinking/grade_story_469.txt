<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (reunion/legacy) but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits yet internal conflicts remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elevated tension via countdown pacing works well, but the discovery of the hidden door feels rushed; the arc is complete but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (jasmine, stone, echoes) create vivid immersion; setting actively shapes the narrative and character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphor and imagery elevate emotional resonance; ending balances hope and ambiguity but slightly overexplains its themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans into ornate phrasing; emotional subtext is nuanced but some devices (countdown urgency) feel conventionally executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole; brevity enhances urgency but sacrifices deeper character/societal exploration.</comment>
