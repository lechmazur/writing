<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is logically structured and thematic progression clear, but crucial emotional stakes feel compressed; pacing occasionally rushed in key transition moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Steampunk mechanics and celestial imagery create immersive atmosphere; sensory details like whirring gears and shifting ink enhance mood but emotional resonance of physical setting could be stronger.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Creative fusion of Western/outlaw elements with cosmic mythology avoids genre tropes; occasional ornate phrasing ("saturated ambivalence") risks stylistic excess but overall maintains consistent tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively despite brevity; each component serves overarching theme; conclusion resonates intellectually if not entirely emotionally within constrained word count.</comment>
