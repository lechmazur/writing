<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's selective mutism and ventriloquism are conceptually integrated but lack psychological depth; her optimism feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced choices or internal conflict. Wavelength's dialogue occasionally strains plausibility for a mute character's chosen voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on condensed time progression ("night after night") that flattens stakes. The diner-to-hologram transition feels rushed, weakening the emotional impact of interdimensional collaboration. Concept drives structure but narrows character exploration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Parallel universe beach described in superficially vivid terms ("violet sea") but never meaningfully interacts with the diner setting or protagonist's work. Sensory details privilege visual elements while neglecting sonic (critical for a silent protagonist) and tactile possibilities to deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Euphoria of connection is palpable, but the theme of cross-dimensional family lacks tension—resolution feels predetermined rather than earned. Metaphor of weather as communication bridges worlds effectively, though dialogue occasionally succumbs to inspirational platitude over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise combines familiar elements in novel ways but occasionally relies on genre shortcuts—interdimensional communication via coffee sleeve stretches credulity without explanation. Emotional beats lean on "found family" templates rather than subverting them, though the mute ventriloquist concept offers fresh narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves structural completeness but feels constrained by word limit—character relationships and scientific mechanics warrant deeper exploration. Emotional resonance and inventive premise suggest potential beyond current execution, with recurring motifs (cardboard sleeve, two moons) creating lingering impact despite rushed pacing.</comment>
