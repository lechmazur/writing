<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly portrayed with symbolic actions, but lacks emotional depth beyond archetypal role as truth-revealer. Motivation consistent but insufficiently personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Circular structure (opening/closing with "truth uncaged") is cohesive. Plot moves logically but climax feels slight, needing deeper resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and layered paint create immersive, mythic atmosphere. Timeframe of ending tradition heightens tension within setting's symbolic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (cage/mind, paint/illusion) are vivid and thematically resonant. The ending lingers subtextually but could deepen emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; the sign's hidden history demonstrates creativity. Some phrases ("feral elegance") verge on ornate but purposeful tone is maintained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements intentionally interwoven (setting, object, concept) to amplify tension between truth and comfort. Short format serves thematic brevity effectively.</comment>
