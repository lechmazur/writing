<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's transformation from despair to purpose is abrupt; motivations shift suddenly without thorough emotional groundwork. "Unsteady" trait is demonstrated but not deeply entwined with actions until climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with cause-effect clarity, but backstory compression creates slight narrative whiplash. Revelation-through-letters mechanic drives the plot efficiently despite time-skip gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong visual atmosphere with collapsing stars and brass imagery, but sensory details remain surface-level. Setting evokes cosmic isolation but lacks tactile/auditory depth beyond sight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and paradoxical "cheerless ecstasy" create emotional resonance. Themes of self-determination vs. fate and destruction as rebirth are profound, though ending leans on philosophical weight more than earned emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps with fresh cosmic imagery, but contains faintly overwrought phrases ("ambush of fate"). Subverts "forgotten guardian" trope through time-loop twist, though emotional nuance feels occasionally algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere remarkably well within limited word count; cosmic scale balanced with intimate character arc. Ending's conceptual weight exceeds emotional payoff but leaves lingering philosophical questions about agency.</comment>
