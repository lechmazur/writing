<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character shows defined motivation but traits like "apologetic thug" lack emotional depth; intellectual interests feel occasionally incongruous without deeper exploration of internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but pacing feels compressed, especially in developing Dr. Reeves' character and the transition from staged meetings to her job offer; some plot points resolve too neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Static electricity garden vividly evokes tactile/sensory details; atmosphere reinforces thematic ties to transformation, though connections to broader setting (museums) could be more cohesive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (static as liberation) and subtext about redemption; dialogue understated but meaningful. Some overreliance on thematic "on-the-nose" phrasing ("trajectory," "circuit completed").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique setting and symbolic objects but veers toward predictable redemption tropes. Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic in emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but relies on convenience (e.g., repeated museum encounters). Style enhances clarity but lacks risk-taking beyond familiar literary frameworks of self-reinvention.</comment>
