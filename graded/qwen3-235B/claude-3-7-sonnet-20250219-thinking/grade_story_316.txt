<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent motivation through childhood promise and trauma; character's timid nature shapes methods but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraint; pacing tightens effectively though some transitions between sections feel slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich synesthetic details (fabric textures, typewriter sounds) create immersive atmosphere; temple's layered history deepens thematic resonance of preserved memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic craft (typewriter/loom parallels, stitched book) with emotional undercurrent; ending avoids maudlin resolution but could deepen subtext about institutional erasure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh integration of mythic/spatial repurposing avoids clich√©; precise sensory language (specifically "scattered harmony" through auditory descriptions) prevents abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into meditation on collective memory; lyrical prose elevates theme but slight tonal unevenness in industrial lamp descriptions reduces overall impact.</comment>
