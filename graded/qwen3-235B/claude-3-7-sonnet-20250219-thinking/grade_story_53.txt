<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's grief and scientific background are clear but underdeveloped; emotional transitions feel abrupt. Motivation for seeking solace in cosmic vastness lacks gradual psychological buildup. Reaction to postcards shifts characterization too suddenly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has basic structure (detour → discovery → epiphany) but pacing feels compressed within word limits. Connection between moving day and cosmic revelation is thematic but lacks narrative integration. Concept of postcards drives plot but their origin remains unexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere of howling winds and fortress quiet creates striking sensory contrasts. Setting enhances themes of isolation/mystery but mystical tone occasionally clashes with protagonist's scientific perspective. Specific details (craggy outcroppings, wooden box) ground worldbuilding effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical ending reframes cosmic fear as acceptance. Metaphors about breathing universe and "pocket of perfect stillness" are memorable. "Universally unique" postcards imply layered interconnectedness. Theme of grief processed through cosmic perspective is thought-provoking but slightly on-the-nose in final line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids total formulaicity through cosmic postcard conceit – an original fantastical element. Some standard tropes (mysterious fortress, widow's journey) used but subverted by the epistemic postcards. Emotional resonance balanced between shown details (carrying box reverently) and stated realizations. Language remains purposeful without excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres through atmospheric consistency despite tight format. Elements support central theme of vastness vs. solace. While moving day serves as practical timeframe, its relevance feels tenuous beyond establishing transitional period. Lingering feeling of personal revelation persists, though depth is necessarily limited by brevity.</comment>
