<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weak emotional depth; motivations shift too abruptly from greed to existential acceptance without sufficient psychological layering.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Efficient pacing forced by word count, but the reversal process feels contrived rather than organic; abrupt transition from panic to philosophical resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mundane sensory details (e.g., glass lid, lab benches) lack vibrancy; the juxtaposition of "quantum" and "spiritual" remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sharp irony in mysticism-meets-science premise; flatlining emotional arcs and expository dialogue limit resonance despite clever metaphysical metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through genre-blending but strains credulity with convenient scientific hand-waving; dialogue verges on quippy without devolving into kitsch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but lack nuanced thematic integration; premise outshines underdeveloped character and plot mechanics.</comment>
