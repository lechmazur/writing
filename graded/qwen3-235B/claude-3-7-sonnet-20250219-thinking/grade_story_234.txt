<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's xenophile trait and sword handling shape motivation and actions effectively, though "faithfully unfaithful" remains superficially stated rather than deeply embodied through sustained behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ritual-based plot structure demonstrates cause-effect logic and cyclical coherence, though the ending connection between Hiroshi/curator feels underdeveloped despite promising thematic alignment with "late bloomers."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of moonlit dinosaur bones, tactile sword-polishing, and thermal shifts in the matchbox create immersive atmosphere that emotionally and symbolically amplifies the story's metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vibrant metaphors (e.g. "galaxy in his hand"), understated dialogue, and subtext about cosmic interconnectedness create emotional resonance, though Hiroshi's marital infidelity isn't sufficiently shown to carry thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>While avoiding genre clich√©s, some phrases ("whispered of knowledge not meant for human minds") border on familiar cosmic horror tropes; otherwise demonstrates bold originality in merging swordsmanship, astronomy, and existential longing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of constraints into a thematically rich narrative about finding purpose through unconventional practices, though brevity prevents deeper exploration of certain character dimensions.</comment>
