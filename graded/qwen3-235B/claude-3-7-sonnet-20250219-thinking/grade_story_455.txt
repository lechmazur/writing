<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation for redemption lacks sufficient emotional underpinning despite consistent actions; internal conflicts remain surface-level, showing rather than feeling.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot connects beginning and end with encoded message as catalyst but feels rushed; key transitions (e.g., from present to past) are underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (murmuring water, shadow patterns) effectively establishes mood; atmosphere aligns with inherited mystery but underuses sensory details beyond visuals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (scars as armor) and symbolic objects add depth; central conflict introduced but theme of reckoning feels more hinted than fully explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (e.g., "spectral judgments") but relies on familiar spy tropes; writing style occasionally veers into ornate description, undercutting emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements are tightly integrated but not revolutionary; the story is effective but lacks transcendent originality or lingering philosophical resonance.</comment>
