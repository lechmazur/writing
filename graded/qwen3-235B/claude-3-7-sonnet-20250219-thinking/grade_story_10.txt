<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through nuanced internal conflict or consistent behavioral patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but compressed execution weakens causal momentum; pivotal revelations lack sufficient emotional groundwork despite effective conceptual bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with evocative decay imagery, but deeper integration of setting-specific logic (e.g., quantum leak history) remains underexploited for thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical cohesion (recipes as memory/identity) and symbolic subtext elevate impact; some emotional beats rely on abstraction over visceral embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity in concept but occasionally falters in psychological nuance; certain phrases ("bitter sweet reckoning") verge on familiar abstraction rather than fresh specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity with minor gaps; the marriage of quantum decay and inherited trauma offers compelling conceptual synergy that lingers intellectually.</comment>
