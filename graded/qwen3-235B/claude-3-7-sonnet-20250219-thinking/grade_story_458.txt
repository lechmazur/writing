<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve physical books is clear, but her internal struggle feels rushed. The coat button and spiritual secularism hint at depth but aren't fully explored, though her "no" feels consistent with established priorities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from arrival to decision, but the 400-word limit strains coherence—visitors arriving "already" after the directive feels abrupt. Coffee stain symbolism drives the choice effectively, yet resolution arrives too tidily.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid details: frozen conveyor belts, solar canvas wings, and coffee stains as divination tools. Sensory immersion strengthens the abandoned spaceport setting, though moon colony visitors lack grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elicits contemplation of tradition vs. progress through layered metaphors (infinite grief in coffee stains, brass button as history). Ending's hope feels earned, but the central conflict's stakes could be more visceral to deepen emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés; the flying library concept is inventive. Spiritual secularism and coffee stains as divination feel purposeful, not formulaic. Some phrasing ("weight of ten thousand books") risks being overly ornate but serves atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce tightly around preservation-as-rebellion theme. Short form enhances urgency; the "second" timeframe (7H) sharpens tension. Ending lingers emotionally, though the bridge to unity concept (7C) lacks philosophical complexity.</comment>
