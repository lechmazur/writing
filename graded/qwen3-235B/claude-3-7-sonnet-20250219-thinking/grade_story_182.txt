<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ellis's duality (curiosity/regret) informs his actions; emotional beats are consistent but lack deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing tightens in critical moments but resolution feels abrupt; narrative logic bridges beginning and end but with slight structural slack.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually rich setting; magnetic mountain's properties slightly underutilized despite evocative details like projector's mechanical drone and spoon's tactile warmth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and conceptual irony ("frolicsome regret") elevate the story, but thematic layers remain suggestively rather than fully developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through specific details (mural's chaotic figures, magnetic spoon mechanics) but occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction that risks vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a self-contained mythos; brevity occasionally sacrifices emotional depth but maintains narrative momentum.</comment>
