<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but emotional depth feels underdeveloped; Mira's trickster instincts drive action but inner conflicts lack visceral weight despite competent integration of assigned traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Efficient plot structure uses tight constraints effectively; clear causal chain from encrypted message to decision, though some transitions between thematic elements could be smoother within compressed format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral atmosphere through hydroponic details, artificial lighting, and hermetically sealed tension; biodome setting meaningfully intersects with linguistic preservation theme through biotechnological decay metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through existential stakes; "infinite untraveled paths" metaphor and haunting language around vanishing epistemologies create lingering thematic impact despite slightly overexplanatory ending.</comment>
