<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters have distinct traits but lack depth; motivations are surface-level, with insufficient exploration of how past experiences shape their actions or choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept hybridization (migratory patterns + Morse code) avoids formulaicity, though mechanical elements (steampunk setting) feel derivative rather than subversive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function but lack symbiotic integration; brevity works against full realization of thematic potential despite imaginative premise.</comment>
