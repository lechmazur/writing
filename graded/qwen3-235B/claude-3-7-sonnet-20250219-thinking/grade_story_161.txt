<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eugene's orchardist background effectively informs his observational skills, and his grief-driven motivation remains consistent throughout. However, certain actions (e.g., sudden technical expertise in aerospace conspiracies) feel undermotivated despite his methodicalness. His dialogue exhibits sardonic voice but lacks deeper emotional range.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Precision and momentum maintained through tight causality: son's death → letter seal → peacock demonstration → conspiracy exposure. Some plot elements (engineers accepting feather evidence) could use more justification, but structural coherence is achieved despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility's juxtaposition with agricultural motifs creates intriguing artificial/natural tension. Sensory details (coffee bitterness, fading light) support mood, but corporate espionage elements lack deeper environmental integration beyond symbolic parallels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper airplane symbolism and pruning metaphors elevate thematic resonance. The ending's release of case files through flight achieves emotional payoff. Some thematic consistency weakened by occasionally heavy-handed exposition ("sardonic glee" reiterations).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional avian-based investigation and orchardist protagonist. Language remains purposeful without excess ornamentation. Human-nature-technology parallels feel organically integrated rather than formulaically imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements combine to create a layered whole: agricultural precision fuels scientific inquiry, grief motivates meticulous detective work. Narrative compression occasionally sacrifices secondary character development but maintains thematic integrity and emotional resonance through precise symbolic action.</comment>
