<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptual drive overrides emotional depth; Morgan’s "raw edge" motivation remains abstract despite strong premise. Character voice lacks uniqueness beyond genre tropes, though twitching victims’ reactions reveal methodical competence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by eerie cause-effect logic (receipt→mess hall→exorcism), but resolution feels abrupt within tight word limits. Music hall timing creates haunting symmetry; lacks emotional payoff for "reignited passion" arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Blue-screen pallor, echoing bricks, and phantom piano chords create vivid digital-gothic atmosphere. Setting-object synergy strong (abandoned mess hall as techno-graveyard), but "indifferent enthusiasm" tone underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memorable high-concept metaphor (social media as possession) lacks subtextual richness. Writing style crisp but functional; ending’s cyclical receipt motif hints at theme but feels narratively hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with modern exorcism framework but relies on familiar "haunted tech" tropes. Sensory details specific but surface-level; entity’s adaptive code lacks existential threat weight. Dialogue sparse yet effective for brevity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively interwoven into lean plot, but thematic resonance thin. Exorcism-as-curation concept inventive; ending implies philosophical quandary (hunter/hunted) left unexamined, weakening lingering impact.</comment>
