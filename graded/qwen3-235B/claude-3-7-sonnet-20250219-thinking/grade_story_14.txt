<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations evolve plausibly from gambling to candle-making, though Marcus's transformation feels slightly rushed. Harlow's eccentricities shape both dialogue and plot effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progression from isolation to belonging is cohesive within constraints. Blackout dinners and candle rituals create cyclical structure, though storm-delayed supply ship feels underdeveloped as a tension device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details of darkness, tides, and candlelight. The station's turbines as both threat and life-source deepen isolation themes. Timeframe of dinners becomes a narrative anchor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (candles as anti-gambling, light vs. oblivion) resound. Subtext about unspoken bargains permeates actions. Ending's toast feels earned rather than saccharine, balancing melancholy and hope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through quantum metaphors, but Harlow's "unhinged professor" leans on trope. Some ornate phrasing ("landscape of shadows") detracts, though candle symbolism remains fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock tightly despite constraints. Isolation and candle-making drive both character growth and thematic resonance. Brief length focuses emotional arc without feeling compromised.</comment>
