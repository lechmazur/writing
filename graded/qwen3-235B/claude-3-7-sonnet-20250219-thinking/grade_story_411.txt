<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's synthetic nature informs his paradoxical attraction/repulsion, but motivation for eternal task lacks depth beyond abstract longing. Emotional resonance through fragmented confessions reveals depth, yet voice occasionally feels overly poetic rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Narrative loops on repetitive gathering ritual without plot progression. Opening imagery anchors the story, but lacks traditional arc or resolution. Cosmic timescale weakens pacing within word limit, making structure feel static rather than coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Subterranean orchard fed by star-river creates hauntingly original atmosphere. Synesthesia of tactile memories in fruit, visual starlight patterns, and auditory whispers immerse reader. Sensory details meaningfully connect to both character and concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evokes profound melancholy through paradox of mechanical empathy.
