<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (grief-driven covenant) is clear, but emotional depth remains surface-level; actions align with traits yet lack psychological complexity, relying heavily on exposition rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited word count maintains coherence through tight focus on ritual sequence; cause-effect between object placement and supernatural response is logical but resolution feels abrupt, undercutting narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Catacombs' sensory details (quartz, roots, resonant silence) create haunting atmosphere that mirrors character's internal state; setting functions as active participant in thematic interplay of decay/renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elicits visceral response through precise metaphors (e.g., grief as "spiritual rubble") and subtextual exploration of redemption; pacing occasionally favors poeticism over momentum but maintains emotional undercurrent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique fusion of industrial (blacksmithing) and mystical (covenant) elements; some descriptors border on ornate (e.g., "living roots that had penetrated stone") but generally serve symbolic purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Structured integration of elements creates thematic resonance (artisanship/grief/connection to the divine) while maintaining narrative economy; lingering emotional imprint outweighs minor structural imperfections.</comment>
