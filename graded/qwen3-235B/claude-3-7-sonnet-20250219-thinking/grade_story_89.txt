<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (silent revolution) is clear and consistent, but "zealous warrior" lacks nuanced depth beyond determined actions; internal conflict hinted through "confusing certainty" adds complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The disintegration of the nail and buried time capsules directly drive the plot with logical cause-effect, while the tight word limit achieves a complete arc through cosmic alignment imagery and subtle revolutionary activation.</comment>
