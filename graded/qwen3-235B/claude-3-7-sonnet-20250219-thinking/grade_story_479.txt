<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eliza's identity as a glamorous undertaker is consistently shown through her appearance and meticulous rituals, with clear motivation tied to preserving tradition. Nuanced internal conflict between pride and remorse adds depth, though secondary characters are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The tightly constrained timeframe works well to focus on Eliza's rituals, though the plot's gentle progression feels more cyclical than linear. Pacing maintains tension between legacy and modernity with minimal wasted motion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Evocative sensory details like the "glint" of brass and "hum" of machinery create atmosphere, though opportunities for deeper olfactory/tactile engagement with paint and death are underexplored. The Victorian setting complements the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Measuring as a metaphor for understanding life achieves profound emotional resonance. The juxtaposition of digital archives with ancestral traditions creates meaningful subtext about memory preservation. Ending reinforces central themes with satisfying circularity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids predictability in blending funeral rites with digital age documentation. The "wrist mark" tradition and specific measuring rituals demonstrate ingenuity. Language remains purposefully ornate without crossing into purple prose, maintaining emotional authenticity through concrete details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on death's significance. The compressed format feels intentional, allowing layered themes to develop organically. Concludes with lingering emotional gravity rather than resolution, suitable for literary publication.</comment>
