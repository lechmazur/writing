<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks nuanced inner conflict; motivation is clear but reactions to objects feel more symbolic than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure is cohesive but pivotal transitions (e.g., experiment’s climax) feel rushed; the arc culminates logically despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting is evocative but abstract, relying on poetic visuals over grounded sensory details; tone aligns with cosmic wonder but occasionally veers into vagueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as a garden) and lyrical prose elevate impact; however, the theme’s weight is occasionally undercut by exposition-heavy passages.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging physics with philosophy, but tropes (e.g., lone genius breakthrough) and occasional ornate prose (e.g., “delicious convergence”) hint at formulaic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid interplay of elements creates thematic resonance, but pacing issues and reliance on familiar arcs prevent transcendent cohesion.</comment>
