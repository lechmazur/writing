<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lord Elias's motivation (truth over reputation) is clear and consistent, but his noble status feels underexplored, reducing emotional stakes. His dialogue with the drone lacks distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion between Elias's preparations, the ticking-clock texting, and the explosive conclusion is tight. Some contrived pacing (e.g., messages arriving too conveniently), but the arc achieves completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oppressive lab, hummingbird drone's sensory details, and heat-as-foreshadowing create visceral immersion. Atmosphere flawlessly supports the theme of contained destruction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful closing image (truth surviving combustion) resonates, but emotional subtext is thin. Uses metaphor (fire = truth's consuming force) effectively; dialogue feels overly expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in setting/concept but leans on "sacrificial whistleblower" tropes. Writing style is crisp and purposeful; ticket-stub method feels fresh, though the "final warning" message borders on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements (lab, drone, ticket stubs) are organically integrated. The compressed format enhances tension, with the culminating "Done" message leaving lingering resonance about institutional betrayal.</comment>
