<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong internal conflict and transformation via memories/inscription; motivation of self-deception to truth is consistent, though first-person voice lacks distinctive nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Circular structure anchors the attic as both starting point and emotional resolution; sculptor’s chisel moment disrupts pacing slightly but ties into broader themes cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, symbolic details like dust, brass reflections, and mechanical brokenness create haunting atmosphere; marries theme of stasis vs. potential perfectly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (sculpture, clockwork) deepen narrative; ending subverts violent tropes by redefining "fight"; subtext about responsibility vs. self-protection resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (e.g., redemption isn’t simplistic victory); slight overuse of "broken" motifs; language is lyrical but not purple, with emotionally resonant showing over telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive whole: the attic’s stagnation contrasts with sculptor’s creation, while shard and dreams catalyze introspection—brief but thematically expansive.</comment>
