<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters have implied emotional depth through symbolic actions but lack overt motivation. Actions align with traits (patience, restraint) but internal drives remain underdeveloped. Dialogue is minimal, narration doesn't grant distinct voice to Miyako beyond archetypal "herbalist" tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Intertwined narrative threads provide cohesion but pacing uneven—time progression through meteor seasons works well but the winter resolution remains purely implied. Clear beginning/middle/end structure exists within constraints, yet transitions between symbolic gestures occasionally lack cause-effect clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pagoda roofs, moonlit gardens, and castle setting create immersive atmosphere through precise sensory details. Cultural elements feel authentic but occasionally verge on orientalist caricature. Wasabi-bound book and meteor showers meaningfully connected to setting, though some descriptions (e.g., "restored pagoda roofs") sacrifice specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolic interplay between celestial patterns and botanical arrangements offers rich subtext. Story's theme of communication through absence (unspoken words, unopened letters) resonates emotionally. Subtlety risks undercurrent with reliance on surface-level imagery rather than deeper emotional stakes. Writing style enhances rather than overshadows content.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unique metaphoric pairings (meteor showers as language systems). No formulaic phrases despite ornate conceits. Sensory details specific (42-degree rotations, 3mm adjustments), not generic. Emotional nuance emerges through actions rather than statements. Subtle tension between personal history and cultural constraints feels human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>All elements serve thematic unity—castle-turned-academy frames artistic communication, meteor patterns dictate narrative pacing. Brief length enhances sense of restrained melancholy. Could benefit from sharper emotional climax beyond impending winter conversation. Lingering questions about cultural legacy and personal sacrifice reward sustained reflection.</comment>
