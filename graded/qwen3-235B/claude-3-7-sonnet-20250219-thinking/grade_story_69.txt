<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strengths lie in Fern's internal conflict between tradition and technology; motivations tied to duty and self-discovery. Weakness: some character traits (e.g., "frustratingly uncertain magic") are stated rather than demonstrated through action or consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective micro-arc from obligation to purpose; connections between hologram repairs, theater research, and final installation work conceptually. Weakness: abrupt transition when moving from theater to shop lacks narrative bridge; pacing stumbles slightly at 500-word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic worldbuilding (holograms vs. dwindling nature) established through specific details like rusted doors and fragmented light. Weakness: druidic tradition remains underdeveloped in environmental context; how does her magic interact with this world's physical laws?</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong subtext about art's transient beauty and quiet rebellion; holographic forest's changing patterns symbolize Fern's "common magic." Weakness: some emotional beats (e.g., "lethargic excitement") described rather than embodied through sensory details.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clich√©s by grounding magic in subtle, specific actions (coaxing ferns, seed-crystal infusions). Weakness: "anarchy of broken machinery" verges on abstract; fresher metaphors could have deepened tech-meets-mysticism theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of assigned elements with satisfying resolution. Weakness: library hours framing device and lethargic excitement tone aren't fully capitalized upon for thematic resonance; brevity occasionally sacrifices emotional depth.</comment>
