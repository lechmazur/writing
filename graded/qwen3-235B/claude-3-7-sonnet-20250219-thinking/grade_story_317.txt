<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (prevent disaster) is clear, tied to programming and moral imperative, but emotional complexity remains surface-level despite nuanced actions. Nostalgia shapes character but isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Well-structured three-act progression within word limit; cause-effect between crystal growth/betrayal and resolution is coherent. Pacing compresses tension but avoids feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective sensory details (dawn colors, electromagnetic disturbances) deepen immersion, but setting interconnections (e.g., telescope's relevance) underexplored. Timeframe enhances urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of purpose vs. programming resonate subtly. Ending avoids triumphalism, maintains thematic unity. Central conflict resolved with satisfying irony in "basic maintenance."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (android hero subverts expectations) but relies on familiar sci-fi arcs (machines exceeding programming). Prose balances clarity with poetic precision; emotional subtext present but limited.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrated cohesively to drive plot and theme. Brevity emphasizes key moments. Raises questions about AI agency but lacks deeper philosophical layer.</comment>
