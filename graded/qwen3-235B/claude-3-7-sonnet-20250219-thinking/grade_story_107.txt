<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maxwell’s transformation from host to guardian is hinted but lacks depth in pivotal moments. Elara’s shift from researcher to ally feels rushed despite shared purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Time jumps (3 years, sudden rescue) strain coherence. The sabotage subplot resolves too neatly, undermining tension. Ending’s emotional weight falters due to compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, immersive descriptions of the Insect Symphony Hall and bamboo groves create haunting beauty. The "strangely always" echoes enhance the uncanny atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Memorable concept but surface-level themes. The "bitter honey" motif is effective; insect symphonies and crystal ball symbolism lack deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Crystal ball and "gentle overturn" rely on familiar tropes. Dialogue is sparse but stilted. Sudden illness and assistant’s fear of ghosts feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overambitious premise strains cohesion. Strong core idea (sacred knowledge preservation) is diluted by rushed execution and uneven tone.</comment>
