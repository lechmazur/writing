<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cassandra's sarcasm and panic are evident but her motivation as a disillusioned seer lacks depth. The hands-as-destiny motif ties to her role but feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single revelation with little progression beyond the climactic exchange. The water-ring vision drives the action but the middle lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid neon-dust contrasts and billboard decay establish a haunting atmosphere. Specifics like "plastic-bottled water" anchor the setting but sensory details are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "tombstones of consumerism") and the open-ended resolution elevate the theme. Dialogue borders on expositional; the stewardship debate feels polemical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Environmental fatalism and the "damaged oracle" trope lean clich√©d. The puzzle box's symbolism is fresh but undermined by melodramatic descriptions like "molten sarcasm."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements like the 13 locks and water rings strain for symbolic weight. The brevity creates urgency but sacrifices nuanced exploration of the core conflict.</comment>
