<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh inversion of techno-mage tropes through musical problem-solving; subverts hard sci-fi expectations with lyrical physics while avoiding overwritten prose through precise, purposeful imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere stylistically with inventive flair, but thematic substance doesn't quite match formal ingenuity—leaves impression rather than prompting sustained reflection.</comment>
