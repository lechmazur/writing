<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits (truth-binding, politely vindictive) influence actions but motivation lacks psychological depth; petrification as "growth catalyst" feels conceptually abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically within constraints but pivotal moon-phase petrification mechanism receives insufficient explanation; ending feels abrupt despite thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, atmospheric haunted carnival details enhance mood; dilapidated carousel, skeletal Ferris wheel, and spectral whispers create immersive decay that complements existential themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("cardinal represents transformation") and paradoxical theme ("truth petrifies...reborn") create haunting resonance; circular structure with birds/bookending observation strengthens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with original petrification rationale but occasionally relies on expected gothic descriptors ("weathered," "tattered"); emotional subtext shown through hardened limbs rather than stated fear.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohesive but unevenly weighted; petrification mechanics overshadow atmospheric elements; brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of conscience as both prison and liberation.</comment>
