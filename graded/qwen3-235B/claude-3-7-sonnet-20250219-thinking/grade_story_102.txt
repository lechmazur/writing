<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dravos's coward-to-courage arc is hinted but lacks psychological depth; the apprentice's gravitas feels underexplored. Dialogue serves plot over character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing manages a complete arc within constraints, but the prophecy resolution relies on convenient celestial mechanics. Cause/effect connections feel slightly mechanical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Projection room's celestial atmosphere is vividly realized with sensory contrast (eerie silence vs. star glow). Timeframe and setting enhance thematic weight of silenced knowledge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luminous doubt theme resonates through paradoxical mentorship. Subtext about truth suppression elevates narrative. Ending's emotional restraint enhances thematic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subverts tropes (cowardly mentor, dangerous nursery rhymes) without contrivance. Some metaphors (stars as projections) feel fresh, though minor overuse of "luminous" language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements intentionally serve thematic cohesion. Leaves lingering questions about knowledge ethics. Brief length enhances urgency without feeling restrictive.</comment>
