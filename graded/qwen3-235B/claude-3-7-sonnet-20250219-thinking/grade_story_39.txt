<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's restlessness and secret rebellion are clear, but deeper psychological nuances and internal conflict are underexplored. Motivation is consistent but lacks layered emotional development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed. Cause-effect between encrypted notes and atmospheric processor is logical, though the ending's long-term implications lack resolution within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like Martian fabric and filtered air immerse readers, but sensory engagement is uneven. The biodome's physicality and visual metaphors (e.g., fabric as circuit boards) are strong, though some elements (lantern's emotional weight) could be more deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lantern, fabric) and subtext elevates the narrative. The final line resonates thematically, and "showing" through meticulous actions underscores rebellion. Theme of collective survival through incremental change feels profound and layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar dystopian tropes (e.g., oppressive biodome). Some phrasing ("dust-red desolation") borders on predictable, though the concept of "tailoring revolution" offers fresh perspective. Emotional resonance is primarily shown rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, with the Martian setting and tailoring motif driving both plot and theme. The story's brevity works as a strength, emphasizing perseverance over time. Raises questions about collective action and legacy without overt moralizing.</comment>
