<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thomas’s grief is palpable but motivations lack full psychological nuance; his ‘passionate indifference’ is well-embodied but could explore contradictions deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot flows effectively between external parade and internal reckoning; pacing tightens towards the end but maintains coherence despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts between surface celebration and underground solemnity; sensory details (e.g., silent bell, candle shadows) immerse readers without overemphasis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (bell, ventilation flaw) and layered tone elevate impact; ending resonates with thematic balance between progress and loss.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures; metaphors (e.g., bell as monument) are fresh, and emotional subtext avoids overt telling, though some phrasing borders on lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a cohesive, thematic whole; the bell’s role and societal critique linger post-reading, though not transcendentally.</comment>
