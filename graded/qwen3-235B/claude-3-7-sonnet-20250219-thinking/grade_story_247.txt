<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are implied rather than fully embodied; poetic rituals reveal depth but lack interpersonal dynamics or internal conflict. The poet feels more like a symbolic archetype than a psychologically realized figure.></comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence relies on atmospheric progression rather than conventional structure; the circularity of beginning and ending with the compact closure creates circularity, but emotional momentum feels muted within the word limit.></comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric details—mist, fragmented moonlight, bleeding ink—create a vivid, spiritually charged environment where bonsai forests and darkness become extensions of human interiority.></comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The metaphor of mapping "constellations of feeling" elevates the narrative; subtext about isolation through understanding is poignant. Ending's thematic resonance ("messy, impossible work") feels earned despite minimal conflict.></comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through unconventional pairings (coffee sleeves as confessions, fragmented mirrors as cosmic tools); minimal purple prose. The motif of "bleeding ink forming bonsai" achieves freshness without feeling algorithmic.></comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements despite density; the brief length amplifies the poem-like focus on resonant images. Lingers as meditation on artistry and alienation without overstating themes.></comment>
