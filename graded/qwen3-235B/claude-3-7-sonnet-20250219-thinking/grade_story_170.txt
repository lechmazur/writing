<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character's free-spiritedness is evident but occasionally feels imposed rather than organically integrated; motivation through discovered letters drives plot effectively but lacks deeper psychological nuance in her shame/honor conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but slightly rushed in its emotional resolution; the coral-rehabilitation arc achieves coherence but sacrifices some narrative momentum for thematic closure within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in marine environment enhances tone; atmosphere of scientific legacy and personal reckoning is masterfully rendered through tactile details like tarnished needles and underwater sounds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant metaphor of coral suturing as intergenerational healing; theme of inherited knowledge vs. originality is subtly layered, though ending leans toward sentimentality rather than earned transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction (e.g., "heart of doubt," "hollow echoes of shame"); metaphor of hyphenated naming is inventive, though emotional states are sometimes stated rather than implied through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements coalesce purposefully into a thematically rich narrative; brevity deepens impact rather than limiting it, leaving lingering questions about authorship and legacy that resonate beyond the explicit plot.</comment>
