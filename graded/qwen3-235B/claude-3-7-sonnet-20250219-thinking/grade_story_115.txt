<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (to make amends), but interiority feels filtered through poetic abstraction rather than specific human psychology. The "curious tinkerer" aspect lacks distinctive behavioral markers beyond technical expertise. Emotional reactions to the mask lack nuanced contradiction; introspection leans on aestheticized metaphors rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through the mask-as-physical-metaphor structure, but the connection between nano-city simulation and personal reconciliation lacks psychological causality. Action progression (excavation → reforging → sending) is logical but thematically repetitive; climax feels narratively underserved by the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels in tactile details (whirring lenses, luminescent memory threads) and conceptually cohesive atmosphere (quantum substrate merging organic and synthetic decay). Timeframe device creates symbolic resonance, though the nano-city’s purpose as a "model for human reconciliation" strains credibility—the setting’s scientific extremity sometimes undermines emotional intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storytelling gains power through layered metaphors (mask as friendship/theory/cosmos) and the haunting juxtaposition of technical precision with emotional vulnerability. Ending’s reflective tone ("suspiciously straightforward") rewards careful reading, though some emotional beats rely on stated concepts rather than subtextual richness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality wavers between striking concepts (nano-consciousness metropolis, apology as atomic coding) and AI-typical abstractions ("remorse and forgiveness" as fixed hours). The plague doctor motif avoids cliché, but emotional introspection often defaults to philosophical generalizations rather than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story demonstrates structural cohesion but leans too heavily on conceptual elegance to compensate for limited character development. Assigned elements serve the theme of fragmented wholeness effectively, though the nano-city occasionally feels like ostentatious decoration rather than narrative necessity.</comment>
