<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character acts as conduit for philosophical ideas but lacks emotional depth or personal stakes; motivations implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints but resolution feels overly dense; key connection between thought and matter occurs off-page.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich visual details of machinery and plants create atmosphere but lack visceral tactile/smell elements to fully immerse reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors for consciousness and creation resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract prose; ending conceptually satisfying but affectively muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of mechanical/biological themes undercut by occasional purple prose and tropes (e.g., underground resistance); philosophical ideas show conceptual daring but narrative execution uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor sustains cohesion across elements, but compression flattens complexity; conceptually rich yet execution imperfect for elite standards.</comment>
