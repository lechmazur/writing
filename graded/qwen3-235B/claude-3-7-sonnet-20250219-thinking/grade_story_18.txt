<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fails to deeply explore how 'tragically joyful' influences Gregor's personality beyond surface-level irony; motivations remain underdeveloped despite the emotional premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Relies on rushed emotional beats despite efficient plot mechanics; the transition from statue to freed man lacks psychological weight to match its narrative conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Steam-powered elements function more as aesthetic backdrop than integral worldbuilding; atmospheric potential undercut by shallow sensory engagement beyond visual/auditory cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Achieves emotional resonance through symbolism (ink, hair ties) and thematic clarity about truth, but resolution feels slightly pat for such a high-concept premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subverts 'cursed statue' tropes with telepathy/ink mechanics; avoids clich√© through steampunk specificity, but emotional payoffs remain conventionally sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere thematically yet occasionally strain under brevity requirements; the fusion of concept/character feels intentional but slightly strained in execution.</comment>
