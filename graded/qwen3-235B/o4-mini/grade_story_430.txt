<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's closed-off nature is thematically implied through metaphor (mask, trembling fingertips) but lacks behavioral consistency or evolving motivations. Psychological depth remains surface-level despite poetic language. Internal conflict feels more symbolic than psychologically plausible. Dialogue in final scenes lacks distinct voice or narrative justification.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot is amorphous and impressionistic, relying on thematic resonance over narrative progression. The central action of preserving/receiving papers serves more as recurring motif than plot driver. Pacing alternates between lingering on sensory details and abrupt tonal shifts. Resolution feels vague and inconclusive despite poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic imagery creates vivid, immersive atmosphere with rich sensory details (fractured light, tactile descriptions of decay and beauty). The setting functions as both physical space and psychological landscape, mirroring character's internal duality. Surreal elements enhance thematic exploration of fragmented truth and legacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful use of extended metaphors, symbolic motifs, and lyrical imagery creates lasting emotional impact. Subtext about generational trauma cycles and transcendence aspirations resonates through paper-as-inheritance concept. Lacks explicit character dimensionality but compensates with thematic potency and memorable sensory experiences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strikes a balance between original worldbuilding and familiar emotional territory. Avoids genre tropes through surreal presentation but occasionally leans on overly poetic phrasing that verges on purple prose. Emotional complexity emerges from associative imagery rather than direct exposition, though some metaphors strain for meaning rather than organic development.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Element integration is often poetic but occasionally disjointed - the timeframe "before the first lie" conceptually aligns with themes but lacks concrete narrative function. The park setting and reaver concept synergize well, but the kissing-paper-as-stargazing method feels more symbolic than dramatically cohesive. Leaves haunting impression but could benefit from tighter structural focus.</comment>
