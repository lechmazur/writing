<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mayor's grumpiness is consistent but underdeveloped; his transformation feels narratively imposed rather than organically earned through action or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on conveniently abrupt shifts (e.g., beetle activation, monks' ritual); pacing within tight word limits unevenly balances wonder with narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with sensory details, but the carnival's fleeting presence and monks' function feel underwoven into cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolism elevate the prose, but emotional depth remains surface-bound; themes of renewal echo without piercing subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in concept (mechanical relic + polluted orchard), but leans on tropes of "chosen outsider" and magical artifact; occasional overwritten phrasing diminishes authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a self-contained mythos, but brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of ideas; memorable for atmosphere over narrative innovation.</comment>
