<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Character feels symbolic rather than tangible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vague progression; lacks traditional structure or clear cause-effect. Feels more like a mood piece than a coherent narrative with meaningful momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich atmosphere with vivid sensory details—bird calls, amber lamps, and glass chambers—create an immersive, contemplative mood that mirrors emotional tones.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance and lyrical prose evoke reflection. Subtext about memory and emotion is layered, though plot minimalism weakens conventional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés with fresh metaphors ("translation of heartbeats"), but occasional ornate phrasing risks veering into poetic abstraction over emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>Conceptually ambitious but structurally fragile; elements coexist more than interweave. Leaves a lingering mood but lacks narrative weight or subversion.</comment>
