<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's aloofness informs emotional distance but lacks depth in how orphanhood specifically shapes reactions; motivation to transform fear into courage feels abstract rather than organically tied to concrete past trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows discovery-to-resolution arc but pivotal moments (like deciphering scrawl) lack emotional/psychological build-up; pacing unevenly rushes some cause-effect sequences while lingering artificially on descriptive loops.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through gravity distortion and sensory details (oil stains, thuds) is evocative but under-leverages the surreal setting to deepen thematic contrasts; tone oscillates between clinical and sentimental without intentional dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of gravitational anomaly as metaphor for psychological entrapment and release; ending achieves emotional resonance through physicalized internal struggle, though some lyrical overreach complicates subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("softly audible," "affectionate detachment") feels mechanical; gravitates toward poetic abstractions over specific sensory anchoring; emotional arc relies on stated proverbs rather than embodied nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly coherent but occasionally additive rather than synergistic; short length sacrifices character interiority while enabling focused mythic allegory; lingering thematic questions about adaptability justify brevity.</comment>
