<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by poetic labels rather than actions; motivation to calm crowds is clear but lacks emotional depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed, with cosmic stakes and resolution arriving abruptly; cause-effect relationships thin despite cohesive arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Concept-driven but uneven; ambitious synthesis of elements falters under inconsistent execution, leaving ideas underexplored.</comment>
