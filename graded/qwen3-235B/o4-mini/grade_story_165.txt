<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is a vessel for the plot rather than a person with recognizable psychology, voice, or conflict; motivation is stated but lacks emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear arc but feels compressed and episodic, with cause-and-effect progression driven more by mechanical plot devices than organic development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere with vivid sensory details, though the initial "silent forest" timeframe feels disconnected from the primary underground setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolic resonance in the butterfly and garden, but emotional impact is diluted by underdeveloped character interiority and thematic simplicity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in its core elements (e.g., stained glass butterfly) but relies on familiar fantasy tropes; prose alternates between lyrical precision and self-indulgent ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but lack deeper synthesis; the story is competently constructed but lacks urgency or lingering resonance beyond its immediate plot.</comment>
