<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but lack deeper human motivation or internal conflict. The actor's dual nature is established but doesn't evolve through action, feeling more like a label than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from artifact discovery to revelation with fluidity but lacks tension. Resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, with cause-effect tied more to poetic logic than character agency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive worldbuilding with tactile historical decay and industrial remnants. Sensory details (sunlight patterns, dust motes) create hauntingly specific atmosphere that embodies 'anxious serenity.'</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and rich metaphors ('spectral fingerprints of grief') evoke emotion, but some themes (reproduction of empathy) remain abstract. Ending resonates conceptually rather than viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original framing of historical mystery through theatrical reconstruction, but risks overwrought prose ('chameleon stage actor') and predictable melancholic tone. Nearly crosses into purple prose with excessive adjectives.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist beautifully but feel curated rather than organically connected. The concise format limits depth but serves as a poignant vignette. Memorable sensory tapestry lingers, if not fully transformative.</comment>
