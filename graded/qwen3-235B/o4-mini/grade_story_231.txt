<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations beyond poetic generalities; sentimental and spontaneous traits present but insufficiently drive decisions or reveal depth through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative flows logically but feels rushed, with pivotal moments (e.g., schemers’ deliberation) underdeveloped; structure is complete but pacing uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery clashes with vague connections between setting and plot; Sumerian palace aesthetic emphasizes grandeur but fails to anchor thematic or character logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eloquent prose and symbolic resonance (e.g., “price of justice”) elevate impact, but emotional beats rely too heavily on telling over showing, diluting authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwrought descriptions and predictable tension between order/chaos suggest formulaic aspirations; fresh metaphors are drowned in ornate abstraction and tonal inconsistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Polished surface dazzles but struggles to fuse elements cohesively; themes resonate faintly but are undercut by underexplored conflicts and a flimsy plot-logic.</comment>
