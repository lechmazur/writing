<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is conceptually integrated but lacks depth beyond assigned traits; actions align with motivation, but voice and internal thoughts remain abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Circular structure emphasizes mood over plot; lacks clear progression or conflict resolution; cohesive within constraints but feels static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere with immersive sensory details (e.g., "suspended cantatas," "phantom pages") perfectly complements blithe discontent and vanishing legacy themes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (ink preserving music, stars as timeframe) tempered by occasional overwrought phrasing ("flight feathers"); avoids most AI clich√©s.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, but structural minimalism and abstract tone may challenge readers seeking traditional narrative momentum.</comment>
