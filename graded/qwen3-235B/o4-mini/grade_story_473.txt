<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Alaric's traits as an eccentric cartographer and leader are conceptually distinct, but motivations lack emotional depth despite consistent alignment with his "pruning fate" objective. Actions feel overly symbolic, sacrificing human nuance for metaphorical weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of subversive leadership, but pacing feels compressed—some transitions between workshop scenes and fate-pruning mechanics strain cause-effect logic. Conclusion provides closure but sacrifices tension resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting merges ecological anxiety with corporate dystopia vividly. Sensory details (humming solar panels, ripening fruit) create haunting atmosphere. Timeframe of workshops grounds the surreal elements in cyclical ritual.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (fate-as-orchard, corporate brochures-as-maps) offer intellectual resonance. Ending achieves bittersweet catharsis but undersells emotional stakes. Subtext about language shaping reality is compelling yet unevenly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in concept, but relies on hyper-stylized prose ("circuits of solar panels reflected his solemn silhouette") that occasionally veers into self-parody. Avoids genre tropes but overcorrects with dense metaphorical scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a conceptual mosaic—the elements form a cohesive thesis on control vs. chaos. Style occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity, but the central tension about leadership's moral cost lingers.</comment>
