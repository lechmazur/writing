<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to grasp sacred geometry drives actions, but inner conflict lacks visceral depth. The transformation feels inevitable rather than earned through nuanced internal struggle. Assigned attribute of crisis shapes surface behavior but not psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pirate radio method introduces compelling tension but relies on vague "static pulses" as a deus ex machina. The elevator farewell creates narrative bookends, yet the sacred geometry revelation arrives without sufficient groundwork. Pacing falters during abstract epiphany sequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marble blueprints and incandescent halos create tactile atmosphere, but digital migration archive remains abstract. The elevator's closing doors establish haunting temporal dissonance. Sensory details dazzle visually but lack olfactory/gustatory grounding. The "shifting corridors" need clearer spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Celestial rhythm geometry as metaphor for timeless collaboration resonates. Subtext about knowledge preservation vs. discovery emerges through card-recess interactions. Ending achieves thematic closure but emotional beats remain intellectualized. Sacred proportions motif unifies form/content.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through geometric mysticism fusion. The "digital tombs" conceit and "incandescent halo" showcase linguistic freshness. Some static descriptions border on ornate ("whispered of unspoken bonds"), but overall style maintains purposeful abstraction without succumbing to purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function synergistically but lack surprise - the archive-as-labyrinth concept follows expected mythopoeic logic. The elevator framing device elevates narrative cohesion. Lingering questions about knowledge commodification emerge, though thematic ambition slightly outpaces emotional penetration.</comment>
