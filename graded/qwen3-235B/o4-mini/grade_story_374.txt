<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters exhibit minimal depth; motivations hinted through symbolic actions but lack emotional resonance. The inherited rivalry shifts abruptly from conflict to cooperation without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within constraints, transitioning from isolation to collaboration. Pacing uneven; cloud-reading motif sustains momentum but lacks narrative stakes. Resolution feels abrupt yet thematically consistent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (hay/neon, hoofbeats/elevators) establish a unique atmosphere, but the setting’s potential as a character is underutilized. Tone oscillates between wonder and mundane routine without full synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and cosmic symbolism elevate the prose, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract exposition. The conflict’s thematic resolution (unity through cosmic observation) is satisfying, though predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Original premise (futuristic stables, cloud-reading) avoids clichés, but metaphors (“thunderheads promising revelations”) verge on overused. Shift from rivalry to alliance feels formulaic; emotional subtext lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially due to tight focus on atmosphere and motif. The brevity serves the lyrical tone but sacrifices deeper exploration of inherited conflict and cosmic themes.</comment>
