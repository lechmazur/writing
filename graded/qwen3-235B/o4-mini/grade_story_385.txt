<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marlow's manipulative motives are clear but lack psychological depth; his "meddling" relies on poetic abstraction over concrete actions that reveal personality. The ice skates' role in memory extraction feels symbolically heavy-handed without earning emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing lurches between lyrical description and plotless meandering; the connection between decoding symbols and patient interactions remains abstract. The ending's "glyph" revelation lacks narrative payoff despite strong atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive fusion of sterile hospital and mystical beach elements; contrasts between obsidian skyscraper and shifting sands create potent metaphorical tension. Sensory details (rust smell, fluorescent hum, sand textures) anchor the uncanny atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegantly constructed symbolic web linking ice skates, footprints, and glyphs provokes intellectual engagement. However, emotional resonance remains distant; the theme of decoding fractured memory/identity is compelling but under-embodied in character interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Verbal embroidery (e.g., "lucidly confused") and repetitive nature metaphors verge on purple prose. The plot structure—connecting hospital caregiver to arcane beach rituals—feels archetypal rather than revelatory, with emotional beats declared rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Successfully combines disparate elements into a haunting whole but struggles to balance poetic abstraction with narrative substance. The symbolic convergence satisfies intellectually but lacks visceral impact or thematic boldness.</comment>
