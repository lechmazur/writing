<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivation are conceptually clear but undernourished; actions reflect assigned elements yet lack psychological depth or distinct voice. The aloof/intimate duality is evoked but not meaningfully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through the card-reading ritual to reveal an ideological resolution. The arc is coherent but static, feeling more like a poetic vignette than a structurally complex narrative. Timeframe and concept tie together but middle lacks dynamic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prehistoric/technological fusion creates gripping atmosphere. Sensory details like "flickering lamplight" and "primordial tides" immerse readers. The study center's mundane enchantment contrasts meaningfully with the bard's mystical act, though its full potential remains slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolism elevate the narrative. The hidden message resonates thematically, blending intellectual and emotional appeal. While the conflict between human creativity and AI is shown through gesture rather than action, the poetic prose creates lasting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures through unusual temporal/symbolic combinations. Language is purposeful but occasionally borders on ornate. The struggle against algorithmic domination is rendered with originality, though some phrases ("distant echoes from chorus") verge on abstraction without visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesive and stylistically accomplished, but the vignette-like structure lacks urgent narrative stakes. Combines elements inventively, leaving readers with thematic contemplation rather than lasting emotional impact. Publishable, but not transcendent.</comment>
