<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (memorializing failures through tea rituals, seeking redemption in waterfalls) are coherent and consistent with his irate, guilt-ridden personality, but internal conflict lacks nuanced introspection beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing feels compressed; the plot’s emotional arc (obsessive ritual → discovery of waterfall) works within constraints, but the transition to climax lacks visceral buildup, making the resolution slightly underwhelming.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, alien atmosphere with precise sensory details (hissing steam, biofluorescent moss) creates immersive contrast between decay and redemption; setting deeply intertwined with themes of fragmented memory and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (tea patterns as “constellations of regret,” waterfalls as salvation) are evocative, and the ending’s symbolic immersion resonates emotionally, though some lines verge on overly ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imagery is original but occasionally repetitive (“caffeinated acid,” “biting sincerity”); avoids clichés in setting and object use but occasionally defaults to lyrical abstraction over concrete character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong despite ambitious scope; the theme of rebellion through memorialization is compelling, though the story leans heavily on atmosphere over narrative urgency to sustain its premise.</comment>
