<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth; "loyally unique" feels underexplored beyond abstract declarations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels compressed; skirmish resolution with guards via ledger manipulation lacks sufficient dramatic buildup or logical motivation for their shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes ancient temple and turbines intriguingly but lacks visceral sensory immersion; atmosphere relies too heavily on vague poeticism over concrete details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Idea-rich but unevenly realized; ambitious themes and imagery are hindered by compressed pacing, underdeveloped setting integration, and inconsistent tonal balance.</comment>
