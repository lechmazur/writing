<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has vivid traits but lacks emotional depth; "serene anger" and flightiness are visually rendered but underexplored psychologically. Motivation is clear but inconsistently integrated into actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Premise exists but lacks traditional narrative arc; progression feels static despite lyrical descriptions. Pacing uneven in word-constrained structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with candlelit sensory details, but timeframe ambiguity and underdeveloped setting interactions prevent full immersion. Object/setting relationship partially realized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphors elevate the piece, but emotional resonance remains surface-level. Ending achieves thematic unity but lacks visceral impact. Demonstrates "showing" but incomplete subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional purple prose and overly-ornate descriptors. Some metaphors feel deliberate rather than organic; avoids clich√©s but at risk of self-indulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack narrative urgency; style serves mood over message. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful; lingers more than resonates.</comment>
