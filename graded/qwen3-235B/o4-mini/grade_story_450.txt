<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like sharp wit and denial are demonstrated through abstract actions, but internal monologue lacks distinct voice. Motivation to fulfill prophecy through exclusion feels slightly underexplored. The spaceship patch interaction reveals depth, but physicality of dancing remains more symbolic than immersive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prophecy arc resolves coherently but relies on dense exposition. The pivotal act of smiling into the camera lacks narrative momentum built by earlier introspection. Timeframe compression sacrifices some emotional weight in transition from ambivalence to acceptance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually rich chamber details (curved monitors, iridescent condensation) establish uncanny atmosphere. Ambivalent tone permeates descriptions of cosmic wreckage and familial decay. Sensory immersion occasionally overpowers logical connections between setting elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (cosmic failure/family legacy) enriches themes. Subtextual tension between preservation and destruction resonates. Ending's glyph revelation lacks sufficient grounding in earlier imagery, reducing narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surreal fusion of domestic and cosmic elements. Some metaphors veer toward abstraction ("starched into frames"), risking vagueness. Emotional states emerge through symbolically charged actions rather than explicit declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements function cohesively but unevenly. The chamber and prophecy drive narrative, while "bubble baths" feel decorative. Conceptual density rewards rereading but risks alienating readers seeking clearer emotional throughline.</comment>
