<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains static and underexplored; 'gleefully morose' is stated but not demonstrated through concrete actions or choices that reveal psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative progression feels inevitable rather than driven by character decisions; lacks clear stakes or obstacles to create meaningful tension within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, synesthetic descriptions (ozone, flickering light, rusted gears) create immersive atmosphere that thematically supports the decay/renewal duality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Competent execution of genre constraints with minor structural fissures; lacks definitive thematic punch that would distinguish it in elite literary markets.</comment>
