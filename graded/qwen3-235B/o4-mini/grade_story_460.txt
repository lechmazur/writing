<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character is symbolic and thematically aligned with actions/traits, but lacks explicit growth; motivations are clear but abstract rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from wandering to revelation, but progression feels inevitable rather than dramatic; pacing is efficient but impact is muted by brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly imagined with sensory details (acid rain, neon fungi) that enhance mood and thematic contrast between decay/renewal; feels integral rather than decorative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphors (stained glass, "nightless sky") elevate craft, but emotional resonance is uneven; deeper subtext about rebuilding is potent yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose leans on ornate, occasionally clich√©d phrasing ("poisoned droplets") but avoids formulaicity through symbolic specificity; thematic ambition partly offsets stylistic unevenness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven into a unified vision, but innovation lies in thematic synthesis rather than structural daring; lingers through mood more than narrative complexity.</comment>
