<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters lack interiority; motivations (outrunning nightmare, embracing diversity) are narrative devices rather than deeply felt needs. Marisol's supernatural role remains underexplored despite driving the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure (class → grotto → séance) creates dissonance; cooking-class-to-nightmare-escape transition feels forced. Pacing sacrifices emotional weight for plot density; thematic resolution arrives abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Ethereal details (bioluminescent vines, stardust stew) are vivid but tonally inconsistent—culinary logic clashes with cosmic horror. Shadows as "patrols" undermine atmospheric coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (chess as resilience, stew as unity) enrich thematic layering. Ending satisfies thematically but relies on explicit declarations ("strength in diversity") rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends supernatural and mundane (radio-host/chef) but relies on AI-friendly imagery (e.g., "cloak of stars"). Avoids clichés (nightmare ≠ monster tropes) yet occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction (e.g., "tapestry of resilience").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion strained by over-stuffed elements (cooking class, chess, rebellion). Strong imagery lingers, but thematic integration is uneven—feels like a draft needing tighter unifying vision.</comment>
