<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Promising thematic integration of timidity and compassion, but lacks distinct character voice beyond archetypal "radiant victim" trope. Internal conflict remains abstract, motivation feels more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear emotional arc but relies on symbolic gestures substituting for causality. Pacing alternates between poetic lingerings and abrupt climactic shifts that undermine narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully blends decay and hope through tactile details, though the factory/temple juxtaposition could delve deeper. Sensory textures elevate setting into active metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Poetic language and symbolic resonance impress, but emotional impact never quite transcends its own metaphors. Subtext about quiet power works best when action precedes declaration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Too many phrases repeat recognizable AI-era aesthetic patterns ("fractured mosaics", "phoenix dreamers"). Attempts at lyrical originality occasionally veer into overloaded ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Successfully binds assigned elements into cohesive metaphor, but some feel checked-off rather than organically integrated. Length constraints expose dependence on conceptual scaffolding over character-driven momentum.</comment>
