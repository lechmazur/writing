<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains largely symbolic; survival traits described but not fully demonstrated through distinct actions or voice. Motivation to "harvest hope" is consistent but lacks depth in emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Loose circular structure between entering/leaving temple, but lacks tight cause/effect progression. Pacing meanders through atmospheric descriptions rather than driven plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details create immersive atmosphere, though overused metaphors risk dilution. Setting's symbolic resonance with themes is strong but occasionally overwhelms narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic unity elevate impact, but emotional payoff remains abstract. Some telling rather than showing undermines full immersion in character transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Repeated phrases ("across unwritten calendars") and thematic symmetry suggest formulaic patterns. Metaphors often archetypal rather than freshly imagined; poetic style occasionally veers into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist more than cohereâ€”temporal motifs feel superimposed rather than integral. Strong imagery compensates for schematic plotting, with thematic persistence outweighing narrative innovation.</comment>
