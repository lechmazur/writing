<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character voice is underdeveloped; motives implied through action but lack psychological depth. "Irritatingly perfect" remains stylistic flourish, not integrated with internal logic or decision-making. Methods don't reveal distinctive traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Loose arc from discovery to descent, but progression feels fragmented. Scenes rely on poetic abstraction rather than causal momentum. Pacing alternates between stagnant imagery and abrupt revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory palette (mossy friezes, trembling temple) creates immersive antiquity. Atmosphere occasionally sabotaged by overwritten phrases ("shimmering pattern scrawled in invisible ink").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lustrous metaphors (truth as symphony, album as key) elevate language but often remain symbolic ornament rather than emotional conduit. Ending lacks narrative or thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive abstraction ("tears tracing grooves in silk") borders on purple prose. Sudden transitions (statue discovery, inscription deciphering) suggest algorithmic convenience over organic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion appears stitched-together; elements serve as decorative props rather than narrative muscles. Short form exploited superficially, lacking tension between constraint and ambition.</comment>
