<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Poorly defined personal stakes despite elaborate symbolism; motivations are abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Character acts as a thematic vessel rather than a psychologically complex entity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Static observational structure lacks traditional plot progression; atmospheric tension substitutes for narrative momentum. Coded skits function more as poetic devices than consequential actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (flickering lantern, moth wings) successfully build eerie beauty, but setting remains conceptually idealized rather than spatially coherent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally transcends into genuine emotional resonance but often collapses under weight of conflicting metaphors. Attempts at subtext about communal resilience only partially emerge.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some originality in juxtaposing absurd humor with spiritual struggle, yet formulaic "labyrinth of silent alleys" tropes and overly calculated symbolism undercut uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>All elements utilized but unevenly synthesized; atmospheric and thematic cohesion counterbalanced by lack of substantial character arc or transformative action within constraints.</comment>
