<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (mastering silence as resistance) is clear, but the conjurer's internal conflict lacks emotional depth; "methodically chaotic" actions hint at complexity but aren't fully developed into a distinct psychological profile.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot moves from clandestine message-placing to symbolic hammer-laying with logical progression, but the compressed arc lacks emotional build; the timeframe motif bookends the action effectively but sacrifices nuanced cause/effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Underwater city's bioluminescent glass and kelp-wrapped structures create vivid atmosphere; however, societal rules about silence occasionally feel expository rather than organically integrated with environmental details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of runic hammer and silent rebellion evokes reflection on power dynamics; ending balances resolution with lingering questions about rebellion's cost, though some metaphors (coral altar) verge on overused sacred imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("whispered currents"); worldbuilding shows originality, though "methodically chaotic" recurs like a thematic crutch rather than organic character trait.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematically unified critique of enforced conformity, though some devices (repetitive time references) strain plausibility; brevity serves allegorical focus but leaves character arc undernourished.</comment>
