<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Flickering motivations; overzealousness remains abstract, actions driven more by vague obsession than concrete psychological realism. Limited behavioral specificity beyond atmospheric gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Disjointed progression; vignettes accumulate without clear narrative causality. Resolution feels abrupt despite poetic resonance, structural coherence strained by lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie fusion of decay and beauty through rusted concrete/golden leaf contrasts. Sensory alchemy creates haunting liminality, though post-dream timeframe underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gorgeous imagery and synesthetic metaphors ("apple varieties hum"), but thematic clarity wavers. Subtext about inherited memory is powerful yet unevenly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors undercut by occasional purple prose ("chaos marched in neat rows"). Evocative moments outweigh, but tonal consistency falters mid-story.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Idea-density captivates, but forced cohesion between elements diminishes impact. Lingering atmosphere compensates structural weaknesses, yet feels more conceptually ambitious than execution achieves.</comment>
