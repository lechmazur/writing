<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's naivety is implied but underexplored; motivation feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Actions prioritize poetic imagery over coherent psychological progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through vivid tableaus, but lacks strong causal links; transitions between events feel disconnected despite atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details create a richly textured vault-world, but specificity falters under scrutiny (e.g., "distant warmth" remains unanchored conceptually).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "seeds of understanding" resonate thematically; ending delivers emotional resonance through tactile, symbolic rituals rather than explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality in blending mysticism with media metaphors ("commercials"), but occasional purple prose and overreliance on abstract phrases slightly dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story impressively synthesizes all elements into a thematically unified whole, though some threads remain underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>
