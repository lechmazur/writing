<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characters are richly described but lack emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through conflict-driven choices. Assigned attributes influence surface-level traits but don't fully shape nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through poetic vignettes but lacks a clear narrative arc. The interconnection between preservation efforts and romantic tension remains underdeveloped within the constrained word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overwrought descriptions and generalized sensory details suggest formulaic writing. While subverting typical cultural revival tropes through "imperfect love," emotional authenticity feels strained by excessive abstraction.</comment>
