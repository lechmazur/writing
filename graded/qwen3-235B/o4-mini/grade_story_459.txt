<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character possesses distinct traits (elegantly clumsy, ghost-seeing) and symbolic objects that shape behavior, but lacks emotional depth and explicit growth despite implied liberation. Motivation to "let go" remains abstract without concrete conflict or transformation benchmarks.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Structure shows progression of acceptance but feels episodic rather than plot-driven. Timeframe compression forces abrupt shifts; cause-and-effect between ghost research and emotional release lacks sufficient connective tissue. Pacing meanders despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through precise sensory details (whispering wind, wax drips, cold presences) and tonal contrasts between decay and beauty. The sand castle lab's symbolic connection to impermanence is evocative but underutilized in advancing character arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong literary craftsmanship with resonant metaphors (flower crown as armor, eroding castles) and thematic coherence. However, tension remains diffuse; abstract introspection dominates over concrete stakes or emotional payoff that would deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of occupational specificity (elevator technician) with supernatural inquiry avoids genre tropes. Some phrases teeter toward lyrical excess, but generally avoids AI-style repetition or tonal shifts. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolic gestures rather than explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively interwoven (setting supports theme, objects carry symbolic weight) but overall impact lacks urgency. The brevity works aesthetically if not narratively, leaving lingering mood over concrete resolution while maintaining conceptual sophistication.</comment>
