<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Warrior's arc from hubris to humility is symbolically sketched but lacks psychological depth; motivations shift abruptly without sufficient emotional underpinnings despite poetic gestures toward inner transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical progression toward clarity anchors the non-linear structure, yet the compressed arc feels hurried; cause-effect connections between self-realization and escape rely heavily on abstract epiphany rather than logical narrative beats within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visually rich with sticky, buzzing textures and amber horrors, yet atmospheric cohesion falters where balloon pops as "distant artillery" jar against the otherwise organic insect-hive logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("intimately impersonal tapestry") and resonant imagery create lingering unease, though emotional distance from the symbolic character prevents deeper visceral engagement despite technical proficiency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of hive-thought existentialism with tactile horror avoids genre tropes; precise, almost clinical prose tempers ornate descriptions, though soliloquy device verges on contrived philosophical scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elegantly constructed as conceptual allegory, but the rigid adherence to abstract themes occasionally strangles narrative flow; elements serve the metaphor more than the human experience.</comment>
