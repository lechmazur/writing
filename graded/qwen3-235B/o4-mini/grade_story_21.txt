<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually stated but lack depth in emotional lived experience; actions driven by revenge rather than diplomacy weaken the diplomat archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has a discernible arc but suffers from compressed pacing that forces exposition; drum circles and data purge feel contrived rather than organic developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere dominates through textured sensory decay - marble dust, fox tassel fibers, echoing drums - that transcends the word count with immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional undercurrents of genetic corruption work well, but heavy thematic portent occasionally overwhelms narrative economy; genome decryption as metaphor has intellectual force.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some sections exhibit overwritten tendencies ("abrasive calm," "bitter calculus") but avoids direct clich√©s through biological revenge mechanisms; occasionally strains under the weight of its own vocabulary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but feel occasionally checklist-driven; short form works for thematic punch but sacrifices character breathing room; ending resolves thematic throughline effectively.</comment>
