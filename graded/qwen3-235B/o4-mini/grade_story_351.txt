<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character defined primarily through poetic abstractions over psychological depth; motivation to "stand by the unremembered" drives action but traits lack complexity beyond metaphorical descriptions. Formal rebellion feels underexplored in concrete behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from riddle-solving to station's transformation, but relies heavily on symbolic action rather than causal logic. Pacing balances lyrical reflection with minimal narrative momentum, leaving structural cohesion contingent on thematic interpretation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and immersive; every sensory detail reinforces decay, memory, and quiet intensity. The ivy-choked station becomes a living metaphor, its architecture interacting meaningfully with character and concept through spatial and temporal symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and layered symbolism create intellectual resonance, with "delicate undoing" as both thematic and literal mechanism. Poetic voice enhances impact but occasional abstraction dilutes emotional urgency. Ending circles ritualistically rather than resolving, leaving conceptual weight to carry the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Style avoids overt clich√©s through original metaphors, yet risks purple prose with dense descriptive cascades. Subtle use of recurring motifs (shadows, cracks, whispers) adds cohesion, though some phrasing borders on stylistic excess without purposeful modulation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function interdependently rather than feeling imposed, but thematic ambition occasionally overshadows narrative urgency. The brevity magnifies poetic density at the expense of deeper character engagement, leaving impact more contemplative than visceral.</comment>
