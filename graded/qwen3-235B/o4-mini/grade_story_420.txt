<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is thin, motivations hinted but not deeply explored. Reactions to objects are poetic but lack emotional depth. No distinct voice in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot has a beginning/middle/end structure but feels contrived. Transitions between actions lack causal clarity. Pacing rushes through pivotal moments, coherence strained by compressed development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly described but disconnected from character stakes. Sensory details emphasize abstraction over tangible immersion. Setting’s grandeur doesn’t organically influence the sculptor’s dilemma.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate the prose, but emotional resonance is surface-level. Theme of transformation is consistent. Ending feels symbolic but lacks narrative or character payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Unique combination of elements avoids clichés, but language veers into ornate abstraction. Subtext is present but drowned out by excessive metaphor. Tonal consistency wavers between mystical and weary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through poetic throughlines, but the story leans on assigned elements as crutches. Tight length limits reflection; themes are stated rather than embodied. Lingering impact is visual, not emotional.</comment>
