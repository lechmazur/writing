<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character’s solitude and meticulous nature drive actions but backstory remains underexplored; motivations feel consistent though not deeply interrogated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from isolation to decision to attend party; pacing balances internal conflict and external action within word limit; minor dips in momentum during introspection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Icy setting meticulously rendered with sensory specificity; atmosphere amplifies tension between isolation and connection; metaphors like “frost as mind” deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (black rose, board games as life metaphors) and subtext about courage; ending feels purposeful but slightly overstated in its thematic emphasis on courage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with inventive phrasing and unexpected juxtapositions (party invitation disrupting solitude), but some metaphors (despair as predator) rely on familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize to explore isolation/courage duality; brevity feels intentional but resolution leans slightly predictable; memorable for tone and imagery.</comment>
