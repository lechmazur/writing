<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Android's "nostalgia" and "anxiously fearless" traits remain abstract descriptors; actions driven solely by plot demands rather than internal logic. No discernible voice or emotional nuance in synthetic character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot progression exists but feels mechanistic; key developments (crystal chamber fizz, betrayal) introduced abruptly. Pacing lurches between slow atmosphere and sudden crisis, undermining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Generic sci-fi descriptors ("subterranean library," "levitation grids") create vague atmosphere. Sensory details are present but lack specificity or emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "minutes stretched like fragile glass" attempt poetic impact but surface themes (betrayal, loyalty) are underdeveloped. Emotional beats rely on exposition rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Repetitive adjectives ("shimmering," "pale"), clich√©d phrases ("gilded fingers"), and overly logical android behavior betray formulaic construction. Tropes (lonely AI caretaker, internal betrayal) lack subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but haphazardly integrated; levitation mechanics and crystal systems feel like checklist items rather than organic components. Ending resolves nothing thematically.</comment>
