<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inconsistent depth in character motivations; the blacksmith's artistic drive is clear but lacks visceral emotional grounding, while secondary characters like Celeste remain underexplored despite pivotal roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function effectively with the ozone crisis driving tension, but the compressed word limit strains resolution of key arcs (e.g., paddleboarding backstory feels shoehorned rather than integrated into narrative momentum).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere with ozone alarms and molten steel, though underdeveloped sensory textures (e.g., tactile experience of quarantine barriers) prevent full environmental embodiment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (frozen ozone crystals as "miniature auroras") and thematic cohesion around sacrifice elevate emotional resonance, though some abstract phrasing dilutes visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique element combinations (blacksmith/ozone science), but occasionally lapses into ornamental abstraction rather than concrete human specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere around an urgent central metaphor, though some (paddleboarding bond) feel more symbolic than narratively essential within tight constraints.</comment>
