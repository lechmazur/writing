<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations (preserving indigenous wisdom) are clear and consistent with actions, but lacks psychological depth; iconic symbolism overshadows individuality, making "mild-mannered" aspects underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression from problem-solving to resolution, but tight word limits create compressed causality; pivotal moments (dice spinning) feel earned but pacing lacks nuanced emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie neon/chalk juxtaposition creates strong visual contrast; sensory details (chrome coffee, vibrating air) immerse reader, but retro-futurism's connection to indigenous themes remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (dice as cultural fulcrum) and mythic resonance elevate impact; thematically cohesive but relies on telling ("hope that mechanical reconstruction could awaken") rather than visceral emotional embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through syncretic indigenous-tech fusion; some phrases ("organized disorder") verge on poetic abstraction; emotional weight occasionally diluted by lush descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into resonant metaphor for cultural preservation; slight unevenness in execution (e.g., trapper's mechanical intuition feels more thematic than viscerally dramatized) prevents absolute cohesion.</comment>
