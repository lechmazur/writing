<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits like dry wit are evident, but motivation falters: sentinel's desire to learn ghostly methods lacks deeper emotional grounding, making his actions feel overly plot-driven rather than psychologically resonant. Subtle shifts in behavior (e.g., freeing the ghost) align with goals but lack internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (arrival-debate-dance-resolution), but pacing stumbles in tight word count: interactions with the rope and ghost feel rushed, and the central conflict (confiscation vs. desire) resolves too neatly. Connection between the crossed-off names and the ghost’s release remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (cold drafts, velvet curtain, rustling gown) create a vividly eerie atmosphere. The lighthouse setting's decay aligns with themes of eroding promises. Overuse of "reckless precision" and "faded heartbeat" descriptions occasionally distracts but rarely undermines immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (dance as negotiation, rope as symbolic tether) deepen thematic resonance. The story shows rather than tells emotions well (e.g., ghost’s flickering expression), but the ending feels slightly pat, diluting the potential for lingering tension. Central theme of broken vs. renewed trust emerges cohesively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on familiar ghost-story tropes (whispering names, haunted mirrors) without subverting them. Language has poetic flourishes ("inked promises slipped like sand") without veering into purple prose. Emotional beats are implied organically, though the sentinel’s transformation remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Elements are tightly woven—haunted setting, frayed rope, and dance method all contribute to the narrative. However, the story’s brevity limits thematic exploration, and the sentinel’s internal journey (from detached duty to mutual trust) feels underexplored. Memorable premise but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
