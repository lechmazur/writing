<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to unite tradition with progress is consistent, but "boldly timid" trait remains abstracted through telling rather than viscerally shown actions; emotional conflicts often stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plotted with elegant symmetry from introduction of key to data revelation, but pivotal transition from suppressed doubt to communal acceptance occurs without sufficient dramatic weight or resistance; pacing uneven near resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere of salt-sweating tunnels and amber-lit databanks creates hauntingly immersive tension between organic mineral decay and technological remnants; sensory details (rattling buses, cracking frescoes) masterfully evoke psychological weight of buried history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative avian metaphors for adaptation resonate thematically, but emotional impact undermined by excessive summary statements ("tears welled", "hope glimmered") rather than character-specific behavioral revelations; ending feels more elegiac than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise strained by occasional purple prose ("shadowed dance of specters," "cacophony of ancestral rhythm") and sudden shifts from ornate metaphor to blunt exposition; bird-formation symbolism remains conceptually rich but execution risks preciousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive mytho-sci-fi parable despite compressed form; while salt-mining history integration feels somewhat schematic, the paradox of progress/conservatism within confined spaces provides enduring thematic resonance.</comment>
