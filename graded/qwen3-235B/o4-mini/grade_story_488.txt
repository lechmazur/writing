<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but motivations remain cryptic; the drive to 'outshine reflection' is thematic but underexplored beyond metaphorical gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows with visceral momentum but coherence suffers slightly; cause-effect between incantation and structural collapse elides logic despite poetic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting merges quantum abstraction with decaying materiality brilliantly; sensory details like 'salt and ozone' and visual contrasts between light/debris create immersive tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ('molten circuitry') and symbolic resonance between invention/decay elevate impact; thematic throughline of rebirth lacks emotional penetration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Balances originality against vague conceptual buzzwords; some phrases ('corroded rapture') feel overworked while others ('nascent inventions') lean generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength lies in synthesizing disparate elements into cohesive dreamscape; ambitions exceed execution in character/thematic depth despite vivid craftsmanship.</comment>
