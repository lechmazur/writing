<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are poetic but underdeveloped; motivations hinted but lack emotional grounding. Interactions with plush and machines show poetic symbolism but not deep internal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Premise drives the plot but suffers from rushed pacing. Connections between dream sequences and resolution are abstract rather than causally logical within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive but emotionally distant; xenon-light and tunnel create mood but rarely connect to character's state or thematic weight of time/sorrow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and thematic unity (fragility/renewal) impress, though over-reliance on adverbial descriptors ("shyly loud") occasionally undermines emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on poetic clich√©s ("weight of countless lost yesterdays"). Dream-hopping device feels derivative; emotional resonance often stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration is competent but not inventive. Style complements theme but occasional purple prose and uneven pacing limit transcendence.</comment>
