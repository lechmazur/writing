<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations implied through metaphor but never coherently dramatized. Heartbreak telegraphs emotional state rather than revealing through specific actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyrical progression exists but lacks concrete narrative stakes; character's transformation occurs through poetic abstraction rather than dramatized cause-and-effect within the compressed word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (damp roots, ink stains, thunderous echoes) create immersive atmosphere. Some elements like "forgotten library" remain underutilized narrative opportunities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors crystallize into thematic resonance; the transformation of water from hidden spring to healing symbol culminates satisfyingly. Emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original conceptual framework undermined by repetitious descriptors ("softly thunderous," "fearful joy") and formulaic sentence structures that risk poetic affectation over authentic revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High stylistic ambition meets uneven execution; core elements form cohesive skeleton, but narrative flow often subsumed by lyrical excesses rather than organically serving the thematic architecture.</comment>
