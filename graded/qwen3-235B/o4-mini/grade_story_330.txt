<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's dejection and vow are clear but lack psychological nuance; motivations persist consistently but remain abstract rather than embodied through specific choices or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous cause-and-effect; surreal progression feels like disconnected tableaux rather than a driven narrative arc. Pacing prioritizes lyricism over momentum, sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vividly immersive setting with synesthetic details; zero-gravity dance hall and sapphire abyss evoke mood through kinetic metaphors like "fractured memories" and "living chords."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich symbolism elevates impact, but emotional resonance feels manufactured through elevated language rather than earned through character vulnerability or clear conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with original imagery but occasionally lapses into excessive ornamentation ("weightless vows" recurred too often); tone remains cohesive but risks overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently integrated; poetic ambition elevates mood but sacrifices narrative urgency and thematic precision crucial for competitive publication.</comment>
