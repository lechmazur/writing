<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but underdimensional; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal conflict. Lacks depth in showing how past experiences shaped his current obsessions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression with poetic vignettes rather than cause-effect narrative; momentum stalls in descriptive passages. Resolution feels abrupt rather than earned despite cohesive imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is immersive; bonsai labyrinth during power outages creates layered atmosphere. Sensory details (glowing moss, rustling twigs) enhance mood and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (mirror as fragmented self, confessions as spiritual cartography). Emotional impact diluted by overdependent abstract phrasing over concrete human moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids recognizable tropes through surreal juxtaposition (bonsai forests as spiritual rivers). No formulaic transitions; language occasionally borders on ornate but maintains stylistic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into haunting whole with deliberate brevity. Leaves lingering questions about spirituality in mundane artifacts; style occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>
