<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters remain static despite vivid detailing; motivation drives plot but lacks psychological depth. Aloofness and curiosity are superficially consistent but lack interior exploration. Dialogue minimal but feels affected, not fully distinguishing voices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through external events rather than character agency. Connections between beginning/middle/end are implied but underdeveloped. Pacing lags in the middle; abrupt hatch descent strains credibility within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine port setting rendered in strong sensory detail, though "wounded season" motif feels decorative rather than thematically integrated. Atmosphere enhances plot but deeper symbolic potential between rusted containers and buried truth remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors involving water/erasure effectively evoke obscured truths. Ending lacks emotional payoff despite thematic closure. Conflicts introduced but not fully dramatized; central idea of reclaimed power needs sharper articulation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on atmospheric descriptors ("murky corridors," "elemental crescendo") that border on convention. Character reasoning occasionally feels overly schematic; some phrases ("briny breaths") verge on preciousness. Submerged secrets conceit remains conventional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but not transcendentally; the logbook serves as both object and narrative engine. Compression effective but themes underbaked. Lingering questions about corporate greed aren't fully weaponized for impact.</comment>
