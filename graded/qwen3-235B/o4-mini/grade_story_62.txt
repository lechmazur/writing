<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract archetype with underdeveloped motivations; his actions rarely demonstrate tangible stakes or personal stakes behind rewriting existence, despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional progression or cause-and-effect; circular structure ("after the final goodbye") creates atmosphere but insufficient narrative momentum within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (blossoms/rot, dripping stones) and symbolic contrast between sewer and amphitheater create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere that deeply enhances the story’s existential tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and subtext about hidden meaning in the mundane elevate the craft, but the story’s lack of emotional urgency or distinct conflict limits its overall impact despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid imagery offsets repetitive abstract phrasing ("humble," "candid deceit"); some passages feel overwritten or contrived rather than organically exploring existential themes through specific, grounded actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion stems from poetic repetition rather than intentional structural design; elements serve tone but occasionally feel like symbolic checklist rather than organically unified narrative.</comment>
