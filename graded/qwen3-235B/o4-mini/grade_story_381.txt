<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters remain enigmatic with vague motivations; traits like necromancy and quietness lack psychological depth, though the baseball cap gesture hints at backstory without full exploration</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coherent but minimal structure - mapping arc clear, but tremor threat resolved too easily without emotional or narrative payoff; pacing lags in midsection despite tight word count</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave rendered with vivid, immersive sensory details that enhance thematic resonance; futuristic nostalgia tone effectively juxtaposes ancient geology with cinematic memories</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphorical potential (film-reel markers, celluloid pulses) undercut by diffuse emotional engagement; theme of cultural memory through cinema is underdeveloped</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (necromantic cartography) and familiar tropes (assistant-muse dynamic); cinematic nostalgia trope feels generically deployed rather than subversively reimagined</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric foundation but uneven narrative integration - elements like "dominate" and "shared love for movies" feel conceptually underexplored despite lush prose</comment>
