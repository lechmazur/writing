<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (tracking butterflies) is clear but underdeveloped. Interactions with the engineer imply depth but lack concrete emotional grounding. The apothecary's "unjustly fair" resolve remains abstract rather than manifesting through specific actions with moral consequences. Repairs of instruments feel tacked on rather than revealing character complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing strains coherence—sudden pivots from map-tracing to fungal experiments to Morse-code romance feel arbitrary within the word limit. The central plot (tracking butterflies) only tenuously connects to the secondary plot (engineer relationship). The resolution involving glowing spores lacks causal buildup, undermining narrative momentum and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is rendered with tactile, sensory immediacy—gears, spores, phosphorescence, and copper speaker create immersive, layered atmosphere. The "battered marvel" tone is consistently evoked through rusted steel and war-torn context. The timeframe ("between broken treaties") effectively shadows the characters' fragile alliances, though underutilized for thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (butterflies as "unlikely cipher of communion") creates emotional weight, but relies too heavily on symbolic substitution rather than earned tension. The central conflict (peace vs. war) lacks visceral stakes within the word limit. Subtext about scientific obsession and suppressed affection is present but thinly sketched. The ending feels poetic but insufficiently earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Language veers toward overwritten poetry ("battered marvel," "haunting glow of luminescent spores") that sometimes reads as checklist-driven worldbuilding rather than organic tone. Metaphors like "infecting the abyss with hope" show ingenuity, but repetitive adverb/adjective stacking ("clandestine kisses," "unlikely confidant") borders on pastiche. The engineer's "tremor in his voice" telegraphs emotion without proper contextual foundation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains surface cohesion through recurring symbols (butterflies, Morse code) and setting motifs, but the brevity forces underdevelopment of both plot and theme. The length serves poetic language well but hinders narrative complexity. The conclusion lingers aesthetically but doesn't probe deeper questions about pacifism, scientific ethics, or love in wartime—leaving more impression than substance.</comment>
