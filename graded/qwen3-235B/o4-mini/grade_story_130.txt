<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations (self-acceptance) drive the story but are stated more than demonstrated through specific actions. Conflicting traits like "mocking affection" lack concrete interaction with plot elements. No dialogue to solidify voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression; transformation feels passive. Beginning-end connection exists (rebirth) but middle lacks tension or cause-effect logic. Reverse-engineering via phone confessions is conceptualized but not dramatized, weakening plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (synthetic pollen, holographic leaves) enhances tone. Interstellar orchard is inventive but underutilized as active narrative pressure; setting feels decorative rather than vital to the character's evolution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (nests, orchards as self-acceptance symbols) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance. Depth in theme (weakness as strength) is present but undercut by abstraction. Ending is thematically satisfying but lacks a visceral emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original setting/subtext but relies on poetic clich√©s ("whispers of doubt," "rebirth"). Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction, weakening specificity. No major AI-like patterns, but emotional nuance lacks layered complexity; tone shifts feel unmoored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story is cohesive on surface, but many elements (interstellar ship, phone) feel poetically assigned rather than organically connected. Creative ambition evident, but thematic execution prioritizes lyricism over narrative momentum. Leaves minimal lingering impact beyond aesthetic appeal.</comment>
