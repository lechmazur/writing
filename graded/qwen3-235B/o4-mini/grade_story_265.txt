<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic with minimal concrete motivation; "impassiveness" is stated but not fully embodied through actions beyond stoic observation. Lacks depth of internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of evocative tableaus but lacks traditional narrative momentum or conflict. Structure is circular rather than progressive, relying on mood over causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through sensory contrasts (oil/dew, stone/vine) and layered metaphors. Setting itself becomes a thematic protagonist, though some elements strain credulity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic craftsmanship evident in symbolic interplay of machinery vs. organic life. The twist tie as fragile order amid chaos is particularly resonant. Emotional impact is diffuse rather than piercing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in cathedral-orchard concept and bee language, but stylistic excess ("unctuous echoes," "amber light") occasionally veers into self-conscious lyricism. Nuanced emotion is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Worldbuilding elevates the piece despite structural looseness. Assigned elements are mostly well-integrated but occasionally function as symbolic props rather than narrative necessities.</comment>
