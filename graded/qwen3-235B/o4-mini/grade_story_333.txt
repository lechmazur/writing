<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's "sincere rebellion" and preservationist motive are clear but lack deeper psychological nuance or evolution. Actions align with traits, but voice feels filtered through abstract atmosphere more than distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear quest structure with coherent cause-effect for the word limit, but the arc feels compressed; the locked arch resolution works, yet pacing could delve deeper into stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp walls, flickering shadows) and braided bitterness tone immerse readers; the "between storms" timeframe enhances urgency, though atmospheric intensity occasionally overshadows plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolism (e.g., whispered curses, pulsing walls) create impact, but themes of tradition vs. erasure remain underexplored. Ending feels resolved yet emotionally muted; tension leans more on setting than character stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rich descriptions border on purple prose; some phrases ("braided bitterness," "whispered curses") recur formulaically. Gothic setting leans on familiar tropes, though the sticky note’s modernity offers a fresh contrast. Emotions are evocative but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a moody, atmospheric narrative, but the brevity limits thematic heft. The story’s resolve leaves lingering questions about Mara’s personal growth or broader implications beyond preservationist defiance.</comment>
