<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her introversion and dancing are superficially referenced without deep integration into her problem-solving or emotional landscape.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but feels rushed in key transitions, particularly the sudden decoding of escape instructions; tension between personal ritual and survival isn't fully capitalized within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through precise sensory details (e.g., "flickering lamp," "howling desert wind") but the cipher decoder's office as a setting lacks contextual connection to the external wasteland.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The metaphorical linkage of knitting/stars creates resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction; ending achieves symbolic closure without earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Possesses innovative conceptual fusion (knitting as celestial cipher) but contains uneven prose quality; some phrases ("echoes of lost civilizations") verge on clich√© while others ("structures woven from stars and steel") demonstrate originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Successfully integrates core elements but lacks narrative boldness; the abbreviated format serves the story well but limits deeper exploration of philosophical implications.</comment>
