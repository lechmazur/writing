<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is layered but underexplored; reincarnation as goldfish caretaker offers rich potential only partially realized through fragmented metaphors and repetitive guilt references. Motivation against tradition is clear but underdeveloped as a psychological force.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prioritizes lyricism over structure—storm as contrived catalyst disrupts pacing, while ritual-subversion arc feels compressed rather than cohesive. Subplots about health and koi pavilion remain unresolved, diluting narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles with sensory fragments (ink jars, golden sunlight on manuscripts) but worldbuilding falters—how does a "recipe library" sustain traditions about literal food vs. metaphoric "flavors"? Inconsistent logic undermines immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strength lies in thematic metaphor (tradition as suffocating recipes, broken toy as reconstruction), but emotional beats rely too heavily on stated feelings ("fear tradition's cage") rather than embodied through action. Ending satisfies but feels facilely optimistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Richly original concept (reincarnated aquatic caretaker in recipe archive) occasionally founders on overwritten prose ("flicking fins of memory," "laughter laced with playful cynicism"). Avoids genre tropes but sometimes substitutes pretension for depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements feel curated like symbolic trinkets rather than organically integrated—doctor’s chart and koi guilt subplot distract from central tradition-rebellion conflict. Style dazzles but can’t fully disguise structural seams.</comment>
