<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's singular motivation (shame) is clear but lacks nuanced psychological depth; actions align with stated goals but persona remains abstract despite poetic descriptions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot uses tight circular structure (radio end to silence) but pacing is occasionally uneven; DNA animation sequence drives action effectively but some cause/effect relationships are implied rather than demonstrated</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in cyberpunk setting with precise details (chipped chrome, holo-ads); atmosphere seamlessly merges with thematic concerns about buried potentials</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (shame as DNA prison) and haunting imagery, though emotional crescendo lacks full payoff; subtext about societal rejection of innovation is potent</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original conceptual fusion of biotech and mythology avoids genre clich√©s but exhibits occasional purple prose ("kaleidoscope of code", "circuitry stillness"); emotional progression feels authentic despite abstract delivery</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Complex thematic integration successfully transcends gimmickry but uneven tonal modulation and conceptual density leave minor fissures in overall cohesion</comment>
