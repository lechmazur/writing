<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (rebelling against illusions) is clear but overly abstract; "honestly strange" trait influences actions superficially but lacks psychological depth; reactions to the churn and poster hint at nostalgia but insufficiently develop inner conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from stagnation to rebellion, but pacing feels compressed; ascending via poster/conduit is inventive but execution glosses over logistical/conceptual hurdles; thematic bookends (crumbling poster to shattered viewport) provide cohesion but lack narrative complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eerie, decaying atmosphere well-rendered through sensory decay (flickering lights, sighing hull); post-ecological-collapse setting shapes tone but underuses the timeframe's thematic potential; butter churn as relic connects thematically but could integrate more viscerally with the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (poster as "fragile wings") and resonant symbols (churn as defiance) elevate the narrative; ending delivers thematic clarity but risks bombast; subtext about truth vs. comfort is clear but emotional impact diluted by abstract prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surrealism (rebellious butter churn) but occasionally slips into ornate, AI-like phrasing ("alien peace in defiance of cosmic apathy"); metaphors feel fresh but some descriptors border on excessive; tone remains consistent but occasionally self-indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly; core theme (rebellion against lies) unifying, but character's "strangeness" and "aloof passion" feel underexplored; brevity serves symbolism over depth; ending provokes thought but lacks visceral punch.</comment>
