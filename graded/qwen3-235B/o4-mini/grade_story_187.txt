<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations inferred through poetic actions but no emotional or psychological complexity. Reactions to objects are symbolic but not viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Meandering structure with no clear arc or conflict. Plot progression relies on abstract imagery over logical cause-effect. Resolution feels imposed, not earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Richly evocative setting with texture and mood; however, worldbuilding overwhelms narrative focus. Sensory details excel but lack integration with character stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength in lyrical prose and subtext about truth/oblivion. Weakness: emotional impact is diffused by overuse of metaphor. Ending is thematic but leaves no tangible resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elaborate style crosses into purple prose. Tropes (ancient ruins, forgotten magic) are clich√©d but slightly elevated by unique phrasing like "brash tenderness."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements forced into service rather than coalescing naturally. The brevity works for poetic tone but undermines narrative substance and cohesion.</comment>
