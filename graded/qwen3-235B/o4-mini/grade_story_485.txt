<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations despite poetic actions; fragmented glimpses of trauma rather than cohesive psychological logic, though the mirrored despair with the genius creates limited emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc undercut by compressed pacing; the charcoal sigils and genius's revitalized work form a clear resolution, but causal threads between social upheaval and specific plot beats remain shallowly implied.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally distant; the drowned laboratory's sensory specifics (coral, waterlogged journals) establish mood effectively, yet societal unrest above feels like atmospheric wallpaper rather than integrated context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical symbolism elevates the narrative (charcoal as salvific defiance), though emotional impact is muted by abstract melancholy outweighing concrete character experience; the ending's "flicker against the dark" lacks visceral urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through metaphorical approach, but suffers from occasionally hollow poetic repetition ("echoes of betrayal") and emotionally distant prose that leans into atmospheric abstraction rather than earned human specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically if not with narrative inevitability; the brevity feels like both an artistic choice and a limitation, leaving conceptual elegance partially unanchored by character/drive.</comment>
