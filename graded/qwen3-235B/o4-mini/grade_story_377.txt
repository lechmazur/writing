<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's actions align with assigned traits but lacks inner depth; digital existentialism hinted but remains underdeveloped. Motivation (digging beyond memory) feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Voice exists but is overshadowed by atmospheric concerns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot advances through surreal cause-effect logic rather than traditional causality. Integration of seismic data spans narrative arc but transitions between library and block parties lack temporal anchoring. Pacing balances mystery with reader fatigue; some connections feel arbitrary (e.g., hopscotch tremors).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Library's drowsy dust and seismograph's "ghostly heartbeats" build tactile unease. Block party details (volleyball twilight, condiment pauses) contrast effectively. Atmospheric consistency falters when technical descriptions overwhelm emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "luminous map rolling across book spines" dazzle, but emotional payoff is intellectual rather than visceral. Subtext of silent stewardship resonates, though character's "electronic fatigue" strains credulity. Ending balances revelation with restraint but feels preordained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("shimmering twilight cheering"). Paragraph-length sentences maintain flow without artificial breaks. Character logic remains plausible within its own rules despite sentience being inconsistently embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion but strain narrative plausibility. Block parties as seismic metaphor is inspired, though the avatar's dual existence in digital and physical realms risks incoherence. Lingering question about the cost of preserved mysteries elevates conceptual depth.</comment>
