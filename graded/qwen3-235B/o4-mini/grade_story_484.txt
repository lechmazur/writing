<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "groggy" trait lacks consistent influence on motivations/actions; transformation feels abrupt without sufficient emotional groundwork, weakening the connection between assigned attribute and behavioral logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence undermined by overly symbolic progression; cause-effect relationship between mirror use and path revelation lacks tangible logic; ending feels emotionally satisfying but structurally shallow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details (shivering tombstones, moonlit shards) masterfully create hauntingly immersive environment; protest's rhythmic intrusion adds temporal urgency that deepens setting's thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical mirror use shows craftsmanship, but emotional resonance limited by excessive abstraction; themes of transformation resonate faintly, weakened by lack of concrete character grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar "shadow vs light" symbolism; protest connection offers modern twist; some generic descriptors ("encroaching darkness") drag toward formulaic territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but unevenly integrated; core concepts (transformation/vision) work well, but specific methods (staircase discoloration) feel arbitrarily chosen rather than organically necessary.</comment>
