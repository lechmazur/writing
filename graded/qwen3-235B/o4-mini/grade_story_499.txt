<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are poetic but shallow; motivation exists without sufficient psychological depth or meaningful conflict driving tangible change.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot is atmospheric vignette over narrative; lacks concrete progression or stakes, though thematic cohesion persists in micro-scale between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is transcendentally rendered with rich, synesthetic detailsâ€”but occasionally overwhelms rather than amplifies narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic resonance present, but emotional payoff is diffuse; ending resonates thematically more than viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ambitious originality undercut by sporadic purple prose and AI-leaning tendencies toward abstract over-concrete language when precision is critical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong conceptual integration of many elements, but sacrifices traditional narrative rigor; succeeds as mood poem more than short story.</comment>
