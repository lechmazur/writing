<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's supernatural ability ties to plot but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel abstract rather than viscerally grounded in specific memories or relationships that justify his emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Preliminary emotional arc exists but feels condensed; symbolic actions lack narrative stakes or concrete consequences; transitions prioritize lyricism over clear cause-effect within limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like "synthetically organic" create artificial immersion; setting juxtapositions (stadium/yodeling valley) feel conceptually forced rather than atmospherically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors carry thematic weight but occasionally overwhelm subtlety; ending's catharsis relies on poetic imagery rather than earned emotional progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual originality exists but is undermined by occasional abstraction-as-substance; some imagery straddles the line between symbolic and self-indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story achieves momentary poetic impact but struggles to fully synthesize its many assigned elements into a cohesive thematic whole; feels more like a fragment than a complete narrative.</comment>
