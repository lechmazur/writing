<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits (rebellion, ancestral duty) are conceptually linked to actions but lack psychological complexity; motivations feel declarative rather than organically demonstrated through choices or conflicts. Internal voice remains abstract, sacrificing human dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has structural integrity (arrival-in-action-exodus) but suffers from compressed pacing. Key moments (tremor, hidden doorway) occur without earned emotional stakes. Logical progression exists but lacks narrative urgency due to underdeveloped stakes and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric synthesis between volcanic setting and magical realism: sensory details (scorched earth/cinnamon aroma, shifting tattoos, magma's light) create a cohesive world where physical and metaphysical elements resonate. Timeframe's poetic abstraction sometimes undermines tangible chronology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyricism and metaphor-rich prose create poetic impact, but emotional resonance suffers from excessive abstraction. Themes of cultural preservation through innovation feel urgent but under-explored. Ending's symbolic resonance exists without sufficient narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Richly imaginative premise undermined by ornate phrasing that occasionally slips into self-indulgent excess. Sensory details show specificity but risk becoming catalogues rather than emotionally activated elements. Original concepts (inked maps on skin) lack deeper conceptual exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story ambitiously combines disparate elements, but their integration feels more decorative than transformative for the narrative. The volcanic setting and ancestral motifs achieve cohesion, while rebellious identity and lost city quests remain conceptually rather than emotionally driven.</comment>
