<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's obsessive motivation clearly ties to cosmic plant study, but lacks depth in emotional nuance and growth; inner turmoil is mentioned rather than shown through specific actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists within constraints, but pacing stumbles during critical transitions like the rapid plant experiments and resolution; cause-effect chain remains intact but rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eerie bioluminescent details create tangible atmosphere, but the lizard people's culture remains underexplored; geothermal springs and phosphorescent pools effectively enhance the story's mystical tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (bitter honey, cosmic resonance) stand out, but emotional impact diluted by abstract summary over concrete actions; the ending bridges science and mysticism satisfyingly despite underdeveloped conflicts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most generic tropes with phosphorescent botany and lizard scholars, but "colliding interests" and shortcut device feel formulaic; language remains purposeful without devolving into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but relies on uneven element integration; lizard people's setting anchors the story while "colliding interests" feel artificially inserted; strong central metaphor partially compensates for scattered subtext.</comment>
