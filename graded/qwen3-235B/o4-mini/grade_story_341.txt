<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's caution and motivation are present but underdeveloped; internal conflicts and growth remain superficial. Actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Limited by word count, but maintains coherence through the rally's arc. Pacing is uneven, with rushed resolution to the artisans' debate and abrupt ending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in the desert fortress and fairs, though atmospheric elements occasionally feel decorative rather than thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (rosary, serpent fortress) elevate the narrative, but emotional resonance is muted by overly expository thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong setting conceals formulaic elements: predictable "unifying object" trope, over-reliance on grand descriptors ("ordered disarray"), and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Competent execution of assigned elements with atmospheric cohesion, but lacks the emotional urgency and narrative risk-taking expected at a prestigious level.</comment>
