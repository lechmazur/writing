<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbol-driven; ambivalence is stated but not deeply demonstrated through specific actions or internal conflict. Motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" lacks emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as a surreal sequence of actions but lacks logical cause-and-effect or clear stakes. The method (jigsaw puzzle edges) introduces abrupt, unexplained shifts that undermine coherence within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Lunar setting is superficially rendered through technical terms rather than immersive sensory details. Atmosphere relies heavily on adjective clusters without concrete texture or purposeful contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("wild truths refusing containment") elevate the prose, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstraction. The ending feels conceptually hollow despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("celestial upheaval," "defragment angular code") verges on self-parody. Conceptual uniqueness is undercut by predictable mysticism tropes and repetitive emotional descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are shoehorned into a symbolic framework without organic integration. The storyâ€™s brevity fails to justify its thematic ambitions, leaving more questions than meaningful engagement.</comment>
