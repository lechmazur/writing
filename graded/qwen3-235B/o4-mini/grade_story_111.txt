<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice and psychological depth despite poetic introspection; motivations are abstractly rendered but insufficiently grounded in tangible actions or backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Plot exists as static ritual tableau with minimal forward momentum; circular structure lacks tension, resolution, or narrative consequence within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (moss, neon shadows) and eerie synesthetic contrasts; setting creates immersive paradox between mundane dog park and alchemical transcendence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose achieves emotional resonance through metaphorical layering ("neon flowers," "exultant grief"); occasionally overwrought but themes of creation/loss remain potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery counteracted by periodic purple prose ("pulse against ribs like living heart") and emotionally opaque abstractions; inventiveness occasionally veers into surrealism-for-its-own-sake.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion compromised by disjointed integration of elements; some inventive combinations undercut by structural imbalance and inconsistent tonal prioritization.</comment>
