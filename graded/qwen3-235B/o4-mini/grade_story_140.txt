<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated; motivations lack depth despite the "tortured" designation. The doll’s role in his past is mentioned but not emotionally explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on poetic transitions rather than logical cause-effect; the connection between the planetarium memory and the climax feels tenuously metaphorical rather than structurally essential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (peeling makeup, tarnished sequins) evoke atmosphere, but cosmic elements clash awkwardly with the circus setting’s grounded decay, diluting coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery (e.g., "dusted ring of stardust") and symbolic resurrection emerge, but emotional weight is undercut by verbose abstractions like "twisting shadows drawn from a child’s daydream."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies on Gothic tropes (abandoned venues, haunted dolls) and verbose descriptors ("whispering hunger") without innovation; the tone oscillates between mythic and overly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing; the brevity strains coherence, leaving threads (e.g., the planetarium encounter) underdeveloped or implausible.</comment>
