<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Main weakness: Scribe’s emotional evolution feels overwritten rather than organically revealed through nuanced behavior; strength lies in how his "rigid protocols" contrast with his eventual physical embrace of the bulb.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength: Coherent throughline from adhesive analysis to bulb’s glow. Weakness: Pacing stumbles during abrupt shift from "heartbeat skipping" to tranquil transformation without sufficient psychological buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of gravestones and greenhouse—moss/mushrooms create biological tension against cold stone, while "whispering" ambiance echoes scribe’s internal conflict between logic and emotion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphor layering (e.g., bulb’s "imperceptible hum" mirroring suppressed emotions). Weakness: Over-reliance on direct statements about transformation rather than dramatizing subtle behavioral changes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (Tesla tech with gothic mysticism) but strained by archetypal elements—witch’s "taste of marvel" slips into cliché, as does raven’s "haunting caw" cueing dramatic beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story transcends element checklist through thematic resonance of innovation requiring vulnerability. Shorter length works as mood piece but lacks narrative muscle—reads like a prologue rather than self-contained work.</comment>
