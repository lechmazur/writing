<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations (regaining power, decoding riddles) are clear and symbolic but lack emotional depth; character serves as a conduit for themes rather than a dynamic entity with nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritual's progression with logical cause-effect but struggles with pacing, feeling rushed in its resolution; story arc is present but sacrifices complexity for atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (moonlight, moss, laughter) create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere, but the goblin city's connection to the necromancer's journey remains superficial and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and imagery elevates the story's craft, but its emotional impact relies heavily on ambiance over character-driven stakes; ending feels poetic but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into ornate prose that distracts from thematic clarity; some phrases feel contrived ("argent luminescence"), undermining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration is mixed—pen and "regain" are essential, while goblin setting and playground sounds feel tangential; story lingers atmospherically but lacks narrative cohesion.</comment>
