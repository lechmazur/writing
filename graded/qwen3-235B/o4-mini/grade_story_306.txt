<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations and quirks remain abstract despite vivid descriptions. "Authentically odd" exists as a tagline without grounding in concrete behavior or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion fractures under chaotic imagery; plot relies on stylistic momentum rather than logical progression. Resolution feels like a collapse rather than earned culmination.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere prioritizes surreal ornamentation over immersive consistency. Sensory details dazzle but fail to anchor the setting’s relationship to the character’s tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overloaded with metaphors that never coalesce into profound subtext. Excessive telling of emotions ("irreverent awe") undermines subtle engagement with themes like ambition’s cost.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on AI-like formulaic transitions and clichéd "mad genius" tropes. Purple prose dominates, with metaphors like "kaleidoscopic fractures of sound" feeling generic rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Burdened by ornate language without structural payoff; assigned elements function as disjointed set pieces rather than integrated narrative drivers.</comment>
