<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character motivation (impossible vow) remains abstract without concrete personal stakes; swordsman's "loving detachment" manifests primarily through aesthetic actions rather than psychological depth, leaving emotional resonance undeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collage assembly drives plot effectively, but ritual resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect logic between scrap sorting and ancient energy activation lacks explicit connections; pacing remains controlled despite structural gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Recycling center setting uses industrial textures (conveyor belts, welding sparks) to contrast mystical ritual elements; neon-lit atmosphere enhances theme of salvaging beauty from decay; sensory details like "ocean breaths" strengthen thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery of collage as map/ritual device offers symbolic weight; emotional impact limited by narrator's overly aestheticized detachment; "playful seriousness" tone feels underexplored in character interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linguistically inventive ("cosmic lovers reunited in metal bins") but occasionally succumbs to ornate phrasing ("liquid syntax" metaphors); character psychology remains schematic rather than nuanced; collage-as-ritual concept shows creativity with minor trope dependency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; elements function thematically but lack organic integration (e.g., secret weavers' role feels arbitrarily convenient); compressed form prioritizes atmosphere over narrative substance.</comment>
