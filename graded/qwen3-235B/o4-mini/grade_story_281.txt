<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Minimal character depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated, and reactions lack psychological nuance. The pickpocket’s transformation relies on abstraction rather than believable behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fractured structure: cause-effect logic is nebulous, thematic resolution feels forced, and the compressed arc collapses under the word limit. Key plot beats appear disconnected or arbitrarily imposed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (rust, steam, light), but setting remains superficial—a backdrop rather than a force shaping character or narrative. Connection to the dummy’s role is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mixed impact: poetic language occasionally stuns but often devolves into pretentious clichés. Themes of transformation are hinted but drowned under excessive metaphor and unearned emotional conclusions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on Gothic tropes (haunted lighthouse, dummy) and AI-era "lyrical" excess. Forced symbolism (dummy as "conduit") and stilted dialogue undermine originality. Sensory details lack specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. The story’s brevity highlights its disjointedness rather than enhancing focus, leaving emotional and thematic weight underdeveloped.</comment>
