<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Monk's motivation (to outsmart dark reflection) is clear, but his character remains more symbolic than fully developed. His actions align with his resolve, yet emotional depth is limited, relying on archetypal traits rather than nuanced human qualities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc from suspense to revelation, but progression leans heavily on metaphorical imagery rather than causally linked events. The ending resolves the immediate goal (returning to the monastery) but lacks narrative complexity within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (wind, frost, flute textures) and mood-anchoring metaphors. The aerial gondola and mist-shrouded peaks reinforce isolation and introspection, though the setting’s symbolic resonance outweighs its practical role in the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Craft excels in poetic imagery and symbolic framing (e.g., flute as vessel for vengeance). The circular structure—beginning/ending with the monk’s resolve—enhances thematic impact. Emotional resonance is implied through subtext, though some abstract phrasing risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality in linking tooth marks to memory analysis, but themes of duality and self-redemption lean on familiar tropes. Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("centuries of doubt"), and the monk’s psychic struggle feels conceptually bold yet emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into the story’s existential framework, though some (e.g., shipping label) feel underexploited. The brevity creates poetic focus rather than limitation, but the narrative’s meditative tone may limit broad accessibility despite its stylistic ambition.</comment>
