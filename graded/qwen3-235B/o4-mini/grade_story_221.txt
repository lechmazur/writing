<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's profession and emotional core are present but lack nuanced development; voice is distinctive yet introspective to a fault, with internal conflict leaning on abstraction rather than concrete actions to illustrate growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc but relies heavily on symbolic gestures; pacing manages the tight word limit well, though key transitions (e.g., sister's voice) feel abrupt, slightly destabilizing the narrative flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details immerse the reader in a hauntingly nostalgic atmosphere; the amber’s warmth contrasts effectively with the cold shadow motif, though some descriptions verge on excessive without deepening the stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber, thawing heart) is evocative; emotional impact lingers through layered metaphors and a resonant ending; occasionally prioritizes lyrical prose over narrative urgency, diluting tension slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining ghostly haunting with carnival decay; avoids clichés through specific imagery (e.g., "condemned laughter"); stylistic flourishes occasionally flirt with overstatement but largely enhance the story’s haunting tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively intertwined with theme, but some (family tradition) feel underexploited; the epistolary structure is purposeful, though the brevity strains character motivation’s complexity, leaving slight narrative gaps.</comment>
