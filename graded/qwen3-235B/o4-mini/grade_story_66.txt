<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherent cyclical arc from fragmented beginning to reconstructed ending, but pacing feels uneven - some poetic passages overshadow plot progression within tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically despite tight constraints; concept drives narrative rather than vice versa; the brevity enhances thematic compression but sacrifices character depth.</comment>
