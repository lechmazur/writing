<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivation implied but lacks concrete stakes or depth beyond stated traits. Actions align with archetype but lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot flows linearly but lacks dramatic tension; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic consistency. Pacing lags during descriptive passages.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through synesthetic details (e.g., "phantom drifts of mist"), but setting occasionally overwhelms narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("bridge between myths and innovation") elevate thematic resonance, but emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strikes balance between originality in merging lighthouse/crossword motifs and clich√© in "rebel scholar" trope. Some purple prose ("joy unfurled quietly") undermines authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements function individually but cohesively, though story leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned emotional payoff. Premise invites reflection but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
