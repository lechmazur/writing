<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks depth in psychological complexity; motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped. The character's actions align with "reclamation" theme but remain symbolic rather than viscerally human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Linear progression with satisfying cyclical structure (forge to rebellion) but underdeveloped causality. Pacing efficient though some plot points feel rushed, particularly aftermath implications.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Richly textured cyberpunk decay effectively contrasts with organic idealism. Timeframe between acts slightly underutilized amidst sensory overload.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive element integration with thematic purposefulness. Prose elevates concept beyond mere setting-piece drama while respecting format constraints.</comment>
