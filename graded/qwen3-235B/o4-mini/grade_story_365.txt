<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Oracle's abstract nature hinders traditional development; motivation is poetic but lacks psychological depth. 'Independently dependent' is stated but not fully dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Non-linear progression prioritizes poetic rhythm over conventional plot mechanics; lacks rising tension but achieves symbolic completion through perfume bottle's metamorphosis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Carnival- subconscious fusion creates haunting ambience; sensory details (rotting fabric, phantom music) perfectly serve metaphysical themes. Atmosphere itself becomes character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful literary devices (rope as temporal lattice, perfume as bottled memory) create multi-layered symbolism. Emotional resonance is diffuse but intellectually provocative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by occasionally mechanical poeticizing. Recurring motifs (braids, perfume) show ingenuity, but 'melancholic glee' phrasing leans clich√©d despite execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere as impressionistic tapestry rather than narrative machine. Surreal compression works thematically but sacrifices visceral engagement with character transformations.</comment>
