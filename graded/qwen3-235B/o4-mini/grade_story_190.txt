<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Arlo’s contradictory traits ("cautious," "meticulously impulsive," "enthusiastic apathy") lack depth or concrete behavioral manifestations; his motivation to "master empathy" feels abstract, not rooted in tangible stakes or psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes substitute for a cohesive plot; the drought-prediction method drives some action but lacks a clear beginning/middle/end arc; pacing is uneven, lingering on poetic imagery at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drought prediction center’s sterile, clinical atmosphere contrasts compellingly with the hallucinatory confessions and butterfly symbol, but worldbuilding remains shallow—no societal context or rules are established.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (butterfly, music, drought) and lyrical prose create haunting emotional resonance; metaphors deepen themes of empathy and fragility, though the ending’s optimism feels slightly underearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by overwrought prose ("symphony of parched confessions") and clichéd motifs; some AI-like repetition in phrasing ("meticulously impulsive") and emotional abstraction, but core idea subverts expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements (butterfly, anesthesia confessions, drought) are woven into a thematically unified whole, but the brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; concept overwhelms character and plot in places.</comment>
