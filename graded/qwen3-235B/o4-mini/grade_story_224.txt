<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape mundanity is consistent, but lacks psychological nuance; traits like "openly private" manifest superficially through brief descriptors rather than lived behavior; reactions to objects feel symbolic but underexplored</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Florid metaphors ("map of distant stars embedded in witchâ€™s secret craft") occasionally cross into purple prose; originality exists in metaphysical meteorite connection but diluted by fantasy tropes (witches, minstrels); emotional beats signaled overtly rather than organically revealed</comment>
