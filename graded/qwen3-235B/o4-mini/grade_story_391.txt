<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character displays surface tension between roguishness and caution but lacks psychological depth; motivations for revolution remain abstract rather than emotionally grounded; minimal character evolution despite narrative arc</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression from solitary musician to revolution but relies on unexplained leaps in logic; cause-effect between driftwood interpretations and consciousness shifts remains vague; pacing uneven in word-limited middle section</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in aquatic environment through bioluminescent visuals and sound metaphors; atmosphere of submerged tension aligns perfectly with revolutionary theme; coral structures function both as decoration and narrative mechanism</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphor of resonant revolution enriched by musical symbolism; ending delivers thematic payoff but lacks emotional catharsis; some passages prioritize poetic abstraction over character-driven stakes</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids obvious tropes through unique underwater context; occasionally slips into lyrical excess that feels self-indulgent; consciousness-encoding driftwood concept shows ingenuity but execution borders on mystical hand-waving</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive whole but with uneven density; brevity enhances mystical elements while constraining character development; creates contemplative mood around revolution mechanics but sacrifices emotional intimacy</comment>
