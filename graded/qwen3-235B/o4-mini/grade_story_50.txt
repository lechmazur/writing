<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Static protagonist; internal conflict lacks evolution. Faith and doubt articulated but not dramatized through decisions. Motivation to become a magic conduit remains abstract, disconnected from concrete desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression. Meandering meditation substitutes for narrative drive. Ambiguous closure avoids resolution rather than achieving it. Timeframe compression feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gorgeous but uneven sensory immersion. Glass desertâ€™s visual grandeur dominates while other senses remain underdeveloped. Atmosphere overshadows functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., monarchs as faith incarnate) undercut by abstract closure. Subtext about solitary devotion resonates, but emotional beats often stated rather than embodied. Central conflict dissolves into lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasionally luminescent but over-reliant on compound adjectives and parallel structure. Originality diluted by spiritually questing lone figure trope. Symbolism borders on overwrought without sufficient anchoring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Visceral imagery and thematic cohesion elevate fragmentary approach. Elements combine inventively but lack friction; story feels curated rather than organically urgent.</comment>
