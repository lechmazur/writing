<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Memory-driven motivation is clear, and the scalpel ties to his trauma history, but inner conflict lacks psychological nuance. The bartender background remains superficially referenced despite lab setting juxtaposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fireworks timeframe creates structural brackets, but crystal-etching progression lacks narrative tension escalation. The arc from memory scraping to pattern revelation feels compressed rather than fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Polychromatic sensory details (quartz prisms, magma lamp) create atmosphere, but the lab's mechanical hissing doesn't connect meaningfully to character's physiological tremors or the "stillness" timeframe.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cutting as both literal act and temporal metaphor works strongly. The fireworks-crystals synchronization provides thematic closure, though some imagery (golden embers) borders on banality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some descriptors border on ornamental (e.g. "scintillating echoes"), but conceptual fusion of marginalia as cosmic cartography avoids genre clich√©s. Fireworks as climactic timing device feels derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively despite occasional schematic quality - the "globalize" directive feels tacked onto personal revelation without addressing how marginal drawings achieve universality narratively.</comment>
