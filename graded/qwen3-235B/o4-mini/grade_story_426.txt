<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to preserve folk medicine is consistent but lacks depth in showing how her prodigy past tangibly shapes her actions; "angrily peaceful" feels stated rather than embodied through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing stumbles between lyrical descriptions and plot progression; the marathon timeframe creates artificial structure, while the ghost train's symbolic role overshadows its narrative function, leaving cause-effect relationships underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere created through synesthetic details (spectral whooshes, thrumming porcelain) merges folkloric and mechanical elements, though the carnival setting remains more symbolic than organically interactive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "petition to ancestors" carry thematic weight, but emotional resonance is undercut by excessive abstraction; the ending's triumph lacks earned catharsis despite intriguing subtext about cultural memory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Unconventional premise is undermined by formulaic phrasing ("bleeding spirit," "whispers of forgotten"), inconsistent sensory precision (simmering decoction vs. vague "spectral mutations"), and mechanical repetition of themes without evolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story hangs together through persistent imagery but lacks rigorous editorial discipline; the tight word limit exposes structural seams where elements feel stacked rather than fused, though the core tension between tradition and modernity lingers.</comment>
