<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's jumping nervousness is stated rather than shown; motivations for idol unmasking lack personal stakes beyond assigned quest; actions feel reactive rather than purposeful; fishhook's function isn't tied to necromantic traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable hero's journey structure; pacing uneven - crucial confrontations feel rushed, while descriptive passages bog momentum; echoes of cause-effect logic but lack emotional weight; lacks distinct arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere contains vivid video game descriptors (chiptune, pixelation), but fails to make retro world feel lived-in or cohesive; sensory details remain cursory; tone oscillates between horror and synthwave without full commitment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Purposeful ending feels artificial rather than earned; metaphors (code corruption, old gods) introduced surface-level themes without depth; relies on "show don't tell" only sporadically; conflict resolution feels algorithmically formulaic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occasional fresh concepts (necromancer-debug hybrid) undermined by overused tropes (false prophets, cursed artifacts); some purple prose ("digital ash"); emotional beats are stated rather than nuanced; style occasionally prioritizes vocabulary over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements superficially serve plot but lack interconnectivity; worldbuilding feels like checklist rather than purposeful design; brief length emphasizes gaps in development; surface themes about simulation vs reality aren't deeply explored.</comment>
