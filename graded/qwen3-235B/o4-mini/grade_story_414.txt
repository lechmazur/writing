<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Poor psychological depth; traits stated but not embodied. Internal doubts fade without meaningful resolution. No distinct narrative voice. Motivation of seeking "art's impact" feels abstracted from human psychology. Reactions to objects lack personal context or emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Disjointed cause-effect between dance class and barricade construction. Pacing lurches between mystical imagery without narrative engine. Arbitrary "arc" ends without earned transformation. Assigned elements (plot-driving action, motivation) exist as decorative set pieces rather than causal forces. Over-reliance on vague symbolic gestures substitutes for structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Visually arresting but hollow setting. Over-embellished phosphorescent descriptions substitute for lived-in reality. Atmospheric elements ("gentle sharpness") inconsistently applied. Lack of tangible laws governing this world undermine tension. Sensory details overwhelm but rarely deepen character or plot. Timeframe motif feels randomly imposed rather than integral environmental layer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some compelling metaphors (art as emotional map) undercut by didacticism. Thematic scaffolding of art's impact exists but remains surface-level. Writing style displays flashes of lyricism amidst self-indulgent abstraction. Central conflict between chaos/art lacks visceral stakes. Memorable images present but emotionally unmooring. Conceptual scaffolding overwhelms character-driven storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stilted transitions between narrative blocks suggest algorithmic stitching. Dance class encounter feels like a stock "change everything" trope without credible developmental logic. Recurring "illusions fade" phrase operates mechanically rather than thematically. Overused poetic abstraction ("luminous burst") dilutes impact. Emotional beats stated rather than demonstrated through integrated action. Predictable contrast of decay/renewal follows genre templates without subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assignments dutifully checked off but awkwardly interlocked. Brief length exposes structural fragility rather than showcasing efficiency. Thematic ambition exceeds execution depth. Writing style oscillates between striking and purple-prosey. Lingering impression is of abstract concept over character-world integration. Demonstrates technical competence but lacks transcendent storytelling logic or emotional gravity.</comment>
