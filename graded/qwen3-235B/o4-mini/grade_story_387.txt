<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character lacks internal conflict or nuanced growth; selflessness is stated but not deeply explored through specific sacrifices or dilemmas. Personality defined by abstract descriptors ('savage grace') without concrete behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between discovery of betrayal and vinyl's redemption feels rushed; resolution occurs conveniently rather than through deliberate pacing. Clear arc but lacks connective tissue between key beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative, sensorily rich setting with recycled spaceship's cosmic atmosphere; underutilizes some elements (e.g., wind chimes' guiding role lacks narrative payoff). Timeframe amplifies melancholy tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery (fractured records as memory vessels) but overreliance on abstract, poetic phrasing weakens emotional immediacy. Central conflict (map corruption) resolved too tidily, undercutting tension. Theme of trust vs greed surfaces late without sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unique cosmic premise avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally succumbs to overwrought phrasing ('interstellar trajectories' brittle with age). Emotional resonance relies partially on stated themes rather than fully embodied character reactions. Voice remains consistent but occasionally veers toward stylization over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully weaves assigned elements into functional narrative, but some components (wind chimes, mark of trust) feel ornamental rather than foundational. Brief length works for poetic vignette but sacrifices deeper character exploration. Lingering thought about sacrifice remains, though underdeveloped.</comment>
