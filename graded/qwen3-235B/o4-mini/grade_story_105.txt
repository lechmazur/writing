<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (proving midnight ends) is consistent but lacks psychological nuance. The "outcast" aspect is hinted but not fully integrated into behaviors or internal conflicts, making the scholar feel more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression (entry → ritual → dawn) but relies on repetitive phrasing ("midnight only lasts so long") to simulate cohesion. The diary method feels abruptly inserted, undermining logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (ozone, trembling rugs) and meaningfully connected to the seashell's symbolism. However, the "witch's flying carpet garage" lacks specificity, blending generic fantasy tropes with less imaginative world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (mirroring, clockless time), layered metaphors, and rhythmic prose create haunting resonance. The ending feels both earned and thematically purposeful, though emotional depth is occasionally subordinated to intellectual motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vocabulary avoids excessive ornamentation but contains some repetitive cadence ("mirrored his...", "midnight..."). The diaries-in-a-restroom device borders on cliché, though the fusion of banal and mystical settings offers subtle ingenuity. Lacks overt "purple prose" but occasionally sacrifices raw emotional immediacy for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are thematically interconnected rather than formulaic, with the seashell and diaries driving both plot and metaphor. Short length creates tension rather than limitation, though the resolution leans slightly on expected "light defeats darkness" simplicity.</comment>
