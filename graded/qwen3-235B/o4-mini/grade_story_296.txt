<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's symbolic motivations are clear but underdeveloped; chopsticks as talismans lack deeper psychological nuance despite thematic alignment with chaos/beauty.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Puzzle-box structure follows cryptic directives logically, but abrupt transitions (hidden conduit discovery, spiral staircase) feel contrived within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Submarine's industrial decay is vividly rendered with sensory precision (rusted glyphs, turbine soundscapes), though setting remains atmospheric rather than interactive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (chopstick/resilience) and visual poetry (spectral currents) linger, but emotional arc stays surface-level; spiritual revelation lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Enigmatic combinations (cookbook cipher, rust glyphs) feel fresh, but phrases like "black ink silence" border on clich√©; thematic consistency outweighs occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Coherent but strained synthesis; elements work individually but narrative feels engineered rather than organically emerged.</comment>
