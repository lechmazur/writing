<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character's "unconventionally rebellious" nature lacks tangible manifestation; motivations remain abstract cosmic ideals rather than relatable human dynamics; assigned attributes feel decorative rather than shaping actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal chain - events hang as disconnected vignettes; the "laundromat meeting" as pivotal action feels arbitrary; no clear arc or resolution emerges in tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Formal beauty overshadows thematic unity; elements like "glimmering transitions" remain hollow; story's bones feel skeletal beneath overwritten surface.</comment>
