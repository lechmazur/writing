<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prince's exile is central but his internal conflict remains underexplored; actions align with motivation, but emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown through distinct voice or layered decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from isolation to connection, but the snowstorm encounter and vault's prophecy feel contrived; pacing balances brevity with resolution, though cause-effect lacks organic tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory immersion in winter and decay; atmosphere perfectly mirrors emotional states, though the "azure salve" glow risks undermining grounded mysticism with abrupt fantasticality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism elevates theme of solitude transformed; some heavy-handed metaphors ("forging strength from solitude") weaken subtext. Ending resonates emotionally despite slight predictability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, original combinations (mortar/parche, exile/herbalist) avoid tropes; language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction ("whispers of history through vibrations") but maintains stylistic coherence and emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements serve theme effectively but unevenly - mortar/loneliness core, while "unseen forces" and timeframe feel tacked on; concise format feels purposeful, lingering with melancholic warmth.</comment>
