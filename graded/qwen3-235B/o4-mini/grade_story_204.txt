<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's profession as cuddler briefly informs action but lacks depth; motivations feel abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Prejudice against mechanical spirits is stated but not fully dramatized through specific memories or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; ceremonial countdown and ticket punch awakening create tension but resolution feels abrupt. Plot relies on vague "unspoken rules" rather than concrete cause/effect relationships within the limited arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in decaying hangar—corrosion, ozone, sparks—but strained connections between atmospheric elements and character psychology. "Ancient novelty" tone inconsistently maintained during emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "pale constellations" offer poetic resonance, but emotional impact diluted by abstract tell-don't-show approach. Theme of overcoming prejudice emerges clearly but lacks layered subtext or surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Purple prose ("neon twilight," "ubiquitous chill") and repetitive descriptors ("echoing," "unspoken") undermine authenticity. Mechanical spirit prejudice feels clichéd without subversion; emotional arc could benefit from sharper specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack synergistic purpose—abandoned spaceport atmosphere outshines character stakes. Length constraints cause thematic underdevelopment despite clever object symbolism and atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
