<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character traits are present but sometimes overshadowed by dense description; motivation to defy expectations is clear yet lacks nuanced emotional grounding in pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flow is generally coherent with a satisfying arc, but the transformation into "stepping onto empty space" feels slightly abrupt despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid visual details create atmosphere, but sensory diversity is limited; gargoyles and abyss contribute mood but lack tactile/auditory depth to fully immerse the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are largely cohesive and thematically aligned, though the brevity occasionally strains the balance between lyrical prose and narrative clarity.</comment>
