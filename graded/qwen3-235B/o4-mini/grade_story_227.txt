<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than fully realized; traits like "drainingly invigorated" and rebelliousness are stated but not organically demonstrated through nuanced behavior or personal stakes. Underdog status lacks concrete backstory or emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague, conceptual "action" of decoding glyphs without tangible consequences; lacks clear progression or meaningful obstacles. The unresolved countdown and lack of temporal grounding undermine narrative cohesion despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie, decaying spaceport atmosphere is vividly textured through sensory fragments ("metal rot," "dust motes dance") and complements the mystical-revolutionary tone. However, worldbuilding feels stylized rather than integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic ambition (quiet revolution, dreams as tools) resonate intellectually, but emotional engagement is hindered by abstraction. Ending gestures at catharsis without earned emotional payoff, leaning on poeticism over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on overwritten metaphors ("phantom voice rasped orders," "coded dreams shimmered") and contrived rhythm between opposing concepts (stasis/action, hope/despair). Tropes recycled without subversive edge; style occasionally overwhelms substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist aesthetically but lack organic synergy; the story's brevity sacrifices character and contextual depth. Conceptually rich but structurally fragile, leaving thematic threads unresolved rather than deliberately ambiguous.</comment>
