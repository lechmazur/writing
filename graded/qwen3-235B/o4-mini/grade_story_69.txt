<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's uncertainty and motivation to forge beauty from chaos are somewhat present but often abstract, with actions occasionally aligning but lacking emotional depth. The connection between the "ties of obligation" and concrete decisions remains vague.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven, leaning into atmosphere over plot progression. The arc from repair shop to library to theater exists but lacks clear stakes or resolution. The "let's improvise with the tin" trigger feels arbitrary, weakening cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Rich but clashing sensory details (holograms + libraries + theaters) create a vivid mood, yet the fusion of futuristic and natural elements feels unearned. The setting occasionally enhances themes but lacks cohesive integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking lyrical prose ("wilting constellations," "jittering screens") elevates the story, but the ephemeral action and lack of character interiority limit emotional resonance. The ending circles back thematically but lacks catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Combines cyberpunk and earthy mysticism innovatively but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction ("anarchic hymn") that risks veering into generic "literary" style. Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on ornate descriptors rather than concrete character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements like the tin and wandering are tightly woven; the library's role as a setting feels tacked on. The vignette structure suits the brevity but sacrifices narrative momentum. The ending lingers thematically but lacks urgency.</comment>
