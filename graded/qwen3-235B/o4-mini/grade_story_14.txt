<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal rather than deeply individualized. Motivation (escaping oblivion) is clear but lacks psychological depth; actions like attempting to "exploit" theories feel under-motivated compared to stated desperation; voice lacks distinctive idiosyncrasies despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a dreamlike progression with clear beginning/middle/end but sacrifices causality for poetic rhythm. Key actions (bargain-making, candle-rescue) feel emotionally disconnected from consequences; pacing uneven - some sections overly compressed, others lingering excessively on atmospheric details.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges industrial decay (tidal station) with mystical undertones. Sensory details like "wax coating his palms" and "ghostly hums" create immersive tension; setting shapes character psychology through oppressive machinery/ocean duality. Timeframe device with candlelit dinners creates effective structural rhythm.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story gains power from metaphorical layering (candle = hope/destruction, tides = fate). Ending's ambiguity rewards engagement, though some phrases ("laughing tears") state emotions rather than dramatize them. Symbolism occasionally overwhelms narrative momentum without sufficient intellectual payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Echoes of gothic/fantasy tropes undercut originality despite unusual elements. Stilted phrases like "jarring unpredictability" feel formulaic; candle motif and tidal metaphors offer freshness but balanced by overripe descriptors ("curious talisman"). Emotional beats show some nuance but often through familiar tragic-gambler templates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually unified but execution uneven. Elements serve both thematic cohesion (candle mold's physical presence) and fragmentation (unhinged professors). Leaves lingering questions about meaning while sacrificing immediate emotional urgency; style occasionally hinders deeper engagement.</comment>
