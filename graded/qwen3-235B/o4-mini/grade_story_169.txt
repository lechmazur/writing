<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation to collect forgotten songs is vaguely connected to core concept of persuasion. Static movements and "grandiose modesty" are stated rather than embodied. Actions align with assigned traits but lack emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot flows through atmospheric vignettes rather than driven action. Choreography as central action creates circular motion rather than progression. Recycling timeframe structure provides closure but lacks narrative tension beyond conceptual framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding shines through sensory alchemy of porcelain arches and steam refractions. Floating tea platform and dusty bottles create cohesive, haunting atmosphere. Tarnished corks and tea memory spaces blend reality/unreality effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story creates lingering mood through poetic metaphors but lacks human emotional resonance. Choreography as persuasion metaphor is clever but remains intellectual rather than visceral. "Silent hymns" imagery memorable but theme underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with original soul-brokering premise but occasionally descends into abstract generalities ("quiet symphony"). Some overused phrases ("whispers on the wind") undercut fresh elements like reversed ink interpretations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story cohesively merges elements into surreal tapestry but feels more like prose poem than narrative. Brevity serves stylistic purpose but sacrifices emotional stakes. Lingering impression is atmospheric rather than transformative.</comment>
