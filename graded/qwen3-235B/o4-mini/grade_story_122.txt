<question>1</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite vivid imagery; motivations (defiance against illusions) hinted but not fully dramatized; actions symbolically consistent but psychological layers lacking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot leans on cyclical symbolism rather than traditional structure; cause-effect logic obscured by poetic abstraction; climax feels abrupt without earned emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Intense visual and sensory textures (cobalt sky, dancing scavengers) immerse reader; atmospheric coherence high, but settingâ€™s deeper mythology remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("scavengers danced over broken bodies") and philosophical themes (safety vs. defiance) resonate; emotional weight diluted by abstract execution and inconsistent pacing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original imagery undercut by repetitive phrasing ("mirage of safety") and overly elaborate syntax; self-consciously poetic style occasionally veers into purple prose without sustained emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>High-concept elements dominate over narrative cohesion; stylish but lacks substantive follow-through on themes; brevity feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
