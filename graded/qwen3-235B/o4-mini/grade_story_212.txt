<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's actions align with stated motivation, but lacks depth beyond surface traits. Internal conflict minimally explored despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Static structure focuses more on imagery than narrative progression. Vague closure lacks concrete emotional or thematic payoff within limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmospheric details (blood-orange sky, enchanted seeds) create a cohesive tone. Sensory immersion slightly overshadows thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and imagery elevate thematic resonance (hope as fragile flame). Over-reliance on descriptive language occasionally dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends mystical elements with post-apocalyptic grit, but familiar phrases ("frail flame") and elevated prose verge on purple prose. Moments of nuance undercut by poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion falters under narrative weight. Conceptual ambition exceeds character depth and plot execution, leaving impressionistic rather than transformative impact.</comment>
