<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract symbolism; motivations implied through poetic gesture rather than psychological depth. No distinct voice in third-person narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional arc; plot structured as cyclical ritual rather than narrative progression. Conceptual coherence overrides dramatic structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting creates immersive atmosphere through sensory-rich descriptions but becomes self-indulgent. Spectral shelves and ash-brown tea provide vivid world-building.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but sometimes substitutes originality with ornate abstraction. Purple prose edges threaten clarity in pursuit of poetic effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements interlocked conceptually but lack narrative grounding. Style overshadows substance; abstract beauty fails to compensate for emotional detachment.</comment>
