<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's forgetfulness lacks narrative integration; motivation to protect shard feels underdeveloped despite clear attribute. Reactions to objects lack emotional depth that would ground their obsession. Dialogue-free interactions limit voice differentiation in third-person perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Negotiation provides structural spine but feels telegraphed; pacing falters with abrupt science fair reference. Pseudo-three-act structure within limit shows skill, but cause-effect between past encounter and present negotiation remains superficial, undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Champagne vault atmosphere offers rich potential, yet sensory details (glowing hues, symphony vibrations) lean on generic lyricism rather than tangible specificity. Timeframe integration through performance echoes is clever but under-exploited as metaphor for historical resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Final wrapping of shard in acid-free cloth offers poignant closure, but deeper themes about preservation vs. discovery remain illustrative rather than interrogated. Subtext about memory and value is present but thinly developed. Show-don't-tell principles unevenly applied in emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Embers of forgotten chapel" and "calm flame" betray cloying metaphor repetition. Cultural clash resolution feels predetermined rather than organically argued. Nuanced moments (curator's softening eyes) contrast with flat declarations of "shared wonder" that suggest formulaic uplift.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element checklist fulfilled with mechanical efficiency rather than inventive necessity. Tight word economy sacrifices character interiority and thematic complexity. Lingering impression centers on setting rather than emotional or philosophical resonance, leaving more sensory than intellectual afterimage.</comment>
