<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear and consistent, but lacks depth in emotional nuance; "bitter laughter" motif recurs without revealing significant layers. Actions align with traits but voice remains stylistically homogenized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from intent to execution with coherent pacing, but lacks a distinct arc; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic continuity. Assigned concepts shape narrative but tension remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile descriptions (crystalline beams, luminous ink pathways) and tone contrasts hope with decay. Sensory details unevenly distributed but overall immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyricism and subtext elevate impact; metaphors (ink as ecological blueprint) deepen themes of cyclical renewal. Ending resonates conceptually but emotional stakes feel abstract. Style enhances rather than obscures purpose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; some phrases ("stardust spores") border on generic. Blends sci-fi and mythos organically, though character psychology remains stylistically flattened.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly to concept, with economy of structure suggesting deliberate brevity. Leverages symbolism over conventional narrative but sacrifices some emotional heft for atmospheric density.</comment>
