<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's resolve and accidental heroism are shown through actions, but lacks emotional depth or backstory to fully realize motivation beyond plot-driven necessities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but feels rushed; cause-and-effect connections (e.g., prophecy dissolution) lack sufficient buildup or payoff within the constrained pacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uncommon combinations (e.g., architectural prophecy) avoid tropes, but dense, occasionally overwrought prose strains toward "meaningful" without fully earning it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but uneven emotional engagement leaves story feeling more atmospheric than fully realized; ambitious but inconsistent in execution.</comment>
