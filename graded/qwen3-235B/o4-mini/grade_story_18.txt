<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Statue’s tragic joy lacks emotional evolution; motivations implied but not deeply explored. Telepathy influences omniscient perspective but isn’t fully grounded in tangible character choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ethereal vignettes lack narrative urgency; "planning" timeframe muddies chronology. Resolution with orphan feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steam motifs and gloom-laced cheerfulness crystallize in vivid, tactile details (whirring gears, frost-kissed lamplight) that permeate physical and emotional landscapes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Calligraphic ink-as-magic and "light of recognition" evoke layered metaphors for truth-seeking. Subtextual tension between permanence/impermanence elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on ornate ("sorrow danced with hope"), but the statue’s telepathic voice maintains distinct introspection. Avoids clichés in favor of steampunk-mythic hybrid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole—mechanical decay vs. human resilience—even if emotional payoff remains diffuse.</comment>
