<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's "fact-minded" trait is inconsistently woven into her emotional-driven actions; motivation to find forgotten places remains abstract without tangible stakes or personal connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks structural cohesion, resembling a fragmented tone poem rather than a narrative; no discernible arc or logic connects the oracle's steps to the ephemeral cathedral or the final threshold crossing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid, surrealistic imagery (collapsing skies, cities carved from longing) but decoupled from character logic; unstable dimension feels stylistically compelling but narratively inert.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("tears become prisms") but undercut by sentimental overload; thematic overlap between empathy and healing remains under-examined, with emotional beats stated rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates with hyper-ornate phrasing ("supernovae of loss") lacking narrative purpose; while not formulaic, some concepts recycle esoteric mysticism tropes without subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cumbersome integration of elements feels like a checklist exercise; prose's relentless abstraction undermines thematic clarity and reader immersion despite flashes of lyrical beauty.</comment>
