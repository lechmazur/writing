<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation ("disarm cynicism") is clear but underdeveloped; the "unruly" alchemist's actions lack psychological complexity, relying on abstract descriptors rather than concrete behavior to convey personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression from experiment to revelation feels static, with underdeveloped cause-effect logic in how the projector display physically transforms skepticism; abrupt resolution lacks earned emotional payoff within constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from vivid sensory details (projector hum, chalk constellations) that enhance mood, though the "between innings" timeframe remains ambiguously connected to the shooting star station setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical use of cracked lens and "touched sky" creates symbolic resonance; poetic language elevates thematic exploration of wonder vs. skepticism, though emotional beats occasionally risk abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Over-reliance on lyrical clich√©s ("twins of pale blues and electric gold") and formulaic tonal contrasts ("hauntingly cheerful") suggest AI-generated flourishes; the core concept's originality is diluted by familiar romanticizing of science.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually ambitious but structurally uneven; elements like the projector method and "between innings" framework strain coherence despite lyrical execution, limiting overall publishable polish.</comment>
