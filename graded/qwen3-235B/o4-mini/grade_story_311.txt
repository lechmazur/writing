<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (reclaiming autonomy) are clear and consistent, but emotional depth remains superficial. The bodyguard's "tense" state is demonstrated through physical descriptions but lacks nuanced inner conflict beyond generalized defiance. Dialogue is minimal and abstract, weakening distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plotted with symbolic coherence (fragments leading to rebellion) but compressed execution feels contrived. Key transitions (e.g., shifting from private contemplation to confrontation) lack sufficient causal scaffolding. The lunar setting influences tone more than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Striking lunar greenhouse imagery contrasts with sterile control, but atmospheric details often serve as decoration rather than thematic reinforcement. Sensory descriptions (hydroponic pumps, synthetic blossoms) effectively juxtapose artificiality against human longing, though inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (photograph as rebirth talisman, stolen fragments as seeds) provide strong symbolic architecture. The theme of quiet revolution resonates through subdued yet precise language. Emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction and lack of visceral character engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar rebellion tropes with lunar-futurism veneer. Prose occasionally becomes overly ornate ("timely rebirth entwine with every pulse of engineered air") while key emotional beats default to telling ("realized identity had been ratified by others"). Subtler handling needed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate structurally but not organically - lunar setting drives atmosphere rather than narrative urgency. The brevity works as stylistic constraint rather than strength. Leaves thematic impressions but lacks emotional gut-punch from uneven investment in character interiority.</comment>
