<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond symbolic function; motivation clear but underdeveloped. No distinct voice in third-person narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but feels abstracted rather than earned. Plot mechanics hinge on metaphorical actions rather than concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, but tone occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity through excessive sensory overload.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate the story, but emotional impact is diffused by over-reliance on abstraction rather than human resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept and style, but borderlines on purple prose. Occasional clich√©d phrasing ("whispers echoing secrets") and overly ornate descriptions undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere minimally through theme rather than narrative necessity. Feels curated for poetic effect over organic storytelling logic.</comment>
