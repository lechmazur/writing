<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is primarily symbolic; motivations are implied through artifacts and actions but lack depth or inner conflict beyond surface melancholy. No distinct voice or personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Linear progression exists, but lacks developed arc or stakes. Plot relies on static atmosphere over cause/effect momentum, feeling more like vignette than complete narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse reader; setting and tone intertwine effectively to evoke guilt and solitude. Atmosphere outweighs plot development but remains potent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbols like items and mirror generate lingering questions, but emotional payoff remains abstract. Lacks concrete thematic payoff despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrases ("joyful agony," "bitter honey") border on clich√©, but metaphors like "labyrinth of guilt" feel fresher. Avoids predictable tropes in favor of surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but lack individual necessity. Style overshadows substance; poetic language elevates mood but weakens narrative urgency.</comment>
