<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Contrasts between nervous kingpin's illicit authority and nurturing mission create tension, but motivations remain partly opaque. Actions align with resistance against indifference but lack personal stakes beyond abstract 'fragile ferocity.'</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Midwinter journey to clandestine greenhouse provides structural cohesion, though sudden detour feels slightly contrived. The contained mission allows satisfying micro-arc within constraints, with planting action serving as narrative apex.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Oppressive xenophobic enclave rendered through razor-sharp sensory details (shattered glass, steel-cold air) masterfully externalizes psychological climate. Midwinter setting becomes active antagonist through environmental challenges and symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Merging criminal undercurrents with ecological hope creates haunting juxtaposition. Metaphors (seeds vs tyranny of indifference) resonate through disciplined 'showing' rather than telling. Ending maintains tension between despair and tentative hope with poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through noir-inflected horticultural rebellion, though 'fragile ferocity' risks becoming a crutch. Some phrases ('whispering seedlings') border on sentimental, but stark imagery grounds the allegory in physical reality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements intertwine organically: kingpin's duality motivates covert gardening, xenophobic setting necessitates secrecy, midwinter challenges amplify stakes. Narrative economy reveals depth through precise symbolic layering rather than exposition.</comment>
