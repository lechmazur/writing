<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority and evolving motivation; motivations are stated conceptually rather than demonstrated through nuanced choices. "Spirit guardian" remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but resolution feels rushed and overly symbolic without earned emotional payoff. Timeframe compression creates coherence but obscures narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges sensory details (neon pulses, cornflower light) with thematic abstractions. Setting becomes character through palpable textures of defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery-laden prose creates emotional resonance but occasionally prioritizes metaphor over genuine character agency. Conceptual themes transcend surface plot while relying on familiar hope-vs-cynicism dichotomy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes border on purple prose; some tropes (cynicism vs. hope) feel retreaded. Unique element combination (DVD/projector symbology) shows ingenuity within formulaic rebellion framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cohesive in execution but superficial in emotional depth. Style supports mood more than narrative substance. Lingering impression is more aesthetic than transformative.</comment>
