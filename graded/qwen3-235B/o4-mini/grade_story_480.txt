<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are atmospheric but lack depth; motivation (reigniting curiosity) is repetitive without emotional grounding. The "indifferent enthusiasm" feels like a placeholder, not a lived-in motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on aesthetic ambiance over narrative drive. Connections between beginning and end are vague; pacing drags in mid-sections. The action lacks sustained tension or logical progression beyond mood.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and immersive—sensory details like "peeling paint" and "neon halos" create a haunting atmosphere. Atmosphere aligns with tone, but deeper integration with plot logic is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses vivid metaphors (e.g., "digital séance") and layered imagery, but emotional impact is diffused. The ending is conceptually satisfying but lacks narrative urgency or thematic revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on florid phrasing ("quietly loud tapestry") that feels stylized over substantive. Subtext and theme are present but underdeveloped; tension leans on ambiance, not organic conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a cohesive aesthetic but lack narrative cohesion. The short length limits emotional engagement, though the atmospheric focus feels intentional. Conceptual ambition outpaces structural execution.</comment>
