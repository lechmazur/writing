<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Limited character depth due to word count, but key moments hint at guarded vulnerability and shared longing for connection. Child's personality feels underdeveloped beyond archetypal "wisdom."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Compact structure with clear progression from guarded secrecy to shared revelation, but lacks meaningful conflict and resolution feels abrupt without emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Striking visual concepts (neon rain, bioluminescent fruit) establish mood, but deeper integration of cyberpunk elements with thematic concerns remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and symbolic resonance between technology/nature show craft, but "quiet revolution" trope weakens emotional authenticity through overfamiliarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mix of original imagery ("pollen-glow motes") and shopworn cyberpunk tropes creates mixed impact. Emotional cadence occasionally feels algorithmically optimized rather than organically nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic synthesis of technology/nature, isolation/connection works within limitations, but narrative lacks sufficient emotional stakes and psychological complexity for prestige publication.</comment>
