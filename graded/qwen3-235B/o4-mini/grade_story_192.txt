<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation of digital-age connection is clear but lacks complexity; "ruthless kindness" shapes actions but isn't fully interrogated emotionally; reactions to objects/methods remain consistent yet underdeveloped in inner conflict</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from restoration to resolution, but the breakneck pacing (ghost appeasement progression) feels rushed; cause-effect relationships established but lack tension; beginning/end connection exists but lacks visceral payoff</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends decay and renewal effectively though sensory details often skim surfaces (e.g., "spectral sighs" lacks physicality); setting's hybrid identity as museum/haunted space needs deeper exploration</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery of stitching as emotional metaphor resonates; theme of human connection through labor offers depth; some telling (e.g., "organic faith") undercuts nuanced show-don't-tell moments in ghost interactions</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique fusion of conservation and supernatural, but "technically organic" concept borders on jargon; stylistic flourishes mostly enhance but occasionally devolve into abstraction ("emotional architecture")</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative coherence but some feel perfunctory (e.g., poltergeist analysis method lacks procedural depth); theme of connection resonates but execution remains conceptually safe; style occasionally obscures emotional immediacy</comment>
