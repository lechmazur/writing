<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's arrogance and doubt are established but underdeveloped; internal conflict is stated rather than fully dramatized through specific actions or decisions beyond posture and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ritual arc with cause-effect coherence, but the pivotal "authorize" moment lacks emotional weight buildup; pacing feels slightly rushed in character transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evoke ink-stained courtyard and ritual atmosphere successfully, but sensory details occasionally veer into generic "Eastern mysticism" tropes; bamboo and ink symbolism could be more contextually specific.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., "corridor between fear and hope") and thematic resonance about humility, but over-reliance on abstract adjectives ("harsh tenderness") dilutes emotional immediacy; some "telling" weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unique fusion of calligraphy/wedding song rituals stands out, but familiar "redemption through ritual" structure and ornate descriptions sometimes border on self-indulgent; emotional beats feel slightly algorithmically patterned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are technically integrated but occasionally utilitarian; brief length works but sacrifices deeper exploration; atmosphere lingers, though thematic depth feels surface-level.</comment>
