<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character serves as vessel for theme; motivations implied through actions but lack nuanced internal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear ritual-arc structure with cause-effect pacing, but abrupt cosmic shifts lack contextual buildup within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere through tactile details (cedar, sigils, charged air) but magnetic field's narrative role remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (cosmic gears, polymerization) intrigue but over-adorned prose occasionally muffles emotional resonance; theme of inherited trauma remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Attempts to subvert tropes (e.g., sigils as "discreetly flagrant") but lapses into ornate abstraction; some emotional states stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements fit cosmetically; the ritual's mechanics strain credibility despite atmospheric cohesion; concise format prioritizes mood over depth.</comment>
