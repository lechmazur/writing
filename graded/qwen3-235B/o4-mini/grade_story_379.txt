<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character driven by plot elements rather than fully realized motivations; "trickster" and "lawyer" traits underexploited despite thematic use of lost friends and linguistic mission</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tight word limit strains plot coherence; cryptic dares propel action but narrative connections between biodome obstacles feel rushed despite logical cause-effect structure</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements serve story through metaphorical connections; short length amplifies tension but insufficiently develops trickster persona and rival dynamics</comment>
