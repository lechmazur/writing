<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation (solving labyrinth) is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth; "voice" remains diffuse despite poetic narration</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overloaded with dazzling concepts that overpower emotional grounding; cohesion compromised by density of abstract motifs</comment>
