<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character exists wholly as symbolic construct; lacks interiority, emotional complexity, or evolved motivation. Actions and traits remain abstractly imposed rather than organically demonstrated through behavior or choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot operates as undifferentiated stream of atmospheric gestures; contains ritualistic progression but lacks defined beginning/middle/end structure. Action remains static due to absence of tangible stakes or transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as hyper-sensory extension of thematic concerns; nectar facility's alchemical grandeur and temporal liminality rendered with synesthetic precision to justify its own existence beyond checklist element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose possesses undeniable literary muscle through dense metaphorical embroidery and rhythmic cadences, but sacrifices human-scale emotional consequence in favor of mythic abstraction. Endgame's cosmic transcendence feels conceptually hollow for lacking identifiable cost.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality evident in grotesque-meets-cosmic hybridity, but undermined by tendency toward compulsive adornment - too many images fighting for dominance. Sensory details sometimes feel like AI's aesthetic defaults rather than authorially curated choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Exquisite momentary textural pleasures undercut by fundamental narrative opacity; the components cohere at surface level but lack unifying philosophical gravity. Style sustains interest better than substance, but remains unmoored from urgent human (or post-human) meaning.</comment>
