<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (escape from Death) are clear but development remains surface-level; internal conflict between tradition and rebellion hinted at but underexplored in brief narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tightly paced within constraints, though resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between ritual disruption and escape logical but lacking emotional payoff for stakes introduced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create immersive, mythic atmosphere; setting as active character through trembling earth and symbolic hourglass, though tectonic edge specificity underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical language and subtext about tradition vs. freedom resonate, but occasional overwritten phrases ("lightning forks painted dusk") dilute impact; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks visceral emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Subverts ritual/escape tropes with picnics and brass doorplates but occasionally lapses into abstract descriptors ("melancholic glee"); emotional stakes feel slightly generic despite imaginative concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious combination of elements creates lingering intrigue, but brevity hinders deeper thematic exploration; cohesive but slightly unbalanced between poetic abstraction and narrative clarity.</comment>
