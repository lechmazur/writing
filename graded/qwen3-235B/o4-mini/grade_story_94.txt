<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like femme fatale allure and restlessness are present but remain abstractly poetic rather than psychologically concrete, relying on metaphor over behavioral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc of self-liberation but feels compressed and episodic; transitions between counseling scenes and personal revelation lack causal momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Visionary imagery (floating clinic, temporal water reflections) creates mood, but lacks tactile, grounded sensory details to fully immerse readers in the world's logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (cloud-trail sorrow mapping, shattered illusions) enhance theme, but emotional impact is diluted by heavily stylized prose that prioritizes poeticism over human resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Originality stifled by AI-trope warning signs: excessive abstract/flowery phrasing (e.g., "molten metal against ribs"), overly wrought similes, and conceptual vagueness that feels generative rather than authorial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story assembles assigned elements cohesively but superficially; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with themes and emotional beats underdeveloped.</comment>
