<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character lacks individuality, emotional grounding, or distinct voice; motivation exists abstractly but isn't concretely tied to tangible internal/external stakes beyond conceptual resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists formally but lacks dramatic tension or cause/effect momentum; pacing feels deliberate yet static, avoiding conflict escalation despite poetic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere achieved through sensory details but leans overly reliant on mood over functional setting integration; setting remains evocative backdrop rather than active participant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality evident in conceptual framework but risks excessive ornamental prose; avoids clich√©s yet occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over nuanced emotional authenticity or structural innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially with atmospheric precision but lack transcendent thematic/emotional synthesis; style elevates text but insufficient narrative or character-driven depth for publishable distinction.</comment>
