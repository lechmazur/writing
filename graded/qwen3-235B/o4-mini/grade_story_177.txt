<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's rebellious trait and role as obituary writer are thematic but lack psychological depth or evolution; motivations stated more than demonstrated through actions. Mask's reaction to choices superficially indicates internal conflict without full integration into narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has poetic cohesion but lacks clear progression from individual choice to revolution's larger stakes. Pacing uneven: excessive focus on sensory details conflicts with word-limit urgency. Cause-effect between organ playing and bookshelf trembling feels symbolic rather than narratively earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully combines claustrophobic tension with cosmic scale through vivid tactile descriptions (varnished wood, trembling shelves). Revolution's murmurs and spectral organ chamber create oppressive yet transformative environment that deeply supports thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (books as fates, music as defiance) and resonant imagery creates emotional/philosophical impact. Ending feels thematically earned though plot arc remains abstract. Subtext about art's redemptive power emerges clearly through layered symbolic action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some phrases ("dizzying maze," "lucid frenzy") border on clich√© despite fresh central conceits. Occasional purple prose ("heartbeats echoed like drums") disrupts otherwise distinctive style. Conceptual originality elevated by unexpected combinations but execution occasionally formulaic in emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story maintains aesthetic unity through meticulously woven symbolism, though thematic density occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity. Elements (traveler's profession, mask, organ) feel purposefully integrated rather than arbitrary, creating lingering resonance about artistic resistance against deterministic systems.</comment>
