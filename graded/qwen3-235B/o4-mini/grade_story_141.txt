<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Superstition drives actions but lacks psychological depth; motivation feels implied rather than demonstrated through conflict or internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a mystical journey arc but rushes transitions (e.g., scavenger hunt to prophecy); cause-effect connections exist but lack emotional weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration feels calculated rather than organic; atmospheric cohesion partially compensates for structural rigidity in tight narrative space.</comment>
