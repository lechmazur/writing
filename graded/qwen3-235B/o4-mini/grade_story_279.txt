<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; "parched" serves only as surface descriptor. Motivation remains abstract, with no psychological nuance or personal stakes beyond the stated task.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through actions but lacks narrative purpose. Causal links between scenes are hazy; climax (finding atlas) feels abrupt, not earned through prior setup or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually immersive with vivid sensory details (e.g., "phosphorescent script"), but the "giant's book" setting remains conceptually underutilized despite strong atmospheric execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overshadow thematic substance. Metaphors like "living neuron network" intrigue but aren't connected to deeper ideas about knowledge preservation or human resilience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mix of fresh (giant's book) and clich√©d elements ("tactically reckless") undermines originality. Prose veers between lyrical precision and generic descriptions ("electric peace" overused without justification).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven. Stylistic ambition is evident, but the story sacrifices cohesive theme development for ornate description. Leaves impression but no lingering resonance.</comment>
