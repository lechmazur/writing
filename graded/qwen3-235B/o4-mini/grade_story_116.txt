<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivations feel thematic rather than psychologically grounded. Minimal emotional resonance despite poetic gestures. Voice lacks distinctiveness in a first-person perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pseudo-arc ends where it begins, but lacks causal momentum. Plot fragments driven by conceptual actions (e.g., studying photos) lack concrete stakes or progression. Coherence sacrificed for atmospheric flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rich but superficial sensory details (velvet skies, shimmering embers) create mood without emotional payoff. Worldbuilding feels decorative, disconnected from character’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (time’s debris, maps from memory) elevate style, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. Ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral punch. Theme of boundaries is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally veers into mannerism (e.g., “endless dark above”). Avoids clichés but risks pretension with overwrought phrases like “veins of silver moonlight.” Nuanced emotion is stated, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements are ornamental rather than cohesively integrated. Style over substance; poetic flourishes outweigh narrative urgency. Premise promises depth but settles for atmospheric ambiguity.</comment>
