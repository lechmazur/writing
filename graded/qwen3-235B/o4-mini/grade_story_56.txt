<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits are inconsistently applied; Mara's transition from lethargic swindler to determined truth-seeker lacks sufficient psychological nuance. The blank price tag (object) poorly connects to her stated motivation. Emotional shifts feel abrupt rather than organically earned through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence struggles under tight word limits: the meetup feels contrived, data reveal lacks technical specificity, and revolutionary implications emerge without buildup. Despite rushed pacing, the frozen computer's restart effectively bookends the narrative with circular precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking but inconsistent setting juxtaposes decay and renewal through rusted girders amid budding fruit. Sensory details like fanning book pages and humming wires create vivid contrasts, though the post-apocalyptic aesthetic occasionally veers into overwrought metaphor without purposeful restraint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (priceless truth, magnetized warmth) elevates thematic resonance. The final act's collision between personal reckoning and corporate accountability creates emotional gravity. Some telling weakens showing, particularly with Mara's internal state transitions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Struggles with uneven prose: "dangling price tag heavy with unintended possibility" feels strained; "invisible allies" leans on mystical abstraction rather than human uncertainty. Tropes like meet-cutes in ruins and triumphant data uploads require more subversion to avoid clich√© frameworks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements form a serviceable whole: the setting creates momentum, the price tag symbolizes themes, and the revolutionary arc gains traction. However, brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of Mara's swindler past and the allies' nature, leaving conceptual scaffolding visible.</comment>
