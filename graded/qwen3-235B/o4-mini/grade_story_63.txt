<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is consistent in reserved humility and motivation to preserve art, but lacks depth beyond symbolic role. Actions align with traits, but no emotional complexity or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has cyclical structure with resolution tying to choir's crescendo, but lacks dynamic progression. Concepts drive static vignette rather than urgent narrative arc within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion through decayed settings and resonant metaphors enhances both character and theme. Atmosphere serves as active backdrop rather than passive setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Crafted imagery and symbolic ripple effect invite reflection, but emotional impact remains subdued. Theme of preservation is clear, though "showing" occasionally lapses into ornamental description.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Language risks purple prose with dense metaphors, but unique conceptual fusion (acoustic archeology) avoids total formulaicity. Character psychology feels distilled rather than mechanically logical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Skillfully woven thematics and cohesive setting elevate functional element integration. Stylistic ambition occasionally impedes clarity, but brief form serves meditative tone rather than feeling restrictive.</comment>
