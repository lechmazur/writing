<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has vague motivation and inconsistent depth; inner conflict hinted but not fully embodied through actions. Scars and lineage mentioned but their weight underdeveloped. Transformation too abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>No clear narrative arc; relies on poetic vignettes over structure. Pacing deliberate but connections between elements (e.g., virtual calls vs. vigilante duty) underexplored. Ends without resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere with rusted walls and fractured light. Strong tactile details like trembling fingertips on the bead. Virtual calls clash tonally with "screaming silence," disrupting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mirror as metaphor for mastery/sacrifice resonates. Subtext about transforming war trauma into discipline offers depth. Ending’s symbolic stillness effective but emotional stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Blends modern and ancient elements inventively. Overuses abstract descriptors ("artfully clumsy") and risks clichés with "silent streets," "turbulent soul." Conceptual layering strong despite minor redundancies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly. The bead and mirror enhance symbolism; virtual calls feel shoehorned. Strong visuals counteract occasional prose flatness. Lingers slightly but lacks punch.</comment>
