<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Internal conflict is evident through visceral details and symbolic objects, but deeper psychological exploration is limited by brevity; motivation remains consistent yet underdeveloped in its emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing occasionally strains under dense imagery; logical progression maintained despite compressed arcs and high-stakes execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory textures immerse readers, though "functionally rare" crystals lack functional integration; setting's sonic motifs strengthen atmosphere more effectively than spatial coherence.</comment>
