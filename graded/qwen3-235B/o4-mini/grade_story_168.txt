<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's ruthlessness and spontaneity are abstractly stated but insufficiently demonstrated through concrete actions; motivation via "watcher's burden" is vaguely mystical rather than coherently psychological. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Circular structure lacks narrative momentum; time jumps between tavern memory and stone circle feel disjointed; "decoding rock art" lacks clear stakes or consequences within the limited scope. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ethereal stone circle atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently anchored to sensory specifics; the "pause between verses" timeframe creates poetic tension but isn't fully integrated with the main action's rhythm.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose creates haunting imagery but relies too heavily on abstraction; themes of artistic/archaeological obsession resonate, though emotional engagement is undermined by narratorial distance and overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Concept is original but execution leans on lyrical clich√©s about art/science convergence; character's "intellectual spontaneity" manifests as erratic sentence structures rather than distinct cognitive patterns; avoids purple prose but risks clinical detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story's elements function as literary puzzle pieces rather than organic components; length feels constraining rather than purposeful; thematic ambition outweighs achieved cohesion, leaving conceptual residue without narrative completion. </comment>
