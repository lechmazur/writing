<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Motivation exists but lacks depth; obsession stated, not earned. No internal conflict shown. Actions consistent but one-dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Simple structure but lacks development. Pacing uneven—introduction and climax abrupt. No meaningful resolution beyond acquiring the fragment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on tropes (dust, cobwebs, flickering candles). Sensory details present but generic; setting and object connection superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Overuse of clichéd metaphors ("fruit of knowledge," "air thickened"). Attempts at lyrical prose undercut by redundancy. Ending lacks thematic resonance or surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing ("whispered methods," "reckless delight"). Tropes (forbidden knowledge, cursed artifacts) unchallenged. Prose veers into purple patches without emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elements included but minimally integrated. Tone inconsistent—self-serious yet lacks thematic weight. Overly ornate language distracts from substance.</comment>
