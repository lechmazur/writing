<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's traits (stage fright, inheritance of lies) are woven into her actions but lack layered emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than embodied through fully realized choices or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cleanse-and-exorcise action drives the plot, but pacing stumbles slightly due to compressed backstory; the orbital threat resolution feels abrupt despite strong thematic bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Richly layered sensory contrasts (space debris’ coldness vs. organic wildflowers) enhance the eerie, claustrophobic tone; setting and concept are tightly fused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and ritualistic prose create resonance, but thematic clarity wavers—subtext about inherited falsehoods lacks concrete embodiment in plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with inventive blends of tech/spirituality, but occasional overwrought phrasing (“fragile mosaics”) and underexplored emotional beats lean toward AI-like abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and ambitious, though the story’s brevity sacrifices some character nuance; the toy-assemblage motif and defiant tone linger memorably despite uneven pacing.</comment>
