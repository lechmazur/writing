<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to pursue forgotten languages through storms is consistent, but lacks emotional depth or relatable inner conflict. Actions are symbolic but limited by abstract portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (arrival, activation of button, revelation) but pacing feels uneven. Cause-effect relationships hinge on poetic abstraction, risking narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (storm visuals, control room sensory details) but occasionally overwhelmed by ornate description rather than grounded immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (imagery, paradoxical “timidly loud”) elevate style, but emotional impact is diluted by prioritizing aesthetics over human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of myth and meteorology avoids clichés. While some phrasing borders on purple prose, the story’s ingenuity in blending esoteric concepts is striking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically cohesive whole, though the brevity leans on poetic shorthand. Leaves a lingering impression of curiosity and transformation.</comment>
