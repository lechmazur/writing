<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Death wish is stated but not emotionally internalized; character remains more symbolic than psychologically vivid, motivations feel abstractly assigned rather than organically earned through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot momentum exists but relies on surreal juxtapositions rather than coherent cause-and-effect; talk-radio psychic method feels disconnected from energy mapping resolution, undermining logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting with crystalline and aqueous imagery; however, the talk-radio device jars with the mythological atmosphere, creating tonal dissonance between modernity and ancient ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Creative premise with subterranean energy cartography but veers into purple prose excess; talk-radio psychics feels like an AI-generated dissonant element undermining originality's credibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Gorgeous atmospheric fragments don't cohere into a unified narrative; many elements feel like beautifully ornate puzzle pieces placed into mismatched slots by an external design.</comment>
