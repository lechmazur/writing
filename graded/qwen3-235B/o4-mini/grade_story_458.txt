<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character is a symbolic figure without psychological depth; motivations are poetic but lack personal history or contradictions. Rituals (coat button, coffee reading) hint at devotion but feel more allegorical than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on static contemplation rather than cause-effect progression; the "yes or no" moment lacks narrative weight despite thematic repetition. Pacing lingers on imagery at the expense of forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dusty tomes, humming shuttles) create haunting atmosphere. Abandoned spaceport's tactile decay contrasts effectively with digital erasure, though worldbuilding feels stylized over structural.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Aesthetic richness (fractal sorrow, bridge metaphors) elevates themes, but emotional impact is diffused by abstract lyricism. The flying library as a "node in the bridge" concept is conceptually striking if overstated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dense metaphors verge on purple prose ("blotch on porcelain mirrored fractal sorrow"). Sensory details impressive yet recurring phrases ("fading tradition," "fractal sorrow") undercut originality. Emotional beats feel curated rather than lived-in.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements fit thematically but lack functional cohesion; tone dominates over narrative urgency. The story is visually and conceptually memorable but struggles to balance lyrical abstraction with emotional immediacy.</comment>
