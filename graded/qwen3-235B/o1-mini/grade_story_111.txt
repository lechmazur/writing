<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's theoretical intuition lacks tangible connection to actions; motivation stated more than demonstrated through behavior; introspective tone dominates but development remains static.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on symbolic action (stone into pond) with minimal forward motion; thematic arc exists but lacks narrative tension; beginning and end mirror without sufficient progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Moody, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (moss, fog, moonlight); setting enhances the solitude and existential tone, though "brewing" timeframe remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (pond patterns, golden ribbon) and poetic language; emotional impact is subtle but risks being diffuse; theme of reconciling faith with doubt is clear but underlayered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some evocative phrasing ("exultant grief," "concentric rings") but leans on abstract descriptors; metaphors fresh yet occasionally repetitive; tone shifts between lush and opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not innovatively fused; constrained length limits depth; atmospheric precision elevates cohesion, but story feels like a polished vignette rather than transcendent narrative.</comment>
