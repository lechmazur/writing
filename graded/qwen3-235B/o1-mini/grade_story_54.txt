<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's even-temperedness contradicts rebelliousness without sufficient nuance; motivations to preserve hunting techniques lack concrete emotional grounding despite symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot leans on atmospheric tension over coherent progression; cause/effect blurred between star patterns and smuggling actions within tight word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in decayed carnival atmosphere, though vibrations of intent and regretful letter feel tacked onto setting rather than integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant celestial metaphors and thematic tension between tradition/progress elevate impact, but emotional resonance remains surface-level due to sparse character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("whispers of intent vibrations") and underdeveloped rebelliousness suggest formulaic writing, though atmospheric originality partially redeems style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive tone and symbolic elements compensate for uneven thematic integration; ending feels intentional but lacks narrative gravity within constrained scope.</comment>
