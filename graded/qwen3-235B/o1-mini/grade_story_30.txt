<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits are surface-level; motivations lack emotional grounding despite connections to legacy. Actions feel symbolic but not psychologically coherent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as disconnected vignettes; cause/reaction between elements (dice rolls decoding languages) feels arbitrary. No real arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere has intriguing juxtapositions (dragons/tech), but sensory details are sporadic. Sacred disorder concept fails to fully materialize spatially.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Hollow metaphors (dice=trees=language); attempts at thematic resonance collapse under lack of character/narrative substance. Ending feels tacked-on.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on space pirate/farming hybrid trope without innovation. Purple prose abounds ("sacred disorder"). Emotional beats are explicatory, not experiential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist boxes rather than organic components. Short form doesn't excuse shallow execution; thematically ambitious but technically failed.</comment>
