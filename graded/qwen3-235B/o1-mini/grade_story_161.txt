<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's vigilance and grief are present but underexplored; motivation for conspiracy pursuit relies on vague "heirloom" backstory, while sardonic tone feels artificially imposed rather than naturally embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on arbitrary connections (peacock tails to paper planes) with insufficient causality; compressed arc from seal investigation to conspiracy takedown feels rushed, undermining emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Paper airplane facility lacks atmospheric texture, failing to contextualize supernatural conspiracies; peacock imagery and antique seal evoke Victorian mystery but clash tonally with modern test environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (peacock eyes, seal as key) has conceptual flair but remains allegorical rather than organic; ending's "weight lifted" trope fails to transcend genre clichés despite intriguing decoding mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Inconsistent sensory detail (vagueness about both orchardist's work and facility technology), overreliance on archetypal "lone obsessive hero" arc, and mechanical transitions between investigation beats suggest formulaic scaffolding beneath ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist awkwardly—sardonic orchardist investigating mystical seals via paper planes feels like forced concept-mixing; brevity masks underdeveloped thematic throughlines about surveillance and legacy.</comment>
