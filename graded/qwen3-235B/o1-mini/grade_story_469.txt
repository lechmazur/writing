<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (blameless, logically emotional) are stated rather than dramatized, with motivations feeling abstract rather than visceral despite symbolic key use.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed; the countdown creates urgency but lacks emotional stakes, while overreach consequences arrive abruptly without proper buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("whispering gallery," "scent of blooming garden") establish mood, but sensory details remain superficial rather than deepening immersion or thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Heavy on stated themes about balance, light on actual emotional engagement; symbolism (key, gallery) hints at deeper meaning but isn't fully realized through character actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on contradictory descriptors ("grandiose modesty") and abstract phrases ("logically emotional resolve") creates artificial tone rather than genuine emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently integrated - some feel checklist-driven rather than organically connected to narrative momentum or character transformation.</comment>
