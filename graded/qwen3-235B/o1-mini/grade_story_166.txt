<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Geothermal streams and frost/steam creatures create striking visuals but underutilized thematically; "spectral moonlight" and ice crystals evoke mood but disconnected from core conflict; forbidden logs' ancient symbols clash tonally; sensory details prioritize novelty over immersive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ethereal imagery and fate metaphors elevate atmosphere but lack subtext depth; theme of communication vs. chaos remains surface-level; overwritten phrases ("symphony of voices") dilute emotional impact; conflict resolution through object retrieval feels unsatisfyingly simplistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plastic straw and frost/steam creatures offer originality but execution leans on whimsical clich√©s; forbidden logs echo trope-heavy fantasy; "gentle chaos" tone maintained but lacks nuance; avoids overt purple prose though occasionally sacrifices clarity for poetic abstraction.</comment>
