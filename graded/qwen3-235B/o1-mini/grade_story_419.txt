<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's empathy and no-nonsense traits are mentioned but lack deep integration into specific decisions or conflicts; motivation to "show humanity's heart" feels abstract rather than driving tangible narrative stakes; voice lacks distinctiveness despite third-person perspective focusing on internal thoughts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a simple preservation arc with beginning/middle/end coherence in 500 words; action of mending glass sustains momentum but lacks progression beyond repetitive hammering gestures; cause-effect for mollifying spirits remains vaguely mystical rather than narratively earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Eerie haunted dollhouse setting has vivid skeletal atmosphere through sensory details (echoes, muted colors, "hollow halls") but relies on gothic clichés; connection between miniature rooms and preservation theme feels underdeveloped; "after last human memory" timeframe lacks concrete environmental evidence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors like "heartbeat in sync with forgotten memories" create emotional resonance; ending achieves symbolic closure through glowing stained glass; some poetic overwriting ("pulse of the heart she helped sustain") dilutes stronger imagery; themes about legacy feel more stated than earned through character struggle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Combines haunted preservation trope with unusual blacksmith protagonist but leans on ornate descriptors ("labyrinthine corridors of legacy") instead of specific details; avoids extreme clichés but lacks subversive edge; empathic intuition as method feels convenience-driven rather than exploring nuanced emotional complexity; tone wavers between gothic haunting and sentimental restoration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration feels functional but underimaginative; attempts to connect haunted legacy with preservation succeed superficially but lack deeper philosophical interrogation; poetic imagery elevates basic premise but cannot compensate for thin character interiority and predictable thematic arc; brevity serves mood better than plot development.</comment>
