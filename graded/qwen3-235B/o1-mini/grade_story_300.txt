<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lacks distinct voice and inconsistent motivation; "outlaw" label unearned through actions, motivations feel generic and underexplored despite frequent repetition of traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot direction exists but momentum collapses under repetitive descriptions; no clear arc, just circular "searching for smudges" sequences that stagnate development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Setting reduced to generic antiquity tropes; sensory details are bland and inconsistently applied between marketplace energy and introspective lulls.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overused phrases like "shimmer of possibility" replace genuine emotional engagement; storytelling relies on telling rather than showing key revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d outlaw tropes, repetitive phrasing ("wistfully pragmatic" appears 4 times), and artificial tension; tone shifts feel algorithmic rather than intentional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elements feel shoehorned rather than integrated; fails to connect character psychology to setting or action in meaningful ways despite explicit directives.</comment>
