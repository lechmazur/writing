<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character shows a clear transformation from rigidity to empathy, but motivations lack psychological depth; the 'voice' remains overly stylized rather than distinct. The assigned attribute shapes actions but not inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a contemplative arc with the 'puzzle piece' moment as climax, but pacing drags during atmospheric descriptions. The adhesive analysis lacks narrative urgency, and the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting merges gothic decay with scientific mysticism effectively; sensory details (mist-fogged glass, owl’s call) immerse readers. However, the gravestones-hill connection to character transformation remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of balance and buried hope resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on clichéd symbols (light bulb as change). The final epiphany leans on telling rather than showing the transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predictable gothic tropes undercut originality. Phrases like "arms of steel" and "delicate balance" feel formulaic. The Tesla bulb offers a fresh twist, but the narrative avoids subverting expectations, leaning on lyrical abstraction over concrete innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere atmospherically but strain logically (e.g., adhesive analysis as pivotal method). The tone is consistent, yet the brief length exposes underdeveloped intersections between plot and theme, leaving a polished but shallow impression.</comment>
