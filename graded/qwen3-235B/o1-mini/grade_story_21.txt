<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Presentation of a clear but insufficiently complex motivation; surface-level connections between abrasive calm and decision-making lack emotional or psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression feels contrived - decoding genetic patterns occurs without meaningful obstacles; arbitrary pauses in drum circles undermine narrative logic in tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on superficial sensory clich√©s (drum rhythms, must smells) without creating immersive or coherent environmental impact on character actions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Multiple elements of purple prose and abstract buzzwords ("organically synthetic") undercut authenticity; bandit backstory feels tacked-on rather than organically integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Over-stuffed narrative attempts to combine too many elements with uneven success; some clever intersections but overall feels like checklist-driven rather than organically conceived.</comment>
