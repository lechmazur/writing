<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character's traits (guarded, whimsical) and motivation (preserve wisdom) are stated but superficially explored; her actions and context lack distinct voice and consistent nuance, weakening psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abstract description over action; circular structure (rocking chair) suggests cohesion but lacks narrative momentum, cause-effect logic, or meaningful resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (dim light, rust, hum), contrasting industrial decay with natural symbolism; setting enhances character's purpose and tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Craft demonstrates poetic imagery and thematic coherence (resilience, humility) but relies on stated emotions; ending resonates conceptually but lacks visceral emotional impact or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality diluted by ornate, repetitive phrasing ("mysterious brilliance," "pensive mirth"); some fresh juxtapositions (apothecary in power plant) but feels occasionally formulaic in its mystical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through tone and setting, but interplay of elements (amulet, method) feels underexplored; brief length serves atmosphere but limits narrative urgency or thematic complexity.</comment>
