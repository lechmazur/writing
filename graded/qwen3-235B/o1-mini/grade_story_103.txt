<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Renders motivation as abstract psychological struggle but lacks concrete backstory, emotional specificity, or behavioral consistency; the knight's "weatherbeaten" state remains surface symbolism without deep character revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conceptual through-line about internal vs. external escape exists, but plot progression feels rushed and arbitrary; the pivotal pattern discovery lacks logical buildup, undermining causal relationships in the otherwise complete arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Visually atmospheric but shallow in sensory texture; the lighthouse's mirrored reflections and stormy setting create intriguing mood but underutilized to explore thematic connections to character psychology or object symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Employes effective literary devices (e.g., transforming mirrors as emotional realization) but struggles with balancing introspective abstraction against narrative concreteness; ending achieves thematic unity but falls short of profound emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on Gothic tropes (stormy lighthouse, knightly regret, symbolic mirrors) without subversion; ornate descriptions often substitute for substantive character or thematic development, with predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Most assigned elements present but loosely integrated; the story's structural framework exists to showcase prompts rather than organically unify them into a cohesive artistic vision.</comment>
