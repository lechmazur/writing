<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's "underestimated rebel" trait is underexploited; motivations for revisiting the haunted house are psychologically thin. Emotional duality ("sadly joyful") resonates superficially but lacks behavioral specificity. Pocket knife symbolism remains abstract rather than embodying tangible adaptive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited plot complexity inherent to short form is somewhat mitigated by clear emotional arc. Phone call as inciting incident drives progression effectively, though haunted house exploration feels structurally hollow. Pacing prioritizes mood over narrative momentum, creating imbalance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park offers atmospheric potential that's only partially realized. Sensory details lean on familiar Gothic tropes (cracks, coldness, whispers) without distinctive reinvention. Setting-character symbiosis exists but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (lingering gloom, adapting blade) function superficially but lack conceptual ambition. Emotional impact relies heavily on stated sentimentality rather than subtextual interplay. Theme of transformation is coherent but executed through sentimental platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Excessive abstract phrasing ("ephemeral gloom") borders on purple prose. Emotional beats follow predictable AI-generated formulas with generic descriptors. Haunted house tropes and ramen backstory feel mechanically inserted rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stories-as-objects integration is partially successful but strained. Short form limits character exploration while amplifying reliance on convenient symbols. Lingering emotional resonance is diluted by over-declared thematic statements.</comment>
