<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (learning healing traditions) is clear but underexplored. "Gracefully awkward" informs physicality more than decision-making. Nightmares lack integration with core personality traits. Emotional connections feel superficial despite consistent actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plotted with clear beginning-middle-end but strained by word count. The coded letter inciting incident works, but decoded revelations feel rushed. Revamping the ossuary provides structural backbone. Pacing prioritizes plot over character nuance. Cause-effect between nightmares and discoveries remains vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vivid setting clash between ossuary bones and gourmet restaurant creates intriguing tension. Sensory details (decor, forest trails) immerse but lack deeper symbolic connections. Timeframe of bike rides anchors scenes but atmospheric shifts between war visions and present feel abrupt. Atmosphere enhances theme unevenly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (food/healing, bones/past) provide depth. Ending lacks emotional weight despite satisfying resolution. Central conflict resolved within constraints, but lacks lingering resonance. "Harsh tenderness" hinted at but not fully woven into craft choices. Style balances lyrical and functional prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original use of ossuary-turned-restaurant shines. Predictable hero's journey undermines uniqueness. Avoids purple prose but occasionally slips into generic phrasing ("reawakened nightmares"). Some tropes (coded prophecy, chosen one arc) remain unchallenged. Emotional subtext mostly stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story integrates most elements but feels strained by ambitious premise. Length amplifies underdeveloped themes. Atmospheric details suggest potential depth but aren't fully exploited. Style suits content without elevating it. Ends competently but lacks transcendent quality.</comment>
