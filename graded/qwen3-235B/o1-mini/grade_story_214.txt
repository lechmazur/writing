<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has symbolic weight but lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through emotionally grounded actions or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but rushed; the pivotal shift from decoding to success feels abrupt, though the tight arc mirrors the constrained word limit effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting blends sci-fi and maritime elements evocatively; "floating observatory" and "restless sea" create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that deepens thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (black hole, sea glass) elevates the story, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract prose that occasionally tells rather than shows.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in concept pairing (microfilm archives + cosmic doubt), but metaphors like "silently audible" lean clichéd; tone is distinct yet occasionally muddied by ornamental phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around a central theme but occasionally strain under their own abstraction; the ending’s poetic closure compensates for occasional narrative disjointedness.</comment>
