<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Vague sensory overload dominates; atmospheric potential undercut by overreliance on visual descriptors. The setting's mystical qualities remain superficially sketched.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Functional cohesion exists but lacks urgency or revelatory impact. The ending feels like a checklist completion rather than a transcendent payoff.</comment>
