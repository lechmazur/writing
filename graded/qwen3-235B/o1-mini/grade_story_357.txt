<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent in her focus and solitude, but motivations for overcoming despair lack depth. The black rose symbolizes her journey but isn't deeply tied to her actions. Dialogue or inner conflict could strengthen voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but feels rushed in transitions between board games and the quest. The conceptual parallels between game rounds and battling despair are clever, but pacing unevenly uses the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Frost giant's lair is underdeveloped beyond "icy grandeur." Board game atmosphere contrasts weakly with the mystical elements. Sensory details are sparse; setting doesn't meaningfully enhance the core struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery (black rose, board games as metaphors) is purposeful but not deeply innovative. Ending resolves the surface conflict, but emotional resonance is muted by reliance on conceptual abstractions over visceral storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (lonely heroine, symbolic rose, mythical lair) without subverting them. Some "purple prose" in descriptions. The "earnest flippancy" tone is asserted rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently woven but lack cohesion. The forced integration of board games feels like a gimmick. The ending hints at depth but doesn't fully transcend its archetypal framework for meaningful reflection.</comment>
