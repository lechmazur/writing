<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "rattled" and "inwardly social" are stated but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth. Actions align with goals but feel surface-level due to minimal emotional showing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; puzzles lack mechanical/plot integration. Pacing is uneven with abrupt transitions between dance lessons and supernatural elements. Resolution feels rushed despite clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mix of psychic facility machinery and dance lessons creates dissonant atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse; the setting and timeframe connection feels arbitrary rather than thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Blandly states themes of synthesis rather than embodying them through craft. Metaphors like "dance of science/mysticism" remain unexplored. Ending lacks emotional heft despite satisfying concept.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on generic descriptors like "pulsating" and "guarded." Premise combines tropes (psychic labs, hidden rooms) without subverting expectations. Writing style frequently veers into purple prose, especially with adjectives like "entwined" and "catalyst."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements feel modular rather than organically connected. Short length works against thematic complexity. Some creative interplay between occult and science, but leaves no lingering impact beyond surface narrative.</comment>
