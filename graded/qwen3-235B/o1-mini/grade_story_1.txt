<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait (phobia-ridden stunt double) remains superficially stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior or internal conflict; motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" lacks specificity in driving plot actions. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of entering, confronting, and overcoming the net's knots, but the assigned action's logic strains credibility; pacing manages to resolve within word limits yet feels rushed in emotional payoff. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting (pyramid library) and atmosphere rely on clich√©d descriptors ("forgotten," "echoes") without immersive sensory details; "mundanely spiritual" attempts contrast but fails to cohere meaningfully with tone or plot. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Limited emotional resonance; metaphors (knots = anxiety) are overt but lack subtlety or subtext; ending feels artificially tidy rather than earned, weakening thematic impact. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "echoes in the dark" recur without purpose; overly ornate descriptions (e.g., "numb fascination") prioritize aesthetic over authenticity; relies on common metaphors without fresh angles. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements feel shoehorned rather than organically integrated; style oscillates between florid and sparse; length exposes lack of narrative depth, feeling constrained rather than purposeful. </comment>
