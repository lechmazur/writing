<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are evident but feel more symbolic than psychologically nuanced; motivations are clear but lack complexity beyond archetypal roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; cohesive in mood but lacks conflict/resolution arc within the constrained word limit, relying on thematic reflection over narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., glowing brass tape) create atmosphere, but the social network archive feels awkwardly juxtaposed without sufficient contextual integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by overly ornate phrasing ("jubilant remorse") and predictable thematic contrasts; some AI-generated cadences in repetitive descriptive patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly thematic but unevenly executed; the storyâ€™s elegance is overshadowed by structural looseness and reliance on abstract concepts over compelling narrative.</comment>
