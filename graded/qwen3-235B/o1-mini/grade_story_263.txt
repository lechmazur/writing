<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Weak internal consistency; plush symbolism lacks clear behavioral impact, motivation inconsistently tied to actions, dialogue feels didactic rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes atmospheric description over plot progression; pivotal interactions feel truncated, cause-effect logic obscured by decorative prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Coral reef functions as flat backdrop rather than active setting; sensory details are visually vivid but emotionally inert, disconnected from narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Overreliance on overt thematic statements; symbolism (plush, echoes) operates mechanically rather than organically; emotional impact undermined by conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Formulaic character archetype (tortured assassin) adorned with clich√©d "deep" metaphors; inconsistent tone shifts suggest artificial construction rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Lyrical surface distracts from shallow exploration of themes; elements coexist without interpenetration, leaving story feeling like disconnected vignettes rather than unified whole.</comment>
