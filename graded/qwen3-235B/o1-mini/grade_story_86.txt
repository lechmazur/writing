<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are named but insufficiently demonstrated; motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded, with limited emotional texture beneath stated emotions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot progression feels contrived—transitions between festival, ancient bones, and cyberpunk center lack logical flow; resolution arrives abruptly without earned emotional payoff despite word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Visually stylized but hollow worldbuilding; neon-lit streets and servers are clichéd cyberpunk tropes; "borrowed dawn" tone remains superficially evocative without thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Symbols (candle, bow) gesture at subtext without delivering it; ending resolves surface conflicts but lacks emotional resonance or thematic complexity; themes told, not dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Predictable archetypes (truth-seeking archer, lying data guardians); overused metaphors ("constellations as servers") lack originality; mechanical prose with generic descriptors and underdeveloped emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Forced integration of assigned elements creates narrative friction; ambitious blending of ancient/futuristic tones fails to cohere; ideas outweigh execution, leaving thematic hollowness.</comment>
