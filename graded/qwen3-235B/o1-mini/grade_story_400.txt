<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eira's guarded nature and ambivalence are present but lack depth; motivations drive the plot but aren't fully explored through nuanced internal/external conflicts; reactions to lineage gathering and safety pin hint at development but feel abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional arc from isolation to ancestral connection, but pacing feels compressed; the ritual meal structure is logical but lacks tension/resolution complexity; resolution through ancestral apparitions veers toward contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glacial orchard and blue ice crevasse create vivid, haunting atmosphere; post-apocalyptic setting underutilized; sensory details (shimmering twilight, clinking silverware) immerse but could better integrate with character emotions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (safety pin, silence vs. connection) is effective but slightly heavy-handed; ending offers emotional resonance but lacks narrative surprise; theme of confronting fear is cohesive if somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some lyrical prose compensates for occasional clich√©d phrases ("edge of despair and hope"); avoids overt predictability but relies on familiar isolation-redemption tropes; emotional nuance exists but borders on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements (safety pin, ancestral gathering) are purposeful but occasionally feel checklist-driven; tone remains consistent; brevity works for mood but limits deeper exploration of post-human existential themes.</comment>
