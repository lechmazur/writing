<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lacks sufficient depth in Ethan's inner psyche; motivation to understand the past is hinted but underdeveloped through actions. The scalpel's traumatic significance contrasts weakly with obsessive receipt-doodling method, which feels more gimmicky than revelatory about his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative achieves an arc through pattern discovery, but pacing stumbles between lab setup and fireworks resolution. The "globalize" action is abstract rather than plot-driven; cause-effect logic between doodle alignment and existential realization feels strained within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Crystal lab's visual appeal succeeds, but integration fails—why crystalline structures connect to memory/doodling remains unearned. Sensory details like "pale light" and "shimmering" create mood but lack visceral specificity to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (crystals as memory, fireworks as rebirth) operate at surface level. Theme of self-determination lacks subtextual complexity, while ending's hopeful drink-pouring feels narratively unsatisfying despite competent prose craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overreliance on brooding descriptors ("jaded," "fractured") and clichéd imagery ("stars guiding destiny"). The receipt-doodle method attempts ingenuity but collapses into mechanical plotting; emotional tension feels narratively imposed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story functions as atmospheric vignette rather than cohesive narrative. Elements combine competently but lack transformative synergy; the ending provokes mild reflection without lasting resonance beyond its immediate symbolic gestures.</comment>
