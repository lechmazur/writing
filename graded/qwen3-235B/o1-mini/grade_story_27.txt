<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elliot's curse defines his voice and interactions, but his internal struggle remains underexplored; the stagnant visitor's transformation lacks psychological depth despite being tied to his motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Central action (petrification) drives the narrative but pacing stumbles: moon phases are casually invoked without buildup, resolution feels abrupt despite thematic symmetry between cursed truth and immutability.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Haunted park and birdwatching coexist uneasily; "layered tranquility" is stated more than embodied through specific sensory details like scent of rusted metal or texture of pencil box engravings.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Moon-as-time metaphor and petrification-as-truth symbolism show promise, but subtext about self-deception collapses under didacticism; dialogue feels ritualistic rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overreliance on "tapestry of fate" trope; "polished wooden booth" vs "silvery light" descriptions lack visceral specificity; petrification reads as fantasy device rather than earned transformation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function mechanically but cohesively: the pencil box as truth-revealer works conceptually, while birdwatchers and amusement park remain tonal dissonances that undermine emotional engagement.</comment>
