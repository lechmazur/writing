<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth; character traits are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. Motivation feels imposed rather than organically integrated into behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is present but uneven; high-concept elements accelerate the narrative without organic escalation. Pacing feels artificially compressed, sacrificing causal clarity (e.g., undramatized weakening of the ward).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is striking but unevenly grounded; obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn setting create mood, but abstract descriptions (e.g., "lucid confusion") overwhelm specific sensory details, reducing immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolic imagery enrich subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks visceral character payoff or narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original concepts (e.g., ice skates as keys) contrast with formulaic phrasing ("seeds of knowledge"). Excessive ornamentation (e.g., "labyrinth of secrets") undermines tonal consistency; surrealism risks feeling like aesthetic over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition is evident, but cohesion falters under thematic overload. Assigned elements are technically utilized but strain narrative logic; surreal undertones lack sufficient grounding for sustained engagement.</comment>
