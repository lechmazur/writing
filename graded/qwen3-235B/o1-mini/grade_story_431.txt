<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's introverted nature is clear and influences her solitary problem-solving, but emotional depth and internal conflict remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but formulaic; the resolution depends too heavily on abstract symbolic actions (knitting as map-making) that strain narrative plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative, specific details (glowing lamp, decoder machinery hum) create immersive atmosphere that meaningfully supports both character and concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and sensory language creates lasting impact, but thematic depth is occasionally undercut by overt exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional clich√©d phrasing ("whispers of a time when people thrived," "mental fortitude") and emotionally simplistic conclusions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in practice; narrative sacrifices some believability for poetic symmetry between knitting and celestial navigation.</comment>
