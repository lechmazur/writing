<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Edginess is superficially stated without nuanced behavioral evidence; motivation to carry a candle through a void remains abstract, disconnected from coherent character logic or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Narrative resembles a static mood piece with circular pacing; lacks cause-effect progression, unresolved tension, and a meaningful arc that satisfies the compressed format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Vivid visuals (mushroom house, luminescent caps) create atmosphere, but sensory details are inconsistently applied and fail to anchor the reader in the abstract setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Drenched in overwritten abstraction and clich√©d existential musings ("comfortingly pessimistic"); lacks stylistic originality and authentic emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as disconnected symbols rather than organic narrative drivers; no cohesive synthesis between concept, character, or setting.</comment>
