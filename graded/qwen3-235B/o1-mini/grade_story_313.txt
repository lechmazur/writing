<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Leo's identity as a con artist informs little beyond his guilt; his motivation to interrogate ghosts feels imposed rather than organically tied to his deceitful nature. Emotional shifts are telegraphed without sufficient psychological nuance or distinct vocal identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows redemption arc but suffers from compressed pacing. Ghost interrogations blur into a montage rather than distinct interactions. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic continuity; cause-effect between spectral confrontations and Leo's transformation requires stronger connective tissue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dystopian farm lacks specific environmental details—rusted machinery, oppressive architecture, or social hierarchies. Atmosphere relies on vague "barren land" descriptions rather than immersive sensory language. Contrast between normalcy of ghosts and dystopian setting remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism of tape dispenser as hollow victories shows potential but isn't fully woven into narrative mechanics. Ending's hopeful tone lacks sufficient emotional buildup. Themes of remorse/redemption stated more than dramatized through consequential actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Haunting trope follows recognizable patterns without subversion. Phrases like "mild fervor" and "jaws of defeat" lean on abstract conventionality. Emotional arc feels algorithmically schematic rather than psychologically specific, though tape dispenser's symbolism offers brief originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements function individually but cohere poorly—story time framing, dystopian context, and dispenser symbolism lack narrative synergy. Style occasionally shows craft (ghostly normalcy contrast) but brevity exposes structural shortcuts rather than showcasing deliberate minimalism.</comment>
