<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but lack depth; the "freelancer" identity feels generic and doesn't uniquely shape actions beyond vague competence. Motivation to preserve elder wisdom is stated but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear problem-solution arc, but the transition from crisis to resolution feels slightly rushed. Beginning/end connection is effective but relies on predictable cause-effect without subtext.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Steampunk setting contains adequate sensory details (sounds, visuals) but lacks cohesion—wedding timeframe is disconnected. The atmosphere leans on clichés without transcendent specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on abstract phrases like "scattered harmony" and repetitive descriptors borders on purple prose. Emotional beats are told (e.g., "weight of her responsibility lighten") rather than shown. Predictable metaphors undermine originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist without synergy—the wedding timeframe, waves rhythm, and steampunk engine room feel compartmentalized. The story meets requirements but lacks a unified vision or lingering impact.</comment>
