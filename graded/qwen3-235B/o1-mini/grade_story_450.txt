<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to prophecy feels imposed rather than organic. Elena's linguistically inept trait lacks nuanced demonstration beyond stating "her words could not." Sharp-witted dancer label inconsistently manifested through abstract gestures rather than concrete physical actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prophecy-driven plot lacks concrete stakes or consequences. Mimicry as central action remains abstract, with cause-effect between gestures and patch energy poorly clarified. Tight word limit creates narrative gaps between prophecy setup and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thought experiment chamber and bubble bath setting combination creates visual dissonance with minimal explanation. Sensory details (bubbles, patch glow) are present but superficial, failing to fully justify the "saturated ambivalence" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective symbolic interplay between dance and denial, but relies heavily on celestial metaphors bordering on clich√©. Yearly photo concept shows promise as recurring motif but lacks emotional punch beyond "acceptance" platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overuse of terms like "saturated ambivalence" and repetitive "mimicry" language suggests formulaic repetition. Prophecy twist remains unoriginal, with weight-of-denial theme telegraphed rather than organically revealed through character actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Excessive adherence to assigned elements creates narrative fragmentation. Prophecy motivation and chamber setting particularly forceful. Family photo tradition and ambivalence tone superficially appended rather than organically integrated.</comment>
