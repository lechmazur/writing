<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Philosopher-king's "earnestly frivolous" trait creates engaging paradox but lacks emotional depth; motivation to solve labyrinth is clear but underdeveloped; betrayal feels abrupt rather than earned; character voice remains inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Progresses from mystery to betrayal to redemption, but pacing feels hurried; confetti-method connects weddings to labyrinth-solving but strains credibility; ending achieves closure while leaving key emotional arcs unexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (lanterns, sandstone textures) immerse readers; labyrinth's shifting light poetically mirrors inner turmoil; some underutilized potential in time-limited "readings" and sensory integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in kaleidoscope/resilience parallel; interplay of chaos/order reflects philosophical theme; ending delivers satisfying resolution but leans on predictable "betrayal as catalyst" trope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s with confetti-codes and labyrinth-as-tapestry; some overused descriptors ("weather-beaten") and overly poetic phrasing; emotional depth feels surface-level in key moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Well-structured framework with cohesive elements, but brevity sacrifices emotional nuance; lingering question of labyrinth's true nature remains powerful, while thematic execution feels uneven.</comment>
