<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of zealotry; reactions to objects feel underdeveloped, and the first-person voice (if any) is absent or muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a rudimentary arc but relies on predictable storm-as-metaphor; pacing is occasionally rushed, and the equation-driven action feels contrived rather than organically plot-shaping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (amber lamps, shifting shadows, storm) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbols (money as memory, equations as legacy) and metaphorical revelations; lacks depth in emotional subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept (chaos theory + legacy) but undermined by clich√©d storm/turmoil parallels and over-reliance on abstract phraseology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competently cohesive with strong thematic unity but avoids risks; short-story brevity feels like a constraint rather than an opportunity.</comment>
