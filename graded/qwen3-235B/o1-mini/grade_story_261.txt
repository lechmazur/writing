<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's motivations are vaguely tied to 'rigidly flexible' attribute; immortal essence lacks nuanced portrayal. Emotional depth is implied but not fully developed through actions or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed. The method of spilled ink restoration lacks logical explanation; some cause-effect relationships are abstracted to the point of obscurity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Particle acceleration garden concept is intriguing but under-developed. Sensory details are sparse and uneven; atmospheric elements like 'bitter laughter' feel disconnected from immersive world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphors effectively but relies on stated emotions rather than subtext. The central theme of impermanence vs. restoration emerges, but the ending lacks emotional resonance due to rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by formulaic phrases ("history painted over," "fragile hope"). The earbud cover concept is inventive but feels like forced quirkiness rather than organic symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy. The story's core idea is compelling, but execution lacks the polish and layered meaning expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
