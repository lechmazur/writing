<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Apathy and insight coexist unclearly; transformation lacks psychological depth, motivations shift without sufficient catalysts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Static progression masked as "journey," no meaningful conflict/resolution; circular wandering replaces plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lush visuals but atmospheric tone clashes with underdeveloped setting-character symbiosis; symbolism remains decorative rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overreliance on abstract metaphors ("barbed wire arms") over authentic emotional engagement; ending feels conceptually labored, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Formulaic imagery ("giant mushroom garden"), inconsistent tone shifts; emotional beats rely on declarative statements, not subtextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially stitched together; gimmicky juxtapositions (apathy/compassion) lack narrative integration or thematic innovation.</comment>
