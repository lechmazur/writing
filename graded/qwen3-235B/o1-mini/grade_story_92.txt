<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Weakly developed motivations, superficially applied traits, and underutilized character context as a dog walker for the ultra-rich. Personality doesn't drive meaningful decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambiguous arc direction, inconsistent pacing shifts, and forced transition from blood drive to mansion. Plot coherence suffers from disconnected set pieces.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details in mansion scenes but overreliance on clich√©d "haunted" tropes. Color metaphors work better than tonal inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery without narrative depth. Subtext about connection exists but remains underexplored. Emotional impact diluted by vague thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise contains original elements but execution relies heavily on generic Gothic tropes. Purple prose and repetitive phrasing suggest formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements present but awkwardly assembled. Potential for thematic unity undercut by structural unevenness and lack of narrative urgency.</comment>
