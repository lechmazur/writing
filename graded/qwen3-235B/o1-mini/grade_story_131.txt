<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is consistent, but orphan aspect is entirely missing. Motivation to transform fear into courage is clear but lacks depth in connecting emotional arc to specific traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through cohesive garage-cleaning structure, but transformation feels rushed within limited word count. Cryptic message's sudden impact lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly fails to substantially shape the setting or theme. Softly audible elements create faint atmosphere, but sensory details remain underdeveloped and inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like stones reflecting resolve work well. Ending feels purposeful, but deeper exploration of "adapt or perish" is surface-level. Some showing (floating objects), but thematic weight relies heavily on telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Contains generic phrases ("whispers of the anomaly," "affectionate detachment"). The "gravitational anomaly" trope isn't sufficiently subverted, and emotional progression follows predictable redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrated thematically, though "aloof orphan" baseline is absent. The tight timeframe works well, but atmospheric elements remain thin. Leaves faint impression of transformation but lacks haunting resonance.</comment>
