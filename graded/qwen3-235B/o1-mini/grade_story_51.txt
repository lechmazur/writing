<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (breaking free from past) is clear but inconsistently manifested; "apologetic thug" remains surface-level archetype without nuanced exploration of criminal history; wooden crate slat symbolism lacks emotional weight beyond stated associations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Staged museum meetings drive plot but lack narrative tension throughline; beginning-to-end transformation feels rushed; cause/effect between character actions and outcomes (e.g., Elena's impact) glossed over rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Static Electricity Garden" offers intriguing conceptual contrast but receives minimal sensory development; atmospheric shifts (e.g., dissipation of static) treated as heavy-handed metaphors rather than organically integrated elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d resilience tropes rather than fresh insight; excessive expositional statements about transformation ("resilience as continuous journey") undercut potential subtext; emotional impact diluted by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Generative fingerprints evident: repetitive phrasing of "in the second a new silhouette appears," overused "quietly intense" descriptor, and formulaic tonal shifts; metaphors feel algorithmically selected rather than emotionally authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements forced into checklist compliance rather than organic integration; brief length amplifies structural artificiality; fails to create lingering impact beyond surface-level redemption arc.</comment>
