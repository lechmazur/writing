<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation as scapegoat is underdeveloped; actions feel symbolic but lack concrete psychological grounding. Vagueness about her past role undermines believability of her emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot hinges on transformation of washer, but cause-effect relationships between cryptic calls and Lena's discoveries are under-explained. Pacing uneven in tight word limit, resolving abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>"Cloud City" and library card timeframe are superficially atmospheric but disconnected from narrative logic or theme. Neon lights/solitude motifs lack specificity to create immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mix of poetic imagery ("robust delicacy") and repetitive similes distracts from emotional truth. Thematic exploration of identity is stated rather than dramatized. Ending feels trite.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on vague "sacred symbols" and metaphysical transformation tropes without subversion. Purple prose ("quiet aftermath," "enduring spirit") dilutes authenticity. Nuanced emotion overridden by abstract descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements shoehorned in (e.g., scapegoat role, cryptic calls) rather than organically integrated. Lyrical language often obscures narrative cohesion, weakening overall impact.</comment>
