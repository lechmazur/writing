<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract with repeated descriptors substituting for genuine development; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks coherent cause-effect chain; arbitrary elements like the harp decoding code fragments undermine narrative logic; classroom setting inconsistently transitions to electronic wilderness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich but disjointed sensory details (neon shadows, hologram trees) create atmosphere but fail to cohesively integrate temporal and classroom elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Purple prose and overused metaphors (misaligned harp as guide) diminish impact; some evocative imagery but lacks emotional resonance or thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing and repetitive descriptors (e.g., "eloquently silent," "shattered allegiances") suggest formulaic writing; conceptual combinations (time mastery via ML chip) feel superficially assembled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh execution; elements exist in parallel rather than synergy; brief length fails to justify itself as a deliberate stylistic choice.</comment>
