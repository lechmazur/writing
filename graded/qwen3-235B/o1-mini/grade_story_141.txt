<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Poor integration of "superstitious" trait; motivation (transcendence) is stated but shallowly explored. Dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rushed progression between plot points; strained causality between scavenger hunt and cave journey. Resolution feels abrupt, but structure is minimally coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (bioluminescent algae, thunder) but generic descriptors (e.g., "curious dread" underdeveloped). Setting supports tone unevenly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on mystical-woman trope without subversion; vague theme of transcendence lacks emotional resonance. Overuse of passive phrasing dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Formulaic combinations (storm symbolism, wise oracle) dominate; inconsistent specificity in details (e.g., "enigmatic sketches" undefined). Dialogue borders on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements used mechanically; story’s length exposes underdeveloped arcs. Memorable imagery undercut by predictable narrative patterns.</comment>
