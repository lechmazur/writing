<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character exists as a series of descriptors rather than a living persona; traits are stated but not demonstrated through meaningful actions, weakening believability and emotional investment</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Narrative structure is present but feels formulaic - the cyclical midnight ritual lacks escalating stakes or variation; cause-effect between actions and cosmic stabilization remains abstract, undermining plot momentum</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting contrasts (police station vs planetarium, synthetic vs organic) create atmospheric tension; however, sensory details often default to generic cyberpunk tropes rather than specific, immersive worldbuilding</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of organic harmony vs synthetic order is clear but heavy-handed; metaphors are serviceable rather than striking; emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition rather than visceral, embodied storytelling</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Predictable combinations of genre elements (cyberpunk mystic rituals) with insufficient subversion; repetitive phrases ("muted euphoria," "celestial signatures") suggest algorithmic defaulting; tonal consistency falters under scrutiny</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>All elements are present but unevenly integrated; story functions more as technical demonstration of constraints than organic composition; thematic resonance feels superficial rather than profound</comment>
