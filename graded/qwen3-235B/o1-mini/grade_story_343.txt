<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is defined by melancholy and iconically unintentional traits, but lacks emotional depth and nuanced motivations. Reactions to objects feel symbolic rather than psychologically authentic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but pacing feels uneven; tea leaf gatherings resolve conflict too tidily. Causal connections exist but lack layered narrative complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting provides rich aesthetic but underutilizes steampunk mechanics to enhance plot. Atmosphere is evocative through sensory details but tonal shifts are inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (drawing, tea leaves) but relies on stated emotions rather than subtextual nuance. Ending ties motifs together but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but employs comforting narrative arcs. Some purple prose ("iconically unintentional") and generic metaphors dilute originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements present but varying integration quality. Story structure feels deliberate yet constrained by checklist elements rather than organic synthesis.</comment>
