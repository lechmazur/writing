<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thorne's "docile bruiser" physicality and motivation to "mold a myth" lack concrete behavioral evidence; his "disturbingly calm" demeanor only superficially informs actions; "brash tenderness" feels arbitrarily assigned rather than organically consistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear plot architecture struggles with word count constraints: map discovery to labyrinth traversal feels rushed; cause-effect between myth-making theme and baton's climax lacks nuanced linkage; abrupt tonal shifts mar narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Greenhouse labyrinth's carnivorous plants serve generic "danger" trope; drum solos function as decorative atmosphere rather than integral sensory motif; man-eating flora vs. baton's supernaturalism creates tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("mud of reality," "symphony of the labyrinth") offer thematic consistency; ending's "harmonious resurgence" lacks emotional immediacy; central conflict (myth vs. reality) is conceptually clear but human nuance deficient.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (treasure maps, man-eating plants) dominate; "brash tenderness" and "symphonic heartbeat" verge on purple prose; language barrier concept underdeveloped compared to its stated narrative importance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-completed rather than organically interwoven; tight word limit exacerbates structural seams; thematic glimmers exist but are unevenly executed across character/plot/setpiece.</comment>
