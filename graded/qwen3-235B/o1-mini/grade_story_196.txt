<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than fully realized; motivation is clear but development feels more told than shown through specific actions and choices; "fiercely apathetic" mostly stated, not demonstrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Predictable arc from apathy to renewal follows logical progression, but transformation lacks dramatization of inner struggle; meteor showers drive plot forward but pacing feels occasionally rushed despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Floating monastery creates distinctive atmosphere; sensory details enhance mood but setting remains backdrop rather than active participant; some details approach vividness but don't fully immerse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of recurring motifs (clothes bag, celestial imagery) but relies too heavily on telling; themes are clear but not deeply explored; ending feels slightly pat rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Combines tropes (weary warrior seeking redemption) with fresh elements like "knowing naivety"; avoids most AI patterns but repetitive phrases like "plain cloth bag" risk mechanical emphasis; emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but some elements feel checked off rather than deeply integrated; brief length serves thematic simplicity but limits emotional complexity; leaves minimal lingering resonance.</comment>
