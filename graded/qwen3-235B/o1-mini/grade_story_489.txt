<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character traits are assigned but underdeveloped; motivation lacks emotional grounding and human nuance, reduced to symbolic gestures without visceral connection to the observer's actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot is fragmented and abstract, relying on atmospheric set-pieces rather than cause-effect progression; the connection between the dancer, observer, and lighthouse feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative nautical imagery creates mood, but overreliance on generic "haunted" tropes (whispers, shadows) undermines originality; sensory details are vivid but superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Symbology (whistle, whale) gestures at theme but lacks narrative weight; ending feels arbitrary, privileging poetic abstraction over emotional resolution or thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd gothic descriptors ("whispers," "shimmering cobwebs") and melodramatic contrasts ("aggressive kindness"); thematic elements are stated rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements are juxtaposed but not integrated cohesively; story operates as a loosely linked collage of motifs rather than a unified argument for tradition’s endurance.</comment>
