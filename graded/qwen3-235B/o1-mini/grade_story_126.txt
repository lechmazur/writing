<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete development; motivations are abstract and inconsistently tied to actions. Assigned traits are stated but not demonstrated through behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot is disjointed, with illogical cause-effect chains. Pacing is uneven, and the story’s arc feels contrived rather than earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting is underdeveloped; sensory details are sparse and generic. The atmosphere leans on vague descriptors rather than immersive, specific imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. illusion are present but superficial. Literary devices are evident but don’t deepen emotional resonance or engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing and abstract symbolism dominate. Predictable tropes (e.g., "last tree falls") and ornate language undercut originality and emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements are superficially incorporated but feel forced. The story’s brevity highlights its lack of cohesion rather than serving as a deliberate, impactful choice.</comment>
