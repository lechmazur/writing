<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations (Elias seeking connection, Mila's curiosity) and consistent traits, but lack depth beyond archetypes. Their interactions hint at emotional evolution but remain surface-level due to constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc is simplistic but functional, with logical cause-effect between key discovery and garden's opening. Pacing feels rushed in pivotal moments; emotional beats lack gradual buildup. Tight structure achieves closure but prioritizes symbolism over organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Vivid but generic cyberpunk visuals (neon, bioluminescence) create atmosphere without immersive specificity. Sensory details are unevenâ€”emphasizes sight over other senses; setting operates more as aesthetic scaffolding than active world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (key as connection metaphor) elevates impact. Ending resonates emotionally but leans on narrative shorthand rather than earned emotional weight. Writing style prioritizes poetic cadence over nuanced psychological realism, occasionally veering into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on cyberpunk and isolation-connection tropes without subversion. Overly ornate phrases ("cacophony faded, replaced by serene whispers") suggest artificial embellishment. Character emotions often stated rather than demonstrated through subtext, reducing resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements (key, rooftop garden) anchor the narrative but feel compartmentalized rather than organically interwoven. The brevity works thematically but sacrifices character/plot complexity. Lingers as a poetic vignette rather than a tightly cohesive narrative.</comment>
