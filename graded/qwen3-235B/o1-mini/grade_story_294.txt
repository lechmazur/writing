<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but lack nuance; motivation is clear but underdeveloped through action or dialogue; reactions to objects/method feel abstract rather than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has visible arc but pacing is uneven; transitions between beginning/middle/end feel slightly compressed due to word constraints; concept drives structure but emotional stakes lag.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gorgeously awkward mushroom hall immerses readers with vivid textures and visuals; atmosphere aligns perfectly with tone but some sensory details (e.g., stickiness) feel arbitrary rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses strong metaphors (prism, cloak) but relies on heavy exposition; theme of self-liberation is consistent; ending achieves symbolic resonance but lacks emotional gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (voicemails + prismatic light) but repetitive descriptors ("gorgeously awkward," "crisp languor") feel overemphasized; originality in object-setting synergy offset by generic psychological metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion strained by sheer number of elements; style occasionally elevates the plot but feels mannered; leaves faint thematic impression without substantial emotional anchoring.</comment>
