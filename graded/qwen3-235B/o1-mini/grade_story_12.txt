<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Abstract internal motivation and thematic growth present but lack concrete behavioral manifestations; the cartographer’s aloofness occasionally contradicts his community-seeking actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minimalist arc from isolation to tentative connection exists but lacks escalating stakes or tangible challenges; pacing uneven in moments due to thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imaginative setting details (holograms, glass corridors) contrast nicely with tactile memories, but sensory immersion remains inconsistently vivid (e.g., absent sounds, smells).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric texture (maps as emotional geographies, interconnected kiosks as memory echoes) elevates the narrative; ending resonates with philosophical weight despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some poetic phrasing risks veiling emotional clarity; fresh symbols (cracked tile, mall labyrinths) avoid cliché but occasionally lean on abstract conceptualizing over visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Technical coherence maintained, but narrative tension and character urgency remain subdued; thematic ambition outpaces emotional embodiment in execution.</comment>
