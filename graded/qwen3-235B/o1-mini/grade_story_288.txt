<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to create art is clear, but "professionally wild spirit" remains underdeveloped. The tattered flag's symbolic weight contrasts with shallow interactions with supporting characters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing stumbles between quarantine and sculpture creation. Connection to the child's school day feels forced, weakening narrative arc despite thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ozone station's sterile setting juxtaposes with emotional depth but lacks tangible sensory details. The muted sky and humming monitors evoke atmosphere, yet fail to fully integrate into character actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story hinges on unconventional element pairings but delivers uneven narrative cohesion. Some ideas linger, though symbolic weight outweighs emotional impact.</comment>
