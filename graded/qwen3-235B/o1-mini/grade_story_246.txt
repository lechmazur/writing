<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Basic motivations are clear but lack depth; Eric's 'discreetly flagrant' attribute remains abstract, insufficiently influencing actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed and artificial; rituals drive action but cause-effect logic is vague, particularly regarding 'polymerize'; climactic resolution appears hastily imposed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses specific imagery (electromagnetic glow, textured relics) effectively, but 'crumbling peace' serves more as label than immersive emotional reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Memorable symbols exist (handkerchief as ancestral relic), but relies too heavily on telling over showing; thematic potential about legacy vs liberation only partially realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overly reliant on genre clich√©s (ritual artifacts, cosmic scales) with minimal subversion; excessive abstract descriptors ('promise of eternal change') border on purple prose without deepening meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Elements used mechanically rather than organically; some imaginative connections (magnetism as spiritual tension), but cohesion weakened by formulaic supernatural tropes and sentimental resolutions.</comment>
