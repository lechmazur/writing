<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is abstractly stated but not deeply explored; the puppeteer's actions lack specific psychological nuance or personal stakes that make him compellingly human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure but suffers from unclear cause-effect between symbolic acts; the method feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically connected to the renovation goal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Setting exists as vague aesthetic backdrop rather than influencing character decisions; sensory details are generic, failing to make the temple an active narrative force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Masterful use of extended metaphors (e.g., stamps as musical notes); harmonizes fragmented elements into resonant thematic whole about reconstructing history, though occasionally veers into abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Original concept subverts expectations but sacrifices narrative logic; repetitive use of "whispering tears/symphonies" borders on self-parody, while emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; the brief format exacerbates disjointedness between high-concept symbolism and narrative progression.</comment>
