<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character remains static, motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or conflict. Dialogue absence eliminates voice differentiation. Thinly rendered beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as sequence of symbolic events with weak causal links. Pacing uneven between over-described atmosphere and rushed resolution. Concept-to-plot integration feels tacked-on rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric potential squandered by vague descriptors. Sensory details generic rather than specific (shadows, light without tactile components). Setting functions more as gothic wallpaper than active participant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heavy-handed thematic declarations replace subtext. Literary devices operate at surface level without emotional resonance. Resolution feels artificially imposed rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Formulaic combinations of gothic tropes with minimal subversion. Purple prose ("lingering shadows," "harmonious blend") masks lack of original insight. Emotional beats explicitly stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than interdependent system. Structural brevity highlights rather than enhances themes. Conceptual ambition outweighs execution in character, plot, and symbol development.</comment>
