<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lack of distinct character voice; motivations stated rather than demonstrated; traits remain abstract and symbolic rather than forming organic behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented progression without clear narrative arc; events flow poetically but lack cause-effect logic; cyclical structure undermines resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere with symbolic resonance; sensory details like shifting mask expressions and resonant pipes create palpable tension; setting acts as living extension of themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (masks, labyrinths) elevate thematic depth; inconsistent emotional impact due to poetic abstraction; ending lacks concrete thematic payoff despite resonant imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasionally clich√©d expressions ("whispers echoed," "labyrinth of choices"); symbolism feels intentionally subversive but execution borders on ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Strong conceptual coherence but uneven execution; elements amplify poetic tone at the expense of narrative momentum; memorable atmosphere outpaces character/plot development.</comment>
