<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks internal conflict or growth; traits are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Structure lacks narrative urgency or resolution; cyclical reflection doesn’t substitute for a coherent plot arc within the limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually rich, contrasting sensory details (neon vs. dust motes) effectively ground the theme; atmosphere compensates for plot deficiencies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</comment> comment: Strong use of metaphor and subtext but lacks emotional resonance; no central conflict or satisfying payoff weakens impact.

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyrical but occasionally veers into purple prose; environmental themes feel familiar without fresh subversion; "wistful" tone occasionally feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don’t fully fuse; brevity exposes gaps in depth; concept lingers more than story itself.</comment>
