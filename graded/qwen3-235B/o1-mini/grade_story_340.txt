<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Predominantly told rather than shown; traits like "endearingly feisty" are repetitive descriptors, not organically revealed through actions or decisions that align with being a "proud exorcist". Motivation to outshine shadow exists but lacks emotional depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end within constraints, but the sudden closure of the path and its removal as an obstacle feel arbitrary. Pacing compresses character growth into brief moments; cause-effect logic is functional but lacks organic buildup. Coherence relies on surface-level connections rather than thematic synergy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting exists as background texture. Minimal sensory immersion; "Amazonian treehouse city" isn't integrated into plot mechanics. The clock skipping a beat introduces surrealism that clashes with the naturalistic setting. Atmosphere leans on vague verbs rather than meaningful environmental interaction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some striking phrases ("wizardâ€™s battered grimoire") but over-reliance on adverbial "ing" modifiers weakens impact. Theme of responsibility/resilience is superficially stated rather than demonstrated. Central conflict resolves too conveniently without earned tension. "Showing" is limited to action beats without emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Formulaic adjectives ("battered," "vibrant") recur. Metaphors like "weight of responsibility" lack freshness. Tone shifts unevenly between mystical and cynical. Plot follows exorcist-takes-on-darkness trope without subversion. Purple prose emerges in repetitive descriptions of Mara's defiance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements included but haphazardly fused. The tight word count exposes structural seams rather than purposeful brevity. Some inventive premises (youthifying magic) emerge too late to create lasting resonance. Lacks transformative clarity or stylistic boldness that would justify strict length constraints.</comment>
