<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Eldric’s motivation is stated but not deeply explored; his actions are repetitive rather than revealing. The dolls lack individuation or meaningful interaction with him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>No discernible plot beyond static description. Repetitive phrasing creates stagnation rather than progression. Lacks a clear arc, tension, or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Etheral descriptions create atmosphere but lack concrete rules or stakes. Sensory details are vivid yet abstract, failing to ground the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on poetic repetition rather than emotional nuance. Themes are stated overtly, not demonstrated. Ending lacks revelatory weight or closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Formulaic metaphors (“ethereal grit,” “chorus of healing”) recur excessively. Relies on mystical tropes without innovation. Prose veers toward hollow ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack depth or interplay. Style obscures thematic clarity. Brevity feels restrictive, not intentional. Fails to provoke lasting reflection.</comment>
