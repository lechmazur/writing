<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Lacks distinct personality or internal complexity; motivations are stated but not deeply explored. Actions feel symbolic rather than naturally emerging from character traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on abstract leaps; cause-effect between coin tosses and reality collapse feels arbitrary. Pacing is uneven, with underdeveloped steps in the escape plan.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost town and dawn frame a haunting, atmospheric facade of reality. Sensory details (coin glints, shimmering walls) effectively evoke emptiness and tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Imagery is evocative but sometimes abstract to the point of vagueness. Themes of memory/escape are clear, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (simulated reality, haunted sentinel) with insufficient subversion. Overly ornate descriptions and underdeveloped metaphors weaken originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; some (coins, pamphlet) drive the narrative, while others (between shows) feel tacked on. Ambitious themes outpace execution.</comment>
