<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character exists as symbolic gesture rather than fully realized entity; motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or personal conflict to ground abstract yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression feels like a series of poetic declarations rather than dramatic action; cause-effect relationships are implied but underdeveloped; resolution appears abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and sensually vivid, though the fusion of underwater and cosmic elements remains more evocative than logically cohesive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance and thematic consistency, but emotional engagement suffers from lack of specific character experience within the grand abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids direct plagiarism of tropes but occasionally relies on poetic vagueness to mask narrative vagueness; language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction over purposeful simplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive and thematically rich, but the brevity sacrifices depth of transformation; poetic fragments coalesce into impression rather than complete narrative.</comment>
