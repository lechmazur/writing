<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but attributes like 'infuriatingly calm' lack nuanced integration with actions; reactions to objects feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but pacing feels rushed in mid-sections; cause/effect connections between objects and actions are formulaic rather than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but lacks narrative urgency; elements serve plot mechanics more than thematic depth; ending feels inevitable rather than revelatory.</comment>
