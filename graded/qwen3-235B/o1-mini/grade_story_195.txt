<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains passive and abstract; inner conflict stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions. Transformation lacks psychological nuance despite heavy thematic emphasis.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels compressed. Key transitions (sprint to transformation, return to acceptance) occur too suddenly, weakening emotional impact. Pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting lacks specificity - "nomad caravan" and "spring cleaning" feel conceptually disconnected. Atmosphere relies on overused adjectives rather than immersive sensory detail. "Joyful sorrow" never fully materializes beyond name-dropping.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (thread, moon trails) show promise but remain surface-level. Emotional resonance undermined by heavy exposition. Central theme of self-discovery is clear but insufficiently nuanced through character action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overuse of "moon trails" and repetitive emotional descriptors suggest formulaic phrasing. Transformation follows predictable arc without unique interpretation. Attempts poetic voice but often veers into pretentious abstraction rather than genuine originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Rigid adherence to assigned elements creates uneven structure. Some evocative imagery exists, but excessive abstraction and underdeveloped emotional beats limit deeper engagement despite thematic ambitions.</comment>
