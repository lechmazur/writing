<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Assigned attributes like "tense bodyguard" and "serendipitously stubborn" feel imposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot is overly schematic with abrupt transitions. The word limit exacerbates rushed development; cause-and-effect relationships are vague, and the arc feels artificially compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Setting is superficially described; the lunar greenhouse fails to evoke a vivid, immersive environment. Sensory details are generic, and the atmosphere inconsistently supports the tone or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on clich√©d metaphors ("fragments of overheard stories," "serene anger") and exposition undermines emotional resonance. Subtext and thematic depth are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Stilted phrasing, repetitive adjectives ("serendipitously stubborn," "timely rebirth"), and predictable emotional beats suggest formulaic writing. Metaphors are derivative, and character psychology feels mechanistic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story lacks cohesion and purposeful brevity. Assigned elements are unevenly integrated, often feeling forced rather than essential to the narrative momentum or thematic weight.</comment>
