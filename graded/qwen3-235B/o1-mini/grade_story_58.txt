<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's motivations and traits lack clarity and consistent impact; her loyalty and inner turmoil are stated but insufficiently dramatized or differentiated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through vignettes without clear stakes or conflict; structure feels static despite attempts at cyclical imagery between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere with flickering lights and moths is effective, but relies on repetitive phrases like "sanctified dread" that dilute tension and originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (moths, storms, journal) create thematic resonance; ending resolves arc but lacks emotional depth; subtext about coded resistance is engaging.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phrases like "inner storms" and "collective solace" verge on clich√©; some inventive combinations (coded comedy, moth symbolism) but uneven execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story integrates all elements but often forces connections; themes resonate superficially but lack nuanced exploration needed for literary distinction.</comment>
