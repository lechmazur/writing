<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically stated but lack psychological depth; actions align with stated goals but remain abstract rather than viscerally felt through specific choices or reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Narrative has a beginning-mid-end structure but lacks narrative momentum; cause/effects between actions feel metaphorical rather than dramatized, with tension dissolving into abstraction during pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting contains evocative mechanical-nature juxtapositions, but sensory details often prioritize poetic flourish over immersive world-building; atmosphere oscillates between concrete imagery and vague conceptualization.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich in symbolic resonance with recurring motifs, but emotional impact is diluted by reliance on heavily metaphorical descriptions that distance rather than deepen engagement; thematic consistency outweighs visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Excessive abstract phrasing and circular repetition of key terms ("graceless beauty," "singularly multiple") suggest algorithmic tendency toward ornate generality rather than precise originality; conceptual framework feels derivative despite surface novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Combines assigned elements cohesively on structural level, but execution prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative urgency; length feels like limitation rather than stylistic choice, with underdeveloped tension-resolution dynamics.</comment>
