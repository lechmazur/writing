<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's profession as soul-broker agent lacks functional integration with motivations/actions; "forgotten songs" motivation is clear but insufficiently grounded in concrete psychological stakes; gestures toward persuasive artistry remain superficially symbolic rather than emotionally embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot functions as lyrical vignette rather than structured narrative arc; choreographing through reversed labels provides weak causal chain; recycling timeframe creates vague atmospheric cohesion but no tangible plot progression; ending feels preordained rather than earned through dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative details like cloud-perched office and humming static energy create memorable surreal atmosphere; floating platform's gentle sway synergizes effectively with dance motif; some descriptors ("recycled atmosphere") remain under-exploited as narrative devices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose creates rich tapestry of meaning where dance becomes negotiation with history; "show don't tell" approach to emotional states via choreographic symbolism; closing image of transformed bottles resonates thematically but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic abstraction ("persuasive whispers", "dynamic interpretation") dilutes concrete originality; some sensory details verge into generic surrealism; character psychology feels mechanically assigned rather than organically developed; avoids major clich√©s through distinctive conceptual fusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual elegance outweighs narrative cohesion; assigned elements create rich palette without achieving symphonic unity; brief length suits atmospheric vignette style but limits emotional depth; intriguing premise that prioritizes aesthetic over dramatic impact.</comment>
