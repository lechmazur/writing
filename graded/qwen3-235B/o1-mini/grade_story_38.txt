<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation (non-violence) is present but superficially developed. Insomnia shapes actions but isn't fully explored as psychological struggle. Botanical samples symbolize growth but lack specific connection to personal history. Voice remains poetic but uniform, lacking evolution through self-doubt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through fragmented vignettes rather than cause-effect chain. Non-violent resolution feels abrupt, disconnected from earlier haunting whispers. Subway framing device poorly utilized to shape narrative momentum. Pacing prioritizes imagery over narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively conjures nocturnal melancholy through subway rhythms and botanical decay, but sensory details remain generalized. 'Empty abundance' and 'meticulous mess' create contrasting visual motifs that aren't spatially grounded. Whispers lack physical description to bridge supernatural vs. psychological.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Uses botanical metaphors and urban decay imagery purposefully, but emotional impact is diluted by diffused voice. Theme of fear transmutation emerges clearly though predictably. Ending resolves tension too cleanly without acknowledging lingering inner conflict, reducing psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Contains AI-like repetitions ('whispers,' 'subway stops') and formulaic transitions between settings. Botanical symbolism extends beyond clich√© but remains abstract. Emotional states often stated rather than revealed through action. Poetic diction occasionally lapses into ornamental excess without serving character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through recurring motifs rather than organic narrative architecture. Elements function as symbolic markers but lack interconnection - would benefit from showing specific moments of party confession catalyzing change. Final impact lingers on atmosphere but not thematic revelation.</comment>
