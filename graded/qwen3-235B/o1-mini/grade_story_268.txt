<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks tangible vigilante traits; motivation exists but remains abstract, unexplored beyond surface declarations of sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rudimentary arc present but driven by abstract imagery rather than concrete cause-effect; repetitive descriptors substitute for plot progression.</comment>
