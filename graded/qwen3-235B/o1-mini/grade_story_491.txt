<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks cohesion; "serene fisher" trait disconnected from plot actions. Motivation (seeking wisdom) is stated but not deeply demonstrated through concrete decisions. The wristband's significance shifts without clear emotional or narrative foundation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal progression—the story moves through poetic juxtaposition rather than cause-effect logic. The "centuries-old quilt" method feels arbitrarily imposed, with no internal rationale for why deconstruction produces illusion. No clear arc within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through precise sensory details (moonlight, shadows) and tonal consistency. Setting/timeframe create effective mood, but the greenhouse's thematic connection to extinct flora remains superficial rather than structurally integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than concrete storytelling. Metaphors (e.g. "tapestry woven from time") are generic rather than illuminating. Thematic tension between preservation vs. creation remains underdeveloped. Ending feels like vague epiphany without earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Persistent use of clichéd phrases ("wisdom in ancient texts," "bridge to the past") and ornamental descriptions suggest formulaic structure. Sudden narrative jumps between actions without logical transitions. Overly elaborate syntax ("the hush once a baby’s lullaby ends") feels artificially contrived rather than artistically purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements are superficially present but not meaningfully integrated—the fisher identity, quilt method, and illusion concept operate as disconnected aesthetic choices rather than interdependent narrative components. Tight word limit highlights rather than enhances cohesion.</comment>
