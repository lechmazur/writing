<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elliot's character relies on tell-don't-show clich√©s; motivations lack believable depth; "naivety" and gambling impulses aren't meaningfully connected to candle mold use; disjointed between abstract emotional states and concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works against coherence; candle mold ritual attempts to anchor progression but feels arbitrary; cause-effect loops between lectures/gambling/tides remain vague; abrupt ending strains containment within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as placeholder backdrop; tidal power station specifics never intersect with character decisions; candlelit dinners repeat without atmospheric evolution; sensory details feel ornamental rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical density creates haunting resonance; wax/spark/tides symbology connects across levels; emotional subtext emerges through juxtaposition; lyrical prose transforms literal candle-making into existential metaphor; ambiguous resolution invites interpretation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transitions occasionally over-rely on rhythmic repetition but mostly avoid formulaic phrasing; atmospheric unpredictability distinguishes tone; candle mold's persistence through shifting scenes shows inventiveness; maintains distinctive stylistic voice without devolving into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements technically present but loosely connected; thematic through-lines feel forced; style prioritizes poetic flourishes over narrative clarity; length amplifies rather than alleviates structural weaknesses; lingering aftertaste relies on metaphor rather than craft.</comment>
