<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Archivist's traits lack organic demonstration; motivations feel imposed rather than earned through concrete actions. Emotional depth remains superficial beyond metaphorical trappings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows symbolic trajectory but lacks narrative stakes; labyrinthine structure feels decorative rather than dramatically functional. Pacing uneven between dense description and abrupt revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative but over-reliant on contrast between fractured light/shadow; sensory details overwhelm functional connections between setting and character. Atmosphere dazzles but doesn't deepen thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on well-worn metaphors; "heart now beat with confidence" lacks psychological nuance. Symbol density crowds out earned emotional resonance. Ambiguous ending fails to crystallize theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Prose veers between mechanical poetry and conceptual abstraction; inconsistent tone betrays algorithmic generation. Overused "fractured beauty" motif feels programmed rather than inspired. Human emotional nuance absent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically assembled; golden age/timeline integration feels arbitrary. Theme recognition potential undercut by shallow execution. Conceptual scaffolding visible beneath narrative surface.</comment>
