<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains passive and abstract; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through conflict or nuanced action. Personality traits like "quietly rebellious" lack concrete behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks tension or progression; repetition of abstract motifs replaces narrative development. The cyclical structure feels hollow rather than complete due to static pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Superficial sensory details create mood but lack specificity or integration with narrative stakes. Atmosphere floats above the story rather than shaping it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on clich√©d metaphors ("tapestry of hope") and vague abstractions undermines emotional impact. Themes are stated overtly rather than emerging organically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Formulaic phrases ("ethereal grit," "cryptic dance") recur without subversion. Stylized descriptions dominate over genuine exploration of ideas or character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weakened cohesion from mismatched elements (e.g., "fairy light shop" as arbitrary backdrop). Attempts at depth feel performative rather than substantive, constrained by stylistic excess.</comment>
