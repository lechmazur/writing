<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rigidly symbolic with little internal complexity; motivation tied to abstract concepts rather than human behavior, making actions feel performative rather than organically connected.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Amorphous structure with no discernible conflict or tension; repetitive phrasing creates artificial momentum instead of organic plot progression. Ending offers false closure without earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric flourishes dominate over meaningful environmental storytelling; sensory details remain abstract and conceptual rather than visceral. Timeframe treated as superficial mood setting rather than narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Intelligent metaphorical scaffolding exists beneath prose, but over-reliance on thematic repetition dampens emotional resonance. Central conflict remains metaphysical rather than dramatically immediate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Invasive stylistic tics ('noble chaos,' 'seeds of reconciliation') recur like algorithmic placeholders. Purple prose flourishes (e.g., 'indefinitely absolute') signal formulaic grandeur over authentic voice. Tropes receive superficial novelty veneer but no structural subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but executionally inert; assigned elements shoehorned into ornamental positions rather than organically generating narrative. Lingering effect resembles mood board more than fully-realized fiction.</comment>
