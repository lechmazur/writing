<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Jack’s motivation (accepting trauma) is clear but remains abstract; his "privately public" struggle lacks tangible manifestations; the fishing lure symbolizes perseverance but isn’t deeply integrated into character choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc (loop → escape) but feels rushed; the time-loop mechanism drives progression, yet the cause-effect between "nesting memories" and transcendence is vague; pacing uneven in bridging emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quantum tunnel’s surreal visuals (swirling energy, raindrop sounds) vividly mirror Jack’s inner turmoil; atmosphere supports theme, though "forgotten recess" timeframe is conceptually murky.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("nesting memories," "baptizing nightmares") deepen emotional resonance; the ending’s transformation feels earned. Over-reliance on abstract concepts occasionally dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clichés but leans on familiar trauma-to-healing arcs; language is lush but occasionally veers into overwrought symbolism (e.g., "raindrops as heartbeats"). The fusion of quantum physics and psychology feels inventive but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (trauma, loops, sanctuary) but occasionally feel checklist-driven; the concise format highlights poetic themes effectively, though some connections (e.g., paramedic role) remain superficial.</comment>
