<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lack of concrete character evolution; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced conflict. The "chameleon" trait remains metaphorical without tangible manifestation in actions. Rational impulsiveness inconsistently applied, creating an impression of curated symbolism over organic psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence relies heavily on thematic repetition rather than causal progression; "reproducing cold-case mysteries" lacks concrete narrative progression. The beginning-middle-end structure exists but feels abstracted into poetic abstraction rather than dramatic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sensory details are impressionistic but unevenly distributed; sunlight/debris motif overused as metaphor rather than environmental reality. The "post-oil" setting introduced but not integrated with palace's cultural specificity; atmosphere drifts between gothic and post-apocalyptic without synthesizing either.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery of rebirth through art resonates, but emotional impact diluted by excessive thematic echo. Shows rather than tells only intermittently; key emotional beats ("healed silent wounds") remain declarative. The central metaphor is effective, but subtext lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasionally lapses into poetic cliché rather than fresh metaphor ("dramatic shadows mirror turmoil"). Character psychology follows logical progression but lacks human dissonance. Some atmospheric details feel generative rather than intentional—palace's transformation oscillates between literal and allegorical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce thematically but not narratively—each assigned component functions more as symbol than story driver. The economy of language is admirable but creates emotional distance. Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional penetration within the constraints.</comment>
