<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth reduces agency; motivation feels imposed rather than organically connected to character behavior. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</comment><comment>Elements function but lack transformative integration; brevity works against emotional complexity while leaving certain concepts undercooked.</comment>
