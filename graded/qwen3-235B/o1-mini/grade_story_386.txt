<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weak interiority and passive emotional expression undermine the potential depth of a character whose entire existence hinges on legacy preservation. Motivation is clear but lacks humanizing contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive ritual structure lacks narrative progression. The beginning/end mirroring creates circularity rather than a true arc, with astronomical timing device feeling arbitrary rather than causally connected to emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imaginative mechanical elements (atom-powered lighthouse) contrast effectively with ethereal borrowed dawn imagery, but sensory details remain superficially decorative rather than shaping emotional truth or narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical potential of textile-as-legacy is strong, but execution relies too heavily on stated themes. The lighthouse-as-bridge concept offers poetic resonance, though emotional impact remains muted through excessive abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on alliterative phrases ("hush of a line that never moves") and archaic cadence suggest formulaic embellishment. Atmospheric elements feel more curated than organically developed, with inconsistent tonal gravitas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>All elements are present and technically interwoven, but lack transformative interaction. The concept's poetic potential remains under-realized, with emotional payoff not proportionate to its grandiose cosmic symbolism.</comment>
