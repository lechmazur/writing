<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rapid, unexplained emotional transformation undermines character consistency; motivations tied to abstract concepts lack grounding in actions or dialogue; "stoic" traits inconsistently applied; insufficient depth to support thematic shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on contrived symbolism over causal logic; key transitions (wallet return → emotional awakening) unearned; circular structure feels forced; emotional arc collapses under word count constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes auditory textures (bees/radio/bar) effectively but fails to integrate these into character psychology; atmospheric details remain decorative rather than thematic; inconsistent time markers weaken spatial cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts to use paper plane as metaphor but execution feels schematic; emotional payoff diluted by over-explanation; promising interplay between radio static and introspection underdeveloped; theme declaration outweighs narrative demonstration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Persistent "telling" through clichéd phrasing ("pompous humility," "untamed sincerity"); sudden shifts between abstract concepts suggest algorithmic scaffolding; sensory details lean toward generic "buzzing" rather than specific authenticity; emotional resonance artificially imposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as isolated signifiers rather than integrated narrative components; ornate language obscures character authenticity; brevity fails to feel purposeful as underdeveloped concepts compete for attention; thematic closure feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>
