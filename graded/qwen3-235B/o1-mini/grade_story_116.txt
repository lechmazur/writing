<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Minimal character depth; motivation is stated but not deeply explored through concrete actions or emotional nuance. Reactions to objects remain abstract, lacking human complexity despite clear thematic alignment with "endless night."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels repetitive and cyclical rather than progressive. Cause-effect logic is thin; pacing drags despite attempts to compress within word limits. Resolution lacks emotional or narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid imagery like "black velvet sky" creates mood, but sensory details often prioritize aesthetics over cohesive integration. Atmosphere supports melancholy theme but conflicts with abstract "garden secrets" timeframe.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of watch bands and Polaroids elevates craft, but emotional impact is diluted by passive narration. The ending achieves thematic closure but lacks narrative tension or memorable character beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original concepts (mapping eternal night) undermined by lyrical excess and repetitive phrasing ("laconic exuberance"). Tone feels affected rather than authentic; some metaphors verge on clich√© through overuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are present but loosely connected, creating a mosaic rather than a unified whole. Stylistic choices overshadow clarity; brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional. Lingering thematic questions exist but lack emotional grounding.</comment>
