<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Flat characterization; motivations feel abstract, actions lack emotional grounding despite assigned traits. "Impersonating a missing person" doesn't reveal depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Stilted metaphors ("quiet pulse"), repetitive abstraction ("carved in stone"). Overly ornate phrasing without emotional payoff suggests formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements mechanically included but not integrated organically. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; struggles to mask artificiality within constrained form.</comment>
