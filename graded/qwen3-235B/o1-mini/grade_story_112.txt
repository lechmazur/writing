<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks individuality and emotional complexity; motives are clear but motivations remain abstract without personal stakes or backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmented progression of actions without distinct conflict or resolution; poetic imagery fails to compensate for structural incoherence in brief format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative details (fire, spices) contrast with underdeveloped setting; archive atmosphere exists but doesn't organically drive narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors undercut by repetitive thematic statements; ending lacks earned emotional payoff or narrative payoff despite lyrical language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing ("factually imaginative," "mournful elation") borders on clich√©; original concepts (hopscotch map) feel artificially imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Element integration superficial; poetic tone lingers but narrative urgency or transformative character arc absent despite thematic consistency.</comment>
