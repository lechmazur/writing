<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through action or conflict, relying on clich√©d desperation to restore family fortunes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot trajectory is logically coherent but perfunctorily executed, with underdeveloped obstacles and an overly convenient discovery of the recipe book undermining narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting relies on gothic tropes without distinctive sensory immersion; atmospheric descriptors like "blurry vividness" lack concrete physicality to fully materialize the haunted park's uncanny nature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Vintage setting and ancestral secrets rely on overused genre conventions; phrases like "harmonize chaotic thoughts" exemplify abstract conceptualization over striking original imagery or subversive reinterpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Element integration is technically competent but perfunctory; the final synthesis of themes feels preordained rather than organically earned within the word limit's constraints.</comment>
