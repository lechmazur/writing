<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Poor character depth; motivations stated but underdeveloped. The assigned attribute ("uneasy") is repeatedly named but not convincingly demonstrated through concrete actions or distinct voice. Lacks psychological complexity beneath surface-level self-reflection. Emotional shifts feel abrupt and unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot exists but lacks tight cohesion. The inciting incident (postcard-debris connection) feels artificially contrived. Pacing swings between slow introspection and rushed epiphany. Weak cause-effect logic between debris analysis and postcard revelations. Limited narrative tension despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting details are superficial. Orbital station described through generic tech jargon ("labyrinth of screens") rather than immersive sensory details. Timeframe clash between "picnics" and space setting creates tonal dissonance without purposeful contrast. Atmosphere leans on clich√©d "vastness of space" tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mixed emotional impact. Effective metaphors (debris as consequence) undercut by overused abstractions ("branches of redemption"). The ending feels like thematic overreach rather than earned resonance. Subtext about redemption through self-understanding is clear but thinly developed. Shows strengths but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasionally inventive (debris-postcard connection) but riddled with AI-generated phrases ("cascading remnants floating silently," "steadfast resolve"). Over-reliance on passive voice weakens immediacy. Emotional beats often told rather than shown (e.g., "her heart did a sudden lurch"). Tropes like "redemption arc" lack subversive edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Struggles to balance assigned elements organically. The tight word count highlights structural awkwardness rather than deliberate design. Conceptual themes linger faintly but lack transformative depth. Feels constrained by requirements rather than liberated through creative synthesis of components.</comment>
