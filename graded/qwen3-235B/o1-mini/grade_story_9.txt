<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character’s sarcasm feels performative rather than rooted in psychological nuance; motivation to “shape destiny” is stated but underexplored emotionally</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story leans into its absurd premise but fails to transcend archetype; elements coexist without interweaving into a singular, transformative vision</comment>
