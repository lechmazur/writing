<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Symbolic gestures dominate over psychological depth; Eli's disappointment and chronicler motivation are mentioned but inconsistently tied to his actions. "Passionate disinterest" is stated but not embodied through specific behaviors or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within brevity constraints, but emotional shifts between despair and resolution lack graduated cause-effect. Pacing falters during abrupt transition from "crumbling bridges" to cosmic stabilization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stylized visuals (inverted waterfall, celestial motifs) create ethereal mood, but tactile details (e.g., comb texture, water mist) remain underexplored. Atmospheric tone remains consistent but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (comb as regret, bridge as self-reconciliation) enhance thematic resonance. Final circular reference to celestial bodies provides closure, though tension between archer's literal role and social chronicler identity isn't meaningfully interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Inverted waterfall and celestial imagery verge on fantastical clich√©; tarnished comb symbolism avoids overused tear-stained kerchiefs trope. Understated integration of archery ("renewed bow grip") offers subtle originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Competent execution of surreal tone, but assigned elements function as set dressing rather than narrative DNA. Emotional authenticity diluted by lyrical abstraction; brevity exposes underdeveloped connections between social chronicle and personal redemption.</comment>
