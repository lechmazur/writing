<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weakly developed: "spineless" is asserted but never dramatized through action or consequence; motivation to "understand flowers" lacks stakes or evolution; no distinct voice in third-person narration</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Poorly structured: no discernible conflict, rising action, or resolution; atmospheric fragments replace plot; random shifts between vague abstractions and concrete images disrupt coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid but superficial atmosphere: toxic sky/greenhouse contrast works; sensory details (rain's "melancholic light") immerse momentarily; tone consistent but lacks contextual depth</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mixed craft: strong metaphors ("statically dynamic") undermined by repetitive poeticizing; themes of blurred boundaries hinted but never coalesce; ending lacks resolution or revelation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Derivative and florid: relies on clich√©d nature symbolism; stilted transitions ("Though often seen as spineless..."); inconsistent emotional nuance; purple prose dominates</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Disjointed elements; some atmospheric cohesion but shallow thematic exploration; style overwhelms substance; no lingering impact beyond surface prettiness</comment>
