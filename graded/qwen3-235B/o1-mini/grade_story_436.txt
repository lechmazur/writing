<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sorrow is established but lacks depth in showing how apothecaryâ€™s grief specifically shapes her actions beyond generic determination; motivations are clear but inconsistently nuanced through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time-bound urgency drives momentum solidly, but compressed arc relies too heavily on poetic abstraction rather than cohesive cause-effect progression; resolution feels rushed but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant (desert vs. sanctuary), but sensory details could be more specific to avoid lingering in vague, operatic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents and symbolic use of plastic/spoons elevate impact; lacks deeper subtext beyond legacy theme; ending achieves bittersweet closure but misses complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Some purple prose ("painful joy," "temperament mirroring turmoil") undermines authenticity; near-AI rhythm in sentence cadence and overreliance on archetypal imagery limit originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally woven but occasionally forced (e.g., dream catchers); tone/style create cohesion, though abstract execution sacrifices visceral engagement.</comment>
