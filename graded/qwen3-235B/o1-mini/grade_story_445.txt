<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting shifts abruptly between forest and disguise room; mystical forest atmosphere contrasts with the secret agent room; few evocative sensory details to support either environment; atmospheric hush of twilight isn't capitalized upon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stimulates philosophical consideration about pride/humility but lacks emotional resonance; imagery of broken/reforged objects is effective; ending feels satisfying thematically but narratively abrupt; explores theme surface-level showing rather than deep subtext.</comment>
