<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is cryptic and inconsistently tied to actions; "dutiful sentinel" trope feels unearned, and reactions to the hair clip lack psychological nuance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot relies on vague symbolism over narrative momentum; circular structure (lab to restaurant) lacks cohesion, with abrupt tonal shifts and unresolved tension around "destruction"</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Lab setting is extraneous; restaurant atmosphere superficially contrasts with concept but fails to deepen thematic resonance through specific sensory details beyond generic wedding sounds</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Deductive logic governs character actions rather than human logic; repetitive abstractions ("narratives that shaped reality") feel algorithmically generated rather than organically thematic</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Cobbled-together elements create disjointedness; lacks synthesis of attributes into unified vision, though the brevity-as-deliberate-choice veneer barely holds</comment>
