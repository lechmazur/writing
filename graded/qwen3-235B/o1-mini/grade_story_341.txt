<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and development are clear, but emotional depth feels slightly underexplored despite the amber rosary's symbolic role. The transition from caution to confidence lacks nuanced inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the tight word limit leaves some developments feeling compressed. The rally action effectively drives the narrative, though pacing could better balance introspection and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid but inconsistently utilized. The desert fortress's potential as atmosphere-enhancing element is partially realized, with sensory details present but occasionally generic. Ordered disarray tone needs stronger integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story shows solid use of symbolism and thematic resonance, but emotional impact lacks full transcendence. The ending feels purposeful rather than profound, with showing/telling balance generally effective but occasionally leaning on exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s and demonstrates creativity in combining elements, but contains occasional overreliance on abstract descriptors. Subtlety and nuance are occasionally sacrificed to meet assignment constraints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates assigned elements with thematic purpose, though some feel more naturally incorporated than others. The brevity enhances focus but slightly limits emotional resonance of character transformations.</comment>
