<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated, motivations feel polemic rather than psychologically nuanced, "stoic" contradicted by melodramatic rebelliousness. Object interaction lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot exists but feels schematic. Assigned action is present but underdeveloped; pacing uneven between static description and abrupt transfers. Thematic arc exists but lacks dramatic tension or surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is superficially rendered - generic "chilly" night, "pristine" museum. Underutilizes sensory potential of autumn harvest setting and tactile qualities of skull cameo. Timeframe element feels arbitrarily appended.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity vs conformity stated overtly but inconsistently enacted. Some effective metaphors ("cracks in façade") overshadowed by didacticism. Ending feels preordained rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose shows AI hallmarks: formulaic descriptions ("delicate features a testament"), forced contradictions ("cynical warmth"), clichéd resistance tropes. Overly precise descriptors don't deepen understanding. Subtext feels manufactured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements included but mechanically combined rather than organically integrated. Expository weight drags on narrative momentum. Attempts at depth remain surface-level, with familiar "lone rebel vs system" framework offering little new insight.</comment>
