<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inner turmoil and traits are stated but underdemonstrated. Motivation through loss feels abstract rather than embodied. Character voice remains diffused despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beginning/end connection exists but lacks dynamic progression. Pacing manages scope but remains static - more atmospheric fragments than narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("sun bled into horizon") undercut by generic descriptors. Setting-plot integration mostly superficial beyond symbolic rooftops.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery (spyglass symbolism) but emotional impact diluted through abstraction. Themes resonate faintly without piercing intensity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Flowery phrases ("architecture of cosmic balance") border on pretentious. Sensory details recycled rather than startlingly specific. Consistent tone but lacks visceral originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Elements nominally cohesive but relationships remain conceptual. Form follows brief but doesn't transcend it. Lingering impression fades quickly.</comment>
