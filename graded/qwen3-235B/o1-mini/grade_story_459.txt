<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but occasionally surface-level; the "elegantly clumsy" attribute shapes Marcus's actions but could deeper emotional ties to his ghost-seeing ability. The dried flower crown symbolizes growth but feels somewhat detached from his core profession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story’s arc from isolation to release is coherent but occasionally rushed; ghost tours and sand castles tie into the resolution but lack layered cause-and-effect. Pacing balances urgency and reflection but slightly compresses key emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sand castle lab’s sensory details (shadows, textures) create atmosphere, but inconsistent integration with the ghost tours weakens cohesion. The "complex simplicity" tone is evoked but occasionally disrupted by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (withering crown, sand castles) and metaphorical silence resonate emotionally. The ending’s thematic closure is poignant, though the central conflict between Marcus and the spectral realm could be more viscerally dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unique pairings like elevator repair and sand castles; metaphors are fresh but occasionally over-polished. Emotional nuance prevails without melodrama, though a few descriptive passages border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like the crown and lab are tightly woven, though the ghost-tour method feels slightly contrived. The brief format serves the story’s introspective core, though deeper exploration could enhance impact.</comment>
