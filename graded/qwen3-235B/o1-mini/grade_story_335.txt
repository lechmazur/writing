<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation for peace with the past is clear but underdeveloped; his "carefully reckless" nature and mercenary background remain surface-level, lacking nuance beyond genre tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear arc, but pacing feels slightly compressed; the resolution relies on symbolic gestures rather than earned emotional weight, undermining tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery and thematic depth, but relies on brooding mercenary clichés and occasionally overwritten phrasing ("improbable longing"); subtext is evident but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with the cathedral’s transformation being a highlight; weaker integration of timeframe and rumor-chasing method slightly distracts from overall tightness.</comment>
