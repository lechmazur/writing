<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits remain largely symbolic; awe manifests as generic wonder without deeper psychological underpinnings. Motivation to topple fear is clear but poorly connected to personal history (veil) or specific character flaws, relying on thematic abstraction over human complexity. No distinct narrative voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into lyrical abstraction. Snowflake-guided cultivation as action lacks concrete progression; no beginning-middle-end structure. Recurring motifs substitute for cause-effect logic ("moral dilemmas" named but never dramatized). Pacing feels accidental rather than controlled within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ice floe lighthouse creates striking visual dissonance; "crystal shadows" effectively evoke eerie desolation. Sensory details like fluttering veil and dancing light enhance immersion, but post-emotion timeframe remains unexplored conceptually—no evidence of societal collapse or emotional fossilization beyond thematic assertion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (snowflakes/fear; veil/loss) create intellectual resonance. Writing style elevates concept beyond cliché, but lacks tension between abstract ideals and concrete action. Ending's "new dawn" feels narratively unearned; theme of rebirth operates on metaphorical plane while character arc remains amorphous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Creative use of "rationally organic" but occasionally lapses into self-conscious symbolism. Avoids genre tropes through strange combinations (wedding veils in greenhouses), yet some phrases ("shimmered under crystal shadows") verge on ornamental redundancy. Emotional stakes remain declarative rather than experientially demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not structurally—wedding veil and snowflake methodology lack functional narrative integration. Ambitious concept execution struggles under word count, resulting in fragmented impression rather than unified narrative. Leaves conceptual questions rather than emotional residue.</comment>
