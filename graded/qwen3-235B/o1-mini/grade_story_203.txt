<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but somewhat under-developed; stage fright primarily serves as backstory rather than influencing actions. The inheritance of lies drives the plot but lacks nuanced emotional grounding. Character reactions to objects/ritual show limited psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows basic arc but relies heavily on metaphorical abstraction. The turning key and exorcism drive action but lack logical cause-effect connection. Pacing feels rushed, especially in abrupt resolution of the inheritance of lies. Ending lacks narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting and toy assembly create striking visual contrast. Sensory details (hush, clang, glow) effectively evoke mood. Connection between debris/environment and internal turmoil is suggested but under-realized. Atmosphere enhances tone but not plot integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flowers as resilience, key as transformation) and metaphor creates thematic resonance. Ending avoids neat resolution by emphasizing ongoing process over finality. Writing style blends poetic imagery with visceral action, though some phrases ("sculpt possibility from ashes of never") border on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ambiguous blend of originality and clich√©. Orbital exorcism avoids genre tropes, but inheritance of lies is familiar. Some sensory details ("defiant hush") feel overwritten. Emotional resonance combines showing (flowers trembling) and telling. Unique perspective weakened by intermittently generic character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through recurring symbols but feels concept-driven rather than emotionally organic. Elemental integration is strongest with flowers/key/inheritance, weakest with orbital setting. Lingering thematic question about truth/emergence present but diluted by schematic structure.</comment>
