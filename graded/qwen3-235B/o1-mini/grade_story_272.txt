<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are present but lack depth; motivation is clear yet underdeveloped, often stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. The wooden whistle reveals his nostalgia but fails to fully intertwine with his personality or drive decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from decryption to construction, but pacing feels uneven—some moments drag while critical emotional pivots are rushed. The "reversed trails" method is conceptually sound but under-explored, weakening its impact on the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting creates atmosphere (diner’s isolation) and sensory details (whistle’s sound, diner’s hum) are effective but sparse. The archive’s digital elements clash with the physical diner setting, disrupting cohesion. Tone of "restless acceptance" permeates but lacks thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Use of metaphor (tree of regret) and symbolism (whistle as talisman) elevates the narrative. Ending offers resolution but feels slightly predictable; the theme of reclaiming identity through lost knowledge resonates yet remains surface-level. Tension between hope and doubt is present but unevenly sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</comment><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in combining diner setting with digital archives is notable but uneven. Repetitive phrases ("haunting melody," "restless acceptance") and abstract emotional descriptors detract. The core conflict is human yet occasionally veers into idealized, algorithmic logic rather than organic struggle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements like the whistle and regret metaphor enrich the narrative, but others (encrypted archive in diner) feel forced. Themes are cohesive but lack transformative insight; the story aims for depth but settles for atmospheric melancholy without lasting resonance.</comment>
