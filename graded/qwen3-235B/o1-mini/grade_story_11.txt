<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's 'flighty' trait is underdeveloped; motivation for legacy feels stated rather than demonstrated through coherent actions. Emotional shifts (serene anger to satisfaction) lack nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has surface-level progression but feels rushed. The connection between the mechanic's patch and map-linearization lacks logical cause/effect pacing. Resolution is abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting details (secret hall, candlelight) are superficially evocative but lack visceral sensory depth. Tone shifts rely on phrase repetition rather than immersive atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Themes of legacy/unification feel clich√©d. Over-reliance on "telling" emotions (e.g., "serene anger") rather than demonstrating them through action. Ending lacks earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Formulaic use of secret societies and hidden symbols. Phrases like "strangely normal" and repetitive "throughout practice" feel contrived. Emotional beats are surface-level and predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elements superficially coexist but lack cohesive integration. The brevity highlights structural weaknesses rather than enhancing focus. Thin emotional resonance, plot devices overshadow character depth.</comment>
