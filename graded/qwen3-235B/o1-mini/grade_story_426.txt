<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "angrily peaceful" and "secretive pathfinder" are vaguely stated but not deeply integrated into actions; motivations are clear but underexplored. The gesture of hugging the spectral conductor feels unearned, undermining emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but suffers from rushed pacing and loose cause-effect chains (e.g., hacking playlists → ghost train). Marathon training as a framing device lacks narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on familiar haunted motifs (moonlight, whispers) but lacks layered sensory detail. The teapot’s glow and ghost train visually anchor the setting, but the marathon-training context remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (teapot as heritage vessel) and theme of bridging worlds are present but surface-level. The ending resolves neatly but avoids lingering ambiguity or deeper reflection on preservation vs. evolution of traditions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (abandoned parks, spectral guardians) with minimal subversion. Prose avoids excess ornamentation but occasionally slips into generic phrasing (e.g., "eerily whispers"). The "hacking music" method feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly weighted; the teapot and folk medicines drive coherence, while marathon training and hacking feel appended. The concise format works for mood but limits thematic depth.</comment>
