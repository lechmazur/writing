<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains static, motivation is abstract rather than concrete. No emotional evolution or nuanced reaction to objects/concept beyond thematic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot circles a singular action without meaningful progression. Cause-effect relationships lack urgency; pacing meanders. Arc is implied but lacks structural payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alien setting juxtaposed with greenhouse creates vivid contrasts. Sensory details (metallic tang, aromatic blooms) enhance immersion but occasionally overwhelm coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "cup starlight in mortal palms") elevate theme, but emotional impact is muted. Subtext of legacy exists, but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Imagery feels both fresh and overwrought; "furiously tranquil sky" stands out. Over-reliance on paradoxical phrasing risks detachment. Tropes like "lost knowledge" lack subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated. Style prioritizes atmosphere over clarity; brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional. Lingering questions about characterâ€™s personal stakes.</comment>
