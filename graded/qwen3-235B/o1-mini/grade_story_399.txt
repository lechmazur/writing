<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; grumpiness is stated, not shown through meaningful actions/choices. Motivations remain vague and abstract rather than specific and visceral. Reactions to objects (tube/sand) feel ritualistic without revealing authentic human psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>No discernible narrative arc - static meditation scene without progression. Repetitive actions (jiggling, sand patterns) fail to create momentum. Ending arbitrarily shifts to "hope" without earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ethereal setting description lacks cohesion; witch's room and crypt elements don't integrate meaningfully. Over-reliance on vague "mystical" tropes without concrete sensory engagement. Atmosphere undermines emotional authenticity through excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d trauma metaphors (sand=memories) without innovation. "Healing through patterns" theme remains superficial. Ending feels imposed rather than organically developed. Tells emotions rather than dramatizes them.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Excessive purple prose ("multiply singular traumas," "grandiose subtlety") and formulaic mystical imagery suggest AI-generated embellishment. Emotional arcs feel algorithmically constructed rather than psychologically authentic. Overqualified descriptors compensate for shallow characterization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements arbitrarily assembled - none create narrative necessity. Style contradicts emotional depth claims through excessive ornamentation. Short word limit highlights fragmentation rather than deliberate brevity. No lingering resonance beyond surface metaphors.</comment>
