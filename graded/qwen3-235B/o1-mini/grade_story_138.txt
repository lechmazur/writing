<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations remain abstract with inconsistent connection to assigned traits like "hollow recklessness." The reassembly task feels metaphorical rather than revealing of concrete character traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot structure exists as thematic progression rather than cause-and-effect sequence. The action of reassembling stubs lacks narrative momentum within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on scattered sensory fragments rather than cohesive world-building; the spontaneous combustion lab's chaotic energy isn't meaningfully connected to character or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Literary devices present but underdevelopedâ€”metaphors remain surface-level rather than accumulating into deeper thematic resonance. Emotional impact is muted by excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("symphony of hollow recklessness") and repetitive phrasing suggest formulaic tendencies. Tropes like "forgotten noble" lack subversion, and the tone wavers between poetic and opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements coexist but lack synergistic cohesion; the story prioritizes mood over narrative purpose. Lingering questions are more about confusion than intentional ambiguity.</comment>
