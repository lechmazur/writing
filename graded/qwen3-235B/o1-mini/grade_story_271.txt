<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Psychological depth and emotional texture are underdeveloped; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through behavior. "Morbid juggler" remains conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Static progression without dramatic arc; reliance on thematic repetition over narrative momentum. The shared smile framework creates false tension rather than meaningful structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (spices, decay) create superficial texture without environmental logic. Object-setting relationship lacks causal connection or symbolic reinforcement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphoric layering of bent ruler as tradition distortion, but thematic delivery feels heavy-handed. Pacing prioritizes poetic texture over emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some AI-typical abstraction excesses present (e.g., "manipulate space with magical finesse"). Conceptually original premise undercut by formulaic descriptive language and lack of character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesive within its own framework but emotionally inert. Elements function as checklist items rather than narrative necessities; stylistic flourishes overwhelm structural purpose.</comment>
