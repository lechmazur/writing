<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but remains abstract; "theoretically rebellious" attribute lacks concrete demonstration through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies heavily on mystical cause-and-effect that strains logical flow; pacing works within constraints but lacks narrative tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual combinations (flower albums as glyphic texts), but occasional purple prose ('root-rot quiet') and over-ornamented phrasing undercut momentum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate conceptually but occasionally prioritize poetic abstraction over narrative cohesion; leaves lingering thematic questions rather than emotional satisfaction.</comment>
