<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Carven's telepathic nature and granite composition effectively shape his perception of truth-seeking, but his internal conflict remains underexplored despite poetic descriptions. The hair tie's emotional weight is clear, yet his motivation feels stated rather than demonstrated through complex choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ledger's revelation drives a tight three-act structure, but the inciting incident (Mira's disappearance) is underdeveloped. The cause-effect chain from hair tie activation to mass projection is logical but rushed, leaving minor gaps in the climax's emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory alchemy of steam, brass, and calligraphic light creates a hauntingly original world. The mechanized decay of the square and luminous rebellion details perfectly mirror thematic tensions, with each atmospheric element purposefully tied to plot or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like "ink-like energy" and "truly joyful rhythm" achieve lyrical resonance. The ending's collective recognition carries profound thematic weight, showing rather than telling social awakening through poetic projection rather than explicit statement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While some phrases (e.g., "cobbled heartbeat") risk purple prose, most imagery remains strikingly original. The calligraphy method avoids trope by becoming a literal power source, but the mayor's exposure feels slightly predictable despite clever buildup through mechanical symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements form a cohesive whole, with no obvious superfluities. The short form feels purposeful, compressing political revelation into a mythic moment. The lingering question about post-revelation consequences gives depth without derailing the focused narrative.</comment>
