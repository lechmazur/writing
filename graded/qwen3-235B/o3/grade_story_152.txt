<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character psychology despite consistent motivation; love letter's emotional weight feels underexplored despite driving actions. Frenzy manifests through plot mechanics more than nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mechanical cause-and-effect coherence works in surreal logic, but emotional arc flattens at climax. Sacrifice of knives lacks visceral stakes despite structural precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visionary setting details (phosphorescent index cards, drowned archives) create immersive mythic decay. Tactile void-to-water transition bridges conceptual gaps seamlessly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphor density (juggling as preservation, rind as map) rewards close reading. Ending resonates thematically but emotional climax feels muted despite poetic craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surrealism but occasionally sacrifices emotional clarity. Sensory details shift between striking specificity and abstract vagueness in same paragraphs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Elements serve thematic unity (juggling bridges chaos/order, void mirrors abandoned time). Slight narrative gap between tea-reading and bridge-building phases dilutes cohesion.</grade>
