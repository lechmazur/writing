<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Junia's 'bright-eyed' trait feels underutilized; her literal thinking and fear-as-energy handling lack human nuance. Motivation is clear but underdeveloped emotionally, though her decisive technical focus creates a coherent voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight hero’s journey arc compressed into limited space. Overcharging capacitors provide clear escalation, though the lighthouse’s technical mechanics feel rushed. Ending resolves the central goal while leaving societal implications unexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Post-drought desolation fused with nautical decay creates striking atmosphere. Sensory details (ozone, dripping brine, copper tang) immerse readers. Timeframe informs necessity but lacks deeper worldbuilding beyond water scarcity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("capacitors sang like angels drunk on ozone", "water still dreamed") enhance thematic depth. Ending ties literal interpretation of starlight to hope. Subtext about rebuilding through technical precision resonates emotionally without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by merging quantum tech with spiritual imagery. Some phrases verge on purple prose ("holographic rivers and starfall"), but most imagery feels purposeful. Human-like nuance in fear/conduit scene elevates authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All elements serve plot progression cohesively despite tight constraints. Limited word count enhances tension rather than hindering it. The fusion of technical and poetic language offers memorable stylistic distinction within genre boundaries.</comment>
