<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is abstract, symbolic, and serves thematic resonance more than psychological realism. Motivation to escape mental confinement drives the plot, but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative follows a coherent transformation arc within tight constraints, though resolution feels abrupt. Pacing balances poetic introspection with decisive action but lacks gradual tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually lush and sensorially immersive. Atmospheric details like "hammered repose" and coastal soundscape amplify mood. Setting as active metaphor for mental fragmentation succeeds remarkably.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (mirrors as identity fractures, sparks as potential) elevate thematic depth. Ending resonates but risks vagueness. Literary devices enhance impact though occasionally overwhelm narrative flow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality in metaphorical abstraction is undercut by dense, occasionally formulaic prose ("chromatic embers"). Avoids tropes through surrealism but occasionally teeters into stylistic excess without sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>ELEMENTS: All elements present but with uneven integration. STYLE: Lyrical prose prioritizes atmosphere over clarity. BREVITY: Length enhances poetic concision. REFLECTION: Themes linger but require unpacking. Cohesion scores moderate.</comment>
