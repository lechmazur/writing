<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited interiority and underdeveloped voice; motivation to "hold hope" feels abstract rather than earned through specific actions or contradictions in his role as undertaker.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on mystical logic rather than cause-effect; pacing uneven with rushed chamber revelation. Concept shapes direction but strains within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (copper coins, lapis ceilings) create haunting atmosphere; Persian palace fusion with neon constellations is evocative but occasionally self-consciously ornate.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (clock as imprisoned time, "placid ferocity") resonate; ending subverts expectation of hollow silence, leaves lingering meditation on hope's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but flirts with "buried artifact awakens" tropes; some phrases ("mourning pays taxes") feel strained rather than organic. Tone cohesive but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements forcedly assembled—Persian palace, tribal knowledge, clock—lack organic unity. Strength lies in poetic closure but concept-first construction weakens impact.</comment>
