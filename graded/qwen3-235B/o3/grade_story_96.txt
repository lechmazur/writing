<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character voice is vivid but motivation remains poetic abstraction rather than psychologically convincing drive. Reactions to objects lack emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progression via objects works conceptually but suffers from compressed logic in descent sequence. Resolution feels symbolic rather than structurally earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tactile imagery (cobwebs editing poems, thyme/ink scent) creates immersive metaphysical space. Timeframe blurs but atmosphere remains compelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering around creativity's hunger works, but emotional climax lacks visceral impact. Ending risks pretentiousness over profundity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally veers into baroque overdescription. Some phrases ("reluctant hearts") border on formulaic anthropomorphism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Element integration is clever but strained at points. Poetic quality survives brevity yet thematic weight feels unevenly distributed.</grade>
