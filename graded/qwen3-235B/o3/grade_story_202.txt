<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation aligns with 'test gravity' and 'code of instinct' but lacks emotional depth; 'careful poisoner' trait is present yet underdeveloped in psychological complexity. The 'innocently guilty' paradox is atmospheric but not fully integrated into action or introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows seamlessly through interconnected waypoints; cause-effect logical within tight word count. Pacing brisk but never rushed. Climax and resolution feel inevitable despite surreal elements. Only minor disruption in guard reaction timing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with sensory-rich details (meteorite filings' smell, tactile dust). Atmosphere of 'dusty starlight' permeates every description, creating tonal unity. Objects feel thematically charged, not decorative. Near-perfect environmental storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ('gravity as stern parent,' 'world as spinning coin') elevate narrative. Ending's 'fall upward' resonates thematically. Subtext about self-authentication and controlled vulnerability. Tension between order and chaos maintained throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh combinations avoid clich√© ('baby comets' for squeaking wheels, 'space-filtered powder'). No artificial phrasing or tonal shifts. Poetic yet purposeful language; even surreal elements serve theme. Only slight overreliance on 'whispering' motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interwoven organically, creating narrative greater than component parts. Tone consistent across all elements. Length feels intentionally cinematic rather than constrained. Lingering questions about poisoning-as-language concept enhance re-readability.</comment>
