<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Grindle's melancholy informs actions but lacks psychological complexity. Dialogue/voice minimal due to narrative style, weakening distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but the tea-leaf method strains credibility. Pacing effective but resolution feels rushed despite clever cause-effect between glyph and structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid steampunk details (brass girders, ballast constellations) create immersive atmosphere. Tonal contrast between brine/coolant and phosphorescent hope enhances emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (bells as "wet petals," tea-steam as time) create layered meaning. Ending avoids sentimentality; theme of synthesis between logic/ritual resonates through symbolic merging of glyph and stress diagram.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept combining steampunk mysticism with engineering pragmatism. Avoids clich√©s but risks ornate phrasing ("copper-leaf tea"). Tension between science/spirit feels engineered but not forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong individual elements cohere, but brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of themes. Lingering question about systemic vs symbolic solutions feels intentional rather than accidental.</comment>
