<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quill's transformation is poignant, but motivations feel underexplored beneath lush descriptions; rigidity-to-resilience arc feels somewhat schematic despite poetic renderings of internal shift.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot moves cohesively through symbolic actions, but the "quiet transformation" payoff strains plausibility within tight structure; Tesla bulb's narrative weight stretches thin in 500-word framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Viscerally atmospheric setting merges Gothic decay and mystical precision; gravestone hill as living textural metaphor elevates every scene with spectral semantic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density impresses but occasionally obscures emotional truth; the "twin constellations" line risks overcooked abstraction despite poignant subtext about archiving human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original mythopoeic premise undermined by occasional purple prose ("smeared the hilltop stones like half-erased sentences") and slightly algorithmic character transitions masked by lyrical flow.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Element integration strong but uneven; some plot machinery shows through the faery-laden veneer, though the bulb's symbolic through-line justifies its brevity-constrained architecture.</comment>
