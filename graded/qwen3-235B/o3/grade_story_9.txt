<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and consistent, but motivation lacks emotional complexity beyond abstract defiance. Sarcastic tone risks undermining depth of existential stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric parable but sacrifices intimate human scale. Conceptual ambition occasionally overshadows emotional authenticity, yet lingers provocatively.</comment>
