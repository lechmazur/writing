<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivations exist as thematic concepts rather than humanized drives, with internal conflict stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coherent structure with symbolic resolution, but narrative momentum feels compressed - key emotional beats and logistical transitions occur too abruptly within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Breathtaking sensory cohesion; every setting element (colors, silence, architecture) interlocks to create an immersive, mythic environment where each physical detail reflects psychological and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Poetic devices (e.g. "censorious eye," "syllable tasted of guilt") create haunting imagery, but thematic weight occasionally tips into abstraction at expense of narrative momentum and emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original metaphoric language avoids clich√© ("time held its breath"), though some passages risk overwrought abstraction. Psychological logic emerges organically rather than formulaically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine with impressive thematic unity - each assigned component contributes meaningfully to central tension between sacred taboos and transformative knowledge.</comment>
