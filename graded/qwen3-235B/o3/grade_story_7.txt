<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Main character has vivid physical descriptions but lacks emotional depth; motivations about dolls' healing are clear but personal stakes underdeveloped; reactions to key objects (cane/vats) reveal some complexity but remain impressionistic rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows mythic hero journey template; cause-effect between star paths and machinery works symbolically but lacks mechanical logic; tight arc from entrance to boundary-crossing succeeds in word limit but hurried resolution of siphon threat feels contrived; ending sacrifices narrative closure for lyrical impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stellar ambiance created through synesthetic details (copper honey taste, velvet heart texture); timelessness of "pre-prayer" hour juxtaposes industrial setting beautifully; facility's machinery behaving like celestial instruments maintains coherence; lacks contextualization of how this world connects to wider cosmos despite ending.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphor density elevates story above genre pulp; choir-of-healing concept connects micro (doll restoration) and macro (galactic knitting); subtext on cost of compassion emerges through "unevenly mended" fractures; overreliance on adjective-heavy descriptions occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid inventiveness in "centrifuged nebulae" and "sleeping universes" but some phrases like "splinters like mercy learned from storms" verge on algorithmic juxtaposition; metaphors remain cohesive despite ornate style; lacks emotional ambiguity - all feelings are externalized into setting rather than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements work collectively to create mytho-industrial tone poem; brevity serves poetic aims but weakens narrative stakes; thematic throughline about fractured restoration holds disparate parts together; ending's conceptual resonance outweighs underdeveloped conflict with siphons.</comment>
