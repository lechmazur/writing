<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear arc, but pivotal moments (e.g., daughter’s shift from guilt to collaboration) feel rushed and underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting has evocative imagery (e.g., "sugar glass") but rebellion’s influence on daily life and atmosphere remains superficially sketched.</comment>
