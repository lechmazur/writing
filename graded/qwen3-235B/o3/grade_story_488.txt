<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's motivations are poetic but vague; actions lack psychological depth despite assigned elements. Voice remains consistent but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure works conceptually but feels rushed; cause-effect between time/place-shattering is logical yet under-explained within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles with sensory overload ("corroded rapture," "overlap timelines") but some details (e.g., "rusted dunes") inconsistently serve plot logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and subtext about self-erasure elevate impact; emotional payoff from "applause, not answer" ending is intellectually satisfying but emotionally muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("salt rewound bullets," "doves of red dust") but occasionally indulges in purposeful obscurity that risks becoming its own trope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically around rebellion and self-destruction but some (quantum beach, family holiday) feel conceptually prioritized over narrative necessity.</comment>
