<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivations: Rigor's archival discipline vs Mara's rebellious theory-testing are distinct, sharply contrasted, and fully embodied in actions (ordered steps vs bramble-hacking). Their "voice" emerges through terse dialogue and physicality—visor-hiding grins, quip-revising—but lacks deeper psychological complexity that could elevate them beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Circular structure is satisfying: reset-championship/sinking-plinth symmetry. Pacing manages to build tension within word limits (quicksand climax arrives just before 3/4 mark), but the interlude of "seeing futures" risks overwhelming coherence—though the metaphor "carpools in traffic" resolves it neatly as thematic anchor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Olfactory and auditory details (cricket-score chirps, damp map) ground the reader. The "dying lantern" and neon-halo torches are evocative metaphors. Bioluminescent lilies popping underfoot is tactile and visual brilliance that enhances the eerie yet whimsical tension—but the swamp's ecology remains sketchy, leaving atmospheric potential unfulfilled.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>The "rural legend fossilizing into matter" conceit is original and thematically rich. Literary devices (scoreboard/double heartbeat imagery) are purposeful. Ending’s cyclical reset feels earned rather than gimmicky. Subtext about authorship of reality—through the archivists' pact—lingers provocatively without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids most genre tropes: the meet-cute isn't sentimentalized; scholarly conflict isn't reducible to "logic vs passion." The "vision of intersecting lives" risks cliché but is elevated by the "carpool" metaphor. No purple prose, though phrases like "lamp-lit aisle" occasionally miss sharper specificity. Nuanced emotional subtext (hidden grin) over explicit tells.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are woven with seeming effortlessness—the "scoreboard reset" both begins and closes the narrative; the fossil isn't just a quest-object but literalizes the theme. Leaves the reader debating whether legends shape us or we shape them—a resonant tension sustained throughout. Length feels masterfully curated rather than constrained.</comment>
