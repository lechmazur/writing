<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character defined more by poetic imagery than internal consistency; motivations implied through ritual rather than coherent psychological arcs. Feral traits lack integration with deeper behavioral logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative flow exists but remains fragmented; pivotal action (scale balancing) resolved too abstractly to satisfy traditional plot mechanics despite lyrical momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully constructed through sensory alchemy, though setting occasionally prioritizes lush description over organic narrative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through metaphor and symbolism, yet struggles to fully realize subtextual weight beneath its own lyrical surface; ending lingers but lacks narrative teeth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps with fresh imagery, though some phrasing (e.g., "half-remembered lullaby") skirts clich√©; emotional impact relies heavily on atmospheric density over character nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious and conceptually cohesive, but integration of structural elements lacks the surgical precision required for seamless miniature epic format.</comment>
