<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weak character depth; motivation presented but not explored through conflict or emotional nuance. Verin functions more as a narrative device than a living character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure functional but predictable. The "unspoken offer" climax achieves closure, but pacing inconsistencies and compressed timeline weaken cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly rendered through specific sensory details (murk, wine taste, torch shadows), though the "reimagined Viking" setting occasionally feels like costume drama rather than cultural integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegance in metaphors ("ink like honey struck by lightning") and symbolic tapestry of human experience. Lacks sustained emotional investment despite lyrical writing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in archiving emotions through physical ink/tears and the "unspoken offer" mechanism. Some phrases border on poetic abstraction but avoid outright purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrated with creativity but uneven execution. The vignette-like nature works thematically, though the ending feels more like a stylistic flourish than earned resolution.</comment>
