<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's "reliably unreliable" trait is intriguing but underexplored. Motivation to reclaim cultural heritage is clear, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level despite poetic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot uses tight constraints effectively, but the oracle's abrupt arrival and the holographic resolution rely heavily on whimsical convenience rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush sensory details create vivid atmosphere (glowing studio, peppermint/thunder scent), with setting and timeframe beautifully merged to heighten tension through urgency and limited time.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("kink" as both door mechanism and thematic twist) and layered subtext about cultural resistance. Ending carries meaningful resonance rather than mere closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through inventive combinations (bus-ticket robes, holographic swallow recipes). Language remains purposeful and stylized without devolving into ornate excess or predictable phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically rather than feeling imposed - the tile's fragmentation mirrors fractured traditions, the kinked door becomes both literal event and symbolic turning point in a thoughtfully compressed narrative.</comment>
