<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lucia's fierce ambition and playfulness are consistently shown through her methods (tools, actions) but motivation for pursuing transcendental indoctrination lacks evolution. Assigned attributes shape her actions but not her psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The search for the costume drives action but the metaphysical payoff feels compressed. Pacing balances mystery with revelation but the leap from artifact retrieval to global consciousness feels unearned within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Zeppelin's drowned grandeur and radio static atmosphere merge seamlessly - decaying brass, letter-bubbles, and watery whispers create immersive paradox of "calm frenzy." Sensory details about costume inflation through imagination elevate the setting's dream logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Surreal metaphors ("bubbles shaped like letters," "diplomatic ballet") and layered subtext about truth's corrosive power create haunting resonance. Ending's implication of collective awakening via performance lingers powerfully. Few emotional shortcuts in text.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines through unconventional concepts (ink-like agendas, bubble epistles) but some phrases ("whimsey coaxed secrets", "storm-quiet") risk preciousness. Shifts between concrete details and cosmic themes occasionally strain believability despite ambitious vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock like clockwork despite brevity - the threadbare costume as temporal hinge, radio static bridges, methodical playfulness driving revelation. Final image of ascending divers with Lucia's underwater performance creates potent symbolic closure.</comment>
