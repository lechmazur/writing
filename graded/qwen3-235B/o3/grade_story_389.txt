<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is driven but underdeveloped; "thin-lipped" is superficial descriptor. Motivation clear, but emotional depth lacking. Actions align with hunger for knowledge, though reactions lack nuance. Voice is distinct in third-person but lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically, but pacing feels rushed in key transitions (e.g., ritual to vault). Action-method connection works but underexplored. Bookending with calendar flip is elegant, yet ending resolution is abrupt, weakening closure. Cause/effect relationships are mostly clear but strained in the final metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive: sensory details (dust, mildew, whale oil) ground the eerie, decaying setting. Timeframe (year's end) complements cyclical themes. Object-setting connection is strong (figurehead as relic within library mine). Tone is consistently haunting, with "confusing certainty" subtly woven into descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("knowledge beckoned like a feast") and symbolic imagery (mirror of library cards, fragmented treasures) elevate the craft. Ending lingers thematically (cost of obsession), but some ornate prose risks diluting impact. Subtext about knowledge-as-consumption is effective, though pacing hinders deeper tension development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with discredited textbooks and hybrid motifs. Some phrases flirt with overwrought description ("whale oil," "ebony teeth"), but original combinations (library-as-basalt-throne) feel inventive. Emotional resonance is implied through action over subtext. Tone remains consistent without formulaic shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements unite cohesively to explore destructive intellectual thirst. Story leverages brevity effectively, using dense imagery over exposition. Lingering impact stems from haunting themes, though density occasionally obscures clarity. Style serves ambition, but minor cuts could sharpen focus.</comment>
