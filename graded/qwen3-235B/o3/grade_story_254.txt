<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character’s humorless persona is well-established but motivations lack psychological depth; actions align with traits but emotional resonance remains distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from abstract pacing shifts; connections between daydreams and reality feel underresolved despite poetic imagery anchoring the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie, evocative details (wind, scorched parchment) masterfully amplify desolation; temporal vagueness complements existential tone without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal imagery and meta-humor avoids formula; lyrical abstraction occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting meditation on failure and art; brevity enhances gravity, leaving lingering questions about creativity and cosmic impermanence.</comment>
