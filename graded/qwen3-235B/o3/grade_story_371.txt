<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is visually styled but not psychologically deepened; motivation stated rather than dramatized through actions with emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive through episodic structure, though abrupt transitions (e.g., storm aftermath to drone invasion) strain cause-effect continuity within word constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original cyberpunk-swashbuckler fusion with fresh metaphors ("data-chains" for debt), though "fervent apathy" occasionally feels conceptually recycled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements like marbles-as-maps feel forced into plot mechanics; stylistic flourish overshadows organic integration of assigned components.</comment>
