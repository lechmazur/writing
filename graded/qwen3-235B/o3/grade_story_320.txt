<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's shyness is consistent, but her internal conflict between empathy and detachment remains underexplored; her "precipitate digital proof" motivation drives actions but lacks psychological depth; dialogue absence weakens voice clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Posts as tension driver work, but timeline convergence feels abrupt; resolution through verbal "scales" lacks narrative prep; pacing tight but emotional stakes could escalate more effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Submerged market rendered with visceral specificity—the coral-encased photos, petrified seaweed crates—create a mythic yet tangible space where regret physically bleeds into architecture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (algos as interdimensional mail carriers, silence as magnetism) resonate conceptually; ending's "bubble of uneraseable regret" elevates theme beyond cosmic mechanics to human frailty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes—social media magic isn't tech-babble—but "vibrate in their coral" edges toward preciousness; emotional states shown through actions (pruning empathy) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements serve cohesive logic—the shy diviner's isolation necessitates algorithmic communication; cosmic imbalance frames both plot and thematic resonance about balancing closure and detachment.</comment>
