<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character hints at depth through symbolic actions and motifs, but lacks full emotional grounding; motivations implied rather than earned through concrete psychological stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on surreal cause-effect logic; pacing uneven but forgivable in tight word count; structural arc clear despite compressed space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, original setting details (vacuum garden, fossilized footprints) masterfully blend sci-fi and decaying grandeur; atmosphere thickens through synesthetic descriptions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some lush phrasing borders on self-indulgence, but inventive combinations (engineering asteroids, vacuum gardens) transcend formulaic genre tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate elegantly thematically but unevenly in execution; surreal momentum sustains interest despite slight narrative fragmentation.</comment>
