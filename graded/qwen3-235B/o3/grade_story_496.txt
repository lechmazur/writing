<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually coherent as repressed poet, but lacks depth beyond symbolic gestures; motivation to "pen a cosmic verse" drives action but remains abstract, with inner conflict expressed through metaphor rather than embodied behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from discovery to collaboration, but the tight word limit creates rushed transitions (e.g., sudden arrival of stranger); cause-and-effect is logical but lacks emotional weight to anchor the transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and immersive, with tactile descriptions of decay and growth; the perfume bottleâ€™s "bruised" glass and "vegetal ruins" deepen atmosphere; sensory details anchor the surreal elements in a tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich imagery and symbolic layering (e.g., scent as liberation, writing as defiance) elevate the prose; the ending resolves with thematic resonance, though some metaphors verge on preciosity; emotional undertones are evoked but not fully earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in sensory specificity and fusion of poetic motifs; avoids cliche through inventive metaphors ("letters glowed faintly, refusing to settle"), but the "face wrapped in newspaper" leans toward familiar mystery tropes; prose is lush but occasionally self-conscious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story coheres around elemental tensions between repression and expression, but length constraints limit emotional investment; style elevates concept, yet the brief arc feels more like a vignette than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
