<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character voice exists but lacks depth; motivations shift abruptly from lost to enlightened without sufficient internal logic. Actions align with plot but feel undermotivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot arc present but compressed; some key transitions lack causal weight (e.g., sudden shuttle theft decision). Ending resolves thematically but feels telegraphed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting creates intriguing juxtapositions but relies on inconsistent imagery; some sensory details (antimatter blossoms) dazzle while others (ship mechanics) remain glossed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (cages, pruning) resonate thematically; ending achieves emotional lift-off but could deepen character-specific realization through more concrete sensory grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten phrasing ("dark matter mildew") and over-reliance on conceptual tension rather than lived-in worldbuilding. The shuttle escape's significance feels algorithmically tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptually rich but execution betrays procedural seams; poetic language sometimes obscures rather than reveals. Certain elements feel checklist-driven despite surface originality.</comment>
