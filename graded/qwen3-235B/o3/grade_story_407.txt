<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra’s unluckiness and scientific obsession are consistent but underdeveloped; her systematically chaotic approach shapes decisions but lacks human nuance in reasoning or emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing manages to establish arc within constraints, but resolution feels rushed; colliding clan conflicts introduced late and resolved mechanically via ritual spar.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich underground setting enhances atmosphere, but lizard culture’s chlorophyll dialects and "bitter honey" aren’t fully integrated into broader world logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., sextant as crescent blade) and nectar’s bittersweet symbolism elevate resonance; central theme of truth as cultural currency is compelling but unevenly deepened.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with lizard scholars and cosmic botany, but "systematically chaotic" remains surface-level; dialogue leans formulaic in climactic spar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive blend of elements, though some (e.g., atmospheric pressure’s role) feel decorative rather than transformative; premise elevates above average but lacks haunting permanence.</comment>
