<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elowen’s rebellious spark informs her actions but feels underexplored; Phoenix’s motivations align with theme but lack depth; dialogue/voice could be more distinct to solidify personalities</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot drives forward efficiently using the fortune cookie and tilt mechanics, though the climax resolution risks feeling overly convenient; pacing balances brevity and complexity</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive element integration (e.g., fortune cookie’s literal/figurative role) elevates cohesion; length feels purposeful; lingering thematic resonance about knowledge preservation</comment>
