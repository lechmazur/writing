<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are introduced but underdeveloped; "frenetic illusionist" label lacks sufficient behavioral manifestation. Motivation for secrecy remains opaque rather than evolving naturally. Voice oscillates between poetic self-awareness and narrative detachment without clear purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Blackout-driven action creates urgency but resolution feels truncated. Time travel mechanics are intriguing but transitions between eras could be smoother. The circular structure works conceptually, though the ending's abrupt shift to modern alarm systems disrupts poetic momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering with cedar/candlelight contrasts, evolving into synesthetic light descriptions. The tree ring setting becomes a sentient narrative force through vivid botanical imagery. Atmosphere perfectly mirrors thematic concerns about temporal layering.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphor density ("cards shuffled by thunder," "prisms quarrelling") elevates prose while maintaining narrative functionality. Ending balances poetic ambiguity with thematic payoff about intergenerational storytelling, though subtext about ecological memory could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Some forced anaphora ("radiant shifts...") and botanical personification risks poetic excess. Occasional phrase clusters feel slightly generative rather than deliberate. Emotional undercurrents shown effectively through object exchanges but psychological complexity remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Highly cohesive around time-bending themes despite structural complexity. Assigned elements occasionally strain against narrative flow (custodian backstory too conveniently resolved). The brief form works against full exploration of dual timelines but maintains conceptual elegance.</comment>
