<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character’s orchardist background informs both motivation and investigative methods, linking sensory memories to analytical skills. However, emotional depth feels occasionally overshadowed by ornate metaphor, diluting the rawness of personal trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot uses tight cause-effect (seal→turbulence→exposure) to maintain momentum within constraints. The resolution ties to the protagonist’s stated motivation, but the leap from paper airplanes to financial fraud strains plausibility marginally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blends industrial (paper airplane facility) and organic (orchard imagery) elements effectively, with strong olfactory/tactile details. Timeframe “throughout volunteering” lacks temporal specificity, leaving pacing slightly unmoored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storytelling excels with layered metaphors (peacock as audit tool) and thematic unity between personal loss and systemic corruption. Ending achieves emotional and thematic resonance through cyclical imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Demonstrates inventive use of unexpected juxtapositions (orchardist vs corporate fraud) without formulaic structures. Language balances precision with poetic flair; avoids overused tropes while maintaining clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements creates thematically rich narrative where no component feels superfluous. Concise form enhances the interplay between character history and present action.</comment>
