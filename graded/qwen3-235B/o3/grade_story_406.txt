<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent but archetypal; motivation (disguise mastery) is clear but lacks psychological depth beyond surface archetypes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</degree><comment>Tightly compressed yet logical; the time-travel resolution feels slightly rushed but maintains arc cohesion within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral, layered sensory details (hissing cauldrons, stained glass alembics) create immersive fantasy-noir fusion; atmosphere deepens thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "whispered apologies stitched like fabric") and subtext (reality control vs. self-reflection) elevate narrative; ending resonates with thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive hybridization (espionage-meets-magic); prose balances lyricism with precision, avoiding hollow ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements (button, time, ambition) interlock organically; the twist reframes spy tropes into philosophical commentary on legacy and authorship.</comment>
