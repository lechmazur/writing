<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's voice as 'social media exorcist' with 'indifferent enthusiasm' is distinct but underdeveloped. Motivation to feed curiosity with 'raw edge' feels stated rather than embodied through specific actions. Reactions to the receipt and 'familiar strangers' hint at depth but lack psychological nuance that would make them compelling or consistent beyond the surreal premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Action of 'reigniting' drives the plot effectively through ritualistic progression. Logical cause/effect between haunting, infiltration, and resurrection is maintained despite tight word count. Pacing tightens in corridor sequence but resolves with satisfying circularity to the 'final chord' framing. Concept of 'familiar strangers' shapes the plot's emotional core even if under-articulated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Abandoned mess hall rendered with vivid sensory details (mold, condensation, 'inaudible playlist') that amplify the eerie, algorithmic supernatural tone. Atmosphere of 'quietly loud' decay perfectly aligns with both physical setting and social media's paradoxical noise. Timeframe's 'after the final chord' silence enhances the haunting's urgency, though underexploited thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Impressive use of metaphor ('algorithms as incense', 'metrics spiking like souls clocking out') enriches subtext about digital-age spirituality. The ending's reflection on 'raw edges keep scrolling' elevates the theme beyond spectacle. Some telling weakens emotional impact, but the blend of ritual and livestreaming innovation creates lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten phrases ('condensation-puddled silhouettes') and predictable 'haunted internet' trope usage. Avoids becoming cliché through specific, original details like 'pigeon’s nest receipt' and 'spectral entrees'. Transitions between physical and digital spaces remain seamless despite surreal premises. Emotional range leans on irony rather than genuine pathos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements tightly but unevenly - 'receipt' and 'reignite' are masterstrokes, 'infiltrating clubs' feels tacked on. Tone and setting achieve memorable cohesion that elevates formulaic character beats. Brief length feels purposeful as concentrated meditation on modern ghost-hunting, though deeper exploration of 'familiar strangers' concept would strengthen thematic gravity.</comment>
