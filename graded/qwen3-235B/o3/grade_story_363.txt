<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Grieving miner's motivation is clear but underexplored; emotional weight is present but lacks nuanced human contradiction. Passive resolve against personal salvation feels forced rather than lived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Parade bookends and bell meditation create circular structure, but tight word count forces rushed transitions. Archaeological method drives plot effectively but lacks tangible stakes within compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere of obsolete technology and mourning is viscerally realized through scent (funeral lilies), sound (distant drums), and texture (soot). Secret society's lenses add specific visual strangeness without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors of entropy and memory resonate through tactile imagery (coal dust settling on bell, living paper ledgers). Ending merges triumph and lamentation subtly; mechanical progress vs. human cost is visceral rather than didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids AI-adjacent clich√©s through concrete details (carbide lamps, hammer-drills) rather than abstract machinery. Some phrases ("crude lantern slides") show fresh mechanical horror; tonal consistency maintained despite dense symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements like parade bookends, silent bell, and archival nightmare method serve thematic unity without feeling imposed. Lyrical compression works as deliberate aesthetic rather than limitation, leaving haunting aftertaste of encoded history.</comment>
