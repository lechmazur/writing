<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's impatience/patience duality is woven into actions and narration; motivation to preserve languages is clear but lacks deeper psychological exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot uses tight cause-effect (dare → action → escape) with clever integration of elements; structure feels complete within constraints despite minor exposition reliance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Futuristic setting is vivid and atmospherically distinct, though some sensory details lean synthetic; tone complements thematic melancholy of language extinction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and thematically resonant; metaphors ("chosen paths outgrow their walkers") elevate meaning; minor overreliance on dense imagery occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</comment>Unconventional fusion of sci-fi and linguistics feels inventive; avoids clichéd fugitive tropes but occasionally veers into self-conscious stylization that risks emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative; brevity enhances urgency; lingering questions about redemption and cultural preservation reward reflection.</comment>
