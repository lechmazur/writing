<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to unchain the muse is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with goal but lack emotional depth. "Melodic sculptor" concept is hinted at through stone-and-sound metaphors but remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has strong momentum through roadside greenhouse detour and glade arrival, but the compressed word count creates abrupt transitions. The muse's liberation feels rushed, and the resolution lacks resonance despite a complete arc structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric details (glowing pollen, tapping birds) immerse readers in a dreamlike reality. The dawn timeframe and glade setting are inseparable from the theme. Tactile descriptions occasionally border on excess but mostly enhance the mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and paradoxical imagery ("shouting silence," "song as sculpture") elevate the prose. The theme of artistic rebirth is coherent, though the ending leans on sentimental closure rather than earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strikes a balance between lyrical originality and risk of purple prose. The muse's stone-gray wings and orchestral marble are fresh, but some floral metaphors feel overwritten. Avoids clich√©s in concept but occasionally over-decorates execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven (e.g., botanical dew enabling journey), though the muse's weariness lacks contextual grounding. The brief length feels intentional but sacrifices some narrative breathing room. Leaves thematic questions, if not visceral impact.</comment>
