<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's grace and "mindfully scattered" nature are shown through actions, but motivation to escape suppression lacks emotional depth despite influencing plot; minimal dialogue hinders distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc from descent to rebirth, but pacing falters in middle with abrupt statue awakening; cosmic signal use strains logic despite driving plot; cause/effect connections feel strained under word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in underwater decay; atmosphere of claustrophobic wonder reflects tension between individuality/corruption; synthetic bird songs vs. real sky contrast deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking cosmic metaphors and subtext about creation/destruction duality; ending resonates thematically despite rushed climax; emotional impact undercut by overly ornate phrasing in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of drowned tech and cosmic mysticism; avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into purple prose; character psychology feels schematic rather than visceral despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of elements creates haunting whole; some mechanical seams show (e.g., eel power source), but thematic unity and lingering questions about individuality vs. legacy justify structural imperfections.</comment>
