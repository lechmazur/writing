<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated but not deeply internalized; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through actions. Hesitation surfaces in isolated gestures but lack consistent embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The crux of transformation relies on mystical reactions to objects rather than character-driven logic. Sudden aurora revelation lacks groundwork. Pacing is uneven: slow atmospheric buildup followed by rushed emergence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard’s paradoxical ecology and visceral frost-steam contrasts create immersive, symbolic terrain. Sensory details (geothermal clicks, visor specters) amplify dissonance between stagnation and change.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evokes melancholy and existential tension through metaphors of empty vessels and adaptive legacy. The postcard’s reactive ink and crab transference show subtextual ingenuity. Ending balances hope and ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in pairing hermit crabs with judicial tradition, but steam-as-judgment borders on poetic cliché. Avoids formulaic arcs through surreal logic, though “weight of tradition” metaphor leans familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain narrative mechanics (e.g., shell-switching → world-bridging). Leaves resonance in the crab’s trust motif, yet some details (inquiry chamber trauma) feel underexploited.</comment>
