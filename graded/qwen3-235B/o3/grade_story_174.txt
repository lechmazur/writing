<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth despite symbolic actions; motivation is clear but character remains sketchily defined despite poetic resonance of leaves and fireworks. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Non-linear progression feels deliberately cryptic but coherent; abrupt transitions (library to garage to festival) strain causality slightly within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion through metaphor (frost-scripted windshields, scintillating spines) creates eerie spirituality; setting is emotionally tactile and symbolically charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Layered symbolism (leaves as memory, frost as mutable truth) transcends plot; ending's silent fireworks and dissolved regret deliver poignant thematic closure. Vivid 'showing' dominates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Resists formulaic structures; car-window divination and chlorophyll ghosts feel inventively synesthetic rather than algorithmic; tone avoids ornate excess despite poetic density.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements unify into mythic coherence; leaves, frost, and regrets interlace thematically; brevity becomes strength through elliptical implication rather than underdevelopment.</comment>
