<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thalen's monk persona is established, but lacks depth; Mirva’s cynical warmth hints at complexity but remains underdeveloped; motivations are clear (Thalen’s cosmic capture, Mirva’s reluctant support of change), but deeper character evolution is sacrificed to word limits; dialogue has distinct voices but limited emotional range.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a compressed three-act structure effectively; key-testing drives forward momentum; cause/effect between crushing spheres and comet alignment is logical; pacing balances exposition and action; minor inconsistency: portal’s "dumping" risk feels tacked-on rather than earned by earlier tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting (dimension repair shop) is richly textured with sensory details (humming tension, ozone, misfired coils); time period of "radical change" contextualizes the comet’s stakes; atmosphere ("unbearable tension," "cynical warmth") enhances emotional undercurrents; shop’s haunted machinery creates cohesive mood; only weakness: violet sky’s cosmic event lacks physicality despite heavy thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Haunting metaphors ("borrowed pain is lighter than my own") and imagery ("sleeves releasing lantern sparks") elevate emotional impact; theme of trust forged through shared labor resonates; subtext connects cosmic fleetingness to human impermanence; ending balances resolution (portal stability) and mystery (Thalen’s next village); show-don’t-tell is generally strong, though some told emotions ("bruised optimism") persist.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Few clichés; metaphors fresh ("comet like a wish half-spent") but occasionally borders on purple prose ("haunted melodies fluttering like wounded birds"); avoids AI logic-patterns (subtle trust-building via technical collaboration); inconsistent emotional specificity (pride "disguised as irritation" works, "regrets of starfarers" feels more abstract); tone remains cohesive despite stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All assigned elements integrate cohesively; mechanical-conceptual pairing (repairing doors to access cosmos) inventive rather than forced; style favors poetics over minimalist clarity but serves the theme; short length emphasizes temporal urgency; leaves lingering question: can change be negotiated? Not quite groundbreaking, but thoughtfully executed.</comment>
