<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's traits are poetically rendered but lack psychological depth; motivation is symbolic rather than emotionally crystallized. The plush dinosaur and 'shyly loud' attribute shape action but feel conceptually abstracted rather than behaviorally concrete. Narrative voice is distinct but stylized to the point of distancing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic trajectory but lacks causal urgency; mending tapestry through time-fragments creates circular logic. Pacing is lyrical but amorphous—resolution feels imposed rather than earned. Connection between 'year everyone would forget' and dream-hopping method remains under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting exists as intoxicating metaphor first, narrative ecosystem second: 'future-drunk circuitry,' 'bronze coffins on stilts' create haunting sensory dissonance. Xenon-lit tunnel transcends atmosphere to become active participant, though its temporal physics remain ambiguously defined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story excels in lyrical invention: 'harp-string quivers,' 'lung built of constellations' offer transcendent imagery. Ending resonates thematically with bittersweet ambiguity. Deeper emotional engagement is undercut by pervasive abstraction; subtext leans heavy on capitalized Concepts rather than human-scale stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but occasionally drowns in its own poetic diction—'prehistoric sigh' risks preciousness. Original metaphors ('motivating sleeping minds') dazzle but accumulate toward self-contained myth rather than universal resonance. Emotional palette remains more intellectualized than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coheres as literary artifact more than narrative organism. Elements combine into striking mosaic, but tension between formal ambition and emotional immediacy persists. The 'hesitant bard' framework serves poetic logic over psychological realism, prioritizing allegorical momentum above all.</comment>
