<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's contradictory traits (recklessness/logic-emotion) are consistent and drive decisions, but deeper exploration of his smuggler past or Nomad mistrust would strengthen motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight structure within constraints, but the mirror-child revelation feels rushed; the clover's moral weight is introduced but not fully excavated before resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere with sensory cohesion; ultraviolet fields, spectral funhouse decay, and "sighing" structure immerse readers in a mythic, eerie world perfectly aligned with the theme of crossing boundaries.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (fraying map, synchronized heartbeats) and interplay of jubilant despair evoke layered resonance; ending balances triumph and melancholy, though dialogue occasionally leans on conceptual cleverness over emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>Prose avoids clich√©s with fresh imagery ("jubilant despair," "serpentine corridors"), but synchronized watch alarms border on sci-fi contrivance; emotional subtext (stealing child's hope) adds nuance over formulaic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements cohesively serve theme of belonging through sacrifice; brevity feels intentional, with the bittersweet ending lingering as a meditation on distance and connection in human bonds.</comment>
