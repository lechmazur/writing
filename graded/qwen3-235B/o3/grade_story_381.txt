<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment> Veyla's quiet necromancy shapes her interactions with the cave, but Orren remains a static foil. Their contrasting motives (protection vs. ambition) are clear, though Orren's development leans on clichéd selenologist quirks. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> The hum's evolution from sound to negotiator drives the plot, but the transition to the crevasse's softening feels abrupt. The cyclical structure (starting/ending with resolve) works, though pacing near the climax strains under poetic flourishes. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment> The crystalline cave's sensory details—neon ghosts, glowing stalactites, resonant hum—are visceral and thematically cohesive. The setting actively participates in the narrative rather than merely hosting it. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment> The metaphor of old films as necromancy and the cave as a coauthor deepen the theme. The ending avoids closure, amplifying the tension between conquest and collaboration. Subtext about listening vs. dominating resonates. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment> Avoids genre tropes by merging necromancy with geology, but phrases like "phosphorescent lines ribboned" verge on ornate. The baseball cap-as-offering avoids cliché, though "futuristic nostalgia" feels more curated than earned. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment> Elements like the cave's sentience, the necromantic cartography method, and the cinematic framing interlock inventively. The brevity enhances the enigmatic tone, though the "futuristic nostalgia" motif could be sharper. </comment>
