<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's "strongly weak" paradox lacks depth, with inconsistent emotional nuance beyond surface traits. Motivation ties to the assigned object but personal stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves methodically through legend-collection, but transitions between tales feel abrupt. Resolution satisfies structurally but slightly underdevelops consequences of the elders' transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting's hybrid aesthetic (chrome/ivy) and sensory details immerse effectively, though deeper integration of Celtic elements with the urban legends would strengthen cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the narrative; ending resonates thematically. Emotional subtext lingers but some poetic phrasing risks over-decoration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original reimagining avoids genre tropes with its ink pot as courage-antidote and revision-festival concept. Language borders on ornate but retains purposeful imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole, though "jubilant despair" feels intermittently emphasized. Brevity works for thematic punch, but tighter pacing in middle could improve flow.</comment>
