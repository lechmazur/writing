<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's naive hopefulness is central to his actions, but deeper exploration of his backstory or internal conflicts could strengthen motivation consistency and distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot moves efficiently to sabotage the Machine, but the ending feels abrupt, leaving the thematic resolution underdeveloped despite clever use of the "syncing frequencies" method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich descriptions of the orchard (glowing fruit, "oily dew") and the surreal Machine create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that deeply supports the narrative’s tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (absence vs. excess) and lyrical metaphors elevate the story, though occasional overwrought phrasing ("agonizing bliss") slightly dilutes emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the Machine’s concept and the jigsaw edge’s symbolism, but some ornate descriptions border on purple prose, and the resolution leans on familiar "sacrifice to heal" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into the narrative, with the brief length enhancing tension. The ending’s thematic ambiguity is deliberate but could feel more earned.</comment>
