<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Isamu's reserved nature and indirect influence through herbs are consistent, but Aya's motivations remain opaque beyond surface cues like thundercloud-silence; her transformation feels slightly mechanical despite poetic execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements like pigments and meteors work symbiotically, though the art class timeframe's role feels secondary; the story's ethereal concept lingers as a haunting contemplation on unspoken truths.</comment>
