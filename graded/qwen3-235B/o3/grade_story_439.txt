<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Limited because motivation (escape through hidden meanings) remains abstract rather than visceral; Quill's muteness is a trait rather than a transformative force in decisions; Lady Portena lacks interiority despite haunting presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure exists but pacing feels compressed; cause/effect logic holds (comet → guide → portal) but emotional beats are underdeveloped; plot leans heavily on poetic imagery substituting for narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through specific sensory details (chandeliers chiming like frozen bells, seagulls in broken dress circle); setting actively generates thematic momentum rather than merely housing action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (doorframes flickering between wings/gates) and symbolic action (chalk constellations), but emotional resonance remains detached; ending achieves poetic resonance but psychological impact feels muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in combining opera house-as-observatory conceit and comet-as-conductor; avoids genre clichés through inventive physicalization of abstract concepts; occasional over-ornamentation ("runes of ice") slightly undermines clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere remarkably given density of required components; style balances lyrical prose with narrative purpose; themes of escape/perception linger, though emotional weight feels withheld.</comment>
