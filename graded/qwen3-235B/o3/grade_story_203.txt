<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is partially implied (aunt's dying wish, preserving truth), but emotional depth remains understated. The stage fright trait influences her method but isn't fully explored as a transformative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but feels compressed; beginning/end connection is conceptually sound (voice → transformation) yet lacks intermediary emotional beats. Assigned elements drive the plot but cohere through symbolic logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</comment> comment>Worldbuilding is vivid yet sometimes hyperbolic ("jagged halo softened into gardens")—sensory details like radiation-wrapped flowers and pollen mapping constellations create immersive atmosphere, though occasional overdescription distracts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and original metaphors (e.g., "metal rememb[ering] it was once a root") elevate impact. Subtext—truth vs. lies—resonates, though the ending leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, but some phrases ("germinate futures," "living sky") risk becoming flowery clichés. Balance between fresh imagery and self-indulgence is uneven at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively into a thematically resonant whole, though certain details (e.g., "miniature plastic rockets") feel underexploited. The ending lingers but could better anchor abstract themes.</comment>
