<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Quillon's boredom and shifting ability lack depth beyond thematic representation; Vess is vividly sketched but remains a foil. Motivations align with traits but lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise drives plot effectively, but word constraints strain cause/effect transitions (e.g., throne interaction). Pacing is uneven; coherence maintained through poetic continuity rather than structured beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details immerse readers; post-empire setting and harmonic caves synergize with tone. Object-environment connections (figurine, throne) deepen atmospheric resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Provocative metaphors ("wrong-way knees"), layered theme of overthrow-as-possibility, and resonant closing image create lasting impact. Subtextual exploration of power and entropy elevates beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in cosmic-scale metaphors and intentional paradoxes ("overthrow nothing and everything"). Avoids genre tropes but occasionally sacrifices precision for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements synergize to create thematic unity despite brevity; tone/style sustain cohesive vision. Episodic structure leverages constraints while leaving room for deeper exploration.</comment>
