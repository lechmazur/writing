<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character traits like aloofness and curiosity drive key actions, but interpersonal reactions lack depth; motivations crystallize late, diluting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear arc anchored by the logbook, but pacing stumbles—turbine activation feels rushed, undermining stakes despite logical cause-effect flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory immersion in decayed industrial port is vivid, but the "wounded season" timeframe feels underexploited, relying on generic melancholy rather than specific climate or social cues.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (machines "reclaiming power") and tactile prose elevate theme/thrill of discovery; ending opts for poignancy over subtext, weakening lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps—turbine’s purpose isn’t just "green energy" trope—but strained logic in crane/crate delay feels artificial; avoids overly ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tight weaving of most elements (logbook, turbine), but "predictably odd" trait and abrupt delay hinge on contrivance rather than organic design; ending lingers conceptually.</comment>
