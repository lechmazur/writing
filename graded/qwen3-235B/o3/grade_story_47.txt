<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation ties logically to plot but lacks deeper emotional nuance; "eagerly jaded" trait feels somewhat underexplored as a driving force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to resolution, though time compression strains believability; the triangle riddle solution lacks sufficient setup for immediate payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting functions as character itself, with cathedral's decay and sacredness permeating every sensory detail; atmosphere enhances both tone and thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "digital confetti" and "vocal pitch vs courage" elevate narrative; ending resonates thematically but minor characters remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through genre-blending (sacred/gothic/detective), but some phrases ("trapped moth") border on trope; emotional beats shown more than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Elements cohere into unified whole despite brevity; the joke-as-resolution feels both surprising and inevitable, though some connections rely heavily on reader interpretation.</comment>
