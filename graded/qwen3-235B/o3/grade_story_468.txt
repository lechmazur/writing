<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marlow’s curiosity as a mortician drives the plot but lacks psychological depth; motivations are coherent but underexplored, reducing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tight structure with a clear arc within constraints; progress feels linear but occasionally rushed, particularly in resolution phases.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere with layered sensory details (e.g., ozone-jasmine scent, luminescent footprints) that vividly anchor the uncanny setting and tone.</comment>
