<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks sufficient inner conflict exploration; backstory feels compressed. Sharp gentleness is illustrative but not fully dramatized through actions. Motivation for cosmic reconciliation remains underdeveloped despite clear exile rationale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prologue-like pacing uneven; holographic map resolution feels rushed. Connection between "between channels" and narrative turning point insufficiently earned. Interstellar corridor revelation lacks incremental foreshadowing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exquisite textile-based worldbuilding (pennant code, meteorite dust diary) creates tactile wonder. Lavender clouds verge on aesthetic overkill. Wind-flag mechanics brilliantly translate abstract concepts into physical storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (compass hesitation = human hesitation, void love = redemption) resonate. Unanswered question about erased stories' agency lingers powerfully. Emotional beats conveyed through symbolic acts rather than felt experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original pairing of matchmaking algorithms and cosmic navigation. Some phrases ("gentle lacerations of truth") flirt with pretension. Avoids most AI-writing tics but occasionally favors poetic abstraction over narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements synergize into cohesive existential quest. Overreliance on thematic symmetry (silence/absence=revelation) strains plausibility. The "400-500 word poem dressed as flash fiction" structure enhances rather than hinders.</comment>
