<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elowen and Lysander are defined by their assigned traits but lack multidimensionality; their motivations are clear yet underexplored, relying on poetic implication rather than lived emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; cause-and-effect is logical yet occasionally abstract, with the rain-pattern method introduced but not fully dramatized within the strict word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile descriptions (e.g., "moonlight dripped like quicksilver," glowing rain) create a haunting atmosphere; setting and concept are inseparable, enhancing sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and resonant symbolism elevate the story, though emotional resonance leans on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete character reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the rain-pattern premise and cosmic-historical synthesis; avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornateness ("universe lean[ing] nearer"), risking overwrought prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; some narrative gaps and brevity limit deeper exploration, but imaginative ambition aligns with the concise format.</comment>
