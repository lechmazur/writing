<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned mildness contrasts poorly with his decisive actions; motivations toward cultural preservation are stated but lack emotional depth or personal stakes beyond abstract duty.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work conceptually but rely on underexplained leaps (schoolhouse equations' relevance); coherence maintained through strong thematic throughline despite compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Retro-futurism executed with striking sensory specifics (glyphs, humming coils); atmosphere masterfully contrasts technological sterility against analog resistance, though some details border on excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering of mathematics as ancestral language and dice as cultural embers elevates narrative; ending transcends plot to pose philosophical questions about preservation vs. progress.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of frontier and sci-fi tropes avoids predictability; occasional purple prose ("fizzing lights") and overly poetic descriptors slightly undermine stylistic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock through recurring motifs (circuits/whispers/chalk); economy of storytelling within constraints achieves thematic weight despite minor pacing awkwardness in exposition.</comment>
