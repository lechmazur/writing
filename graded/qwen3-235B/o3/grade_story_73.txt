<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Mateo’s "steadiness" lacks psychological depth, reducing him to a symbolic vessel rather than a fully realized person with nuanced contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritual arc with clear coherence, but the resolution feels abrupt and under-earned, relying on poetic abstraction over narrative logic despite strong atmospheric setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through synesthetic details (neon/holographs, spectral graves), creating a hauntingly liminal space where tech-era decay merges with mythic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Language achieves lyrical potency through precise metaphors (e.g., "photons weighing loyalties") and layered symbolism, though occasional abstraction dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés via myth-tech fusion but occasionally falters into ornate abstraction ("breathed obsidian"); subversion of AI-tropes is partial but present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres as a self-contained aesthetic experience but feels constrained by its conceptual scaffolding; strengths lie in prose rather than structural innovation.</comment>
