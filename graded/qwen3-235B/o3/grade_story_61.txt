<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Queen Elendra's disenchanted resolve drives the plot, but her internal logic remains symbolically abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Her timid boldness is shown through action but lacks nuance in motivation shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight structure within constraints, with the prism's hurl as pivotal action. Causality is clear but some transitions (e.g., cosmic hush splintering) feel abrupt in realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Richly textured fungal world with synesthetic details (glowing slime, silent chimes) creates immersive atmosphere. Setting actively shapes emotional and narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (mycelial resonance, prism sacrifice) elevates thematic depth. Ending delivers emotional payoff through cosmic connection. Dense prose occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original mythopoeic elements avoid genre tropes, though some phrases ("feral harmonies") flirt with abstraction. Emotional beats feel earned rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified allegory about creation through loss. Compression enhances mystical tension but slightly undermines character depth.</comment>
