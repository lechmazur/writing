<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (critical, midwife, openly secretive) shape surface aspects but lack deeper psychological exploration; motivation (recover stolen memories) drives plot but reactions to elements like the herbs or diaries feel symbolic rather than personal; inner conflict hinted but not fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Via the diaries/herbs, the action drives plot effectively, though ascent via smoke ladder feels narratively convenient; beginning and end connect thematically (calm vs. storm) but word constraints strain the arc's emotional payoff; pacing uneven during memory revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (maelstrom, orchard island, waxing moon) and atmosphere merge seamlessly: the storm mirrors Ysolde’s internal chaos, while vivid sensory details (herbs, trembling leaves) immerse readers; the diaries’ embers and cyclonic stars enhance mood without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery (maelstrom as “sky-drown,” herbs as “aniseed dreams”) and metaphor (wisdom as erosion) elevate the narrative; ending’s thematic resonance (“remember louder”) feels earned, though emotional beats could be more nuanced; subtext on judgment vs. empathy lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original use of mystical tropes (maelstrom, diaries) avoids cliché, though phrases like “hollowed heart” lean familiar; tone remains consistent; avoids overt purple prose but some metaphors (“ladder of soft light”) risk sentimentality; character’s transformation leans symbol-heavy over humanly nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrate cohesively, though their symbolic weight occasionally overshadows narrative logic; brevity prioritizes atmosphere over character depth; style is distinctive and thematically purposeful, leaving a lingering impression of emotional and philosophical resonance.</comment>
