<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prominent metaphors don't sufficiently anchor character interiority; the fisher's "impossibility" lacks psychological dimensionality beyond mythic function, and protagonist's transition from "grudging admiration" to alliance relies on narrative assertion rather than behavioral evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ritualistic unraveling provides structural spine but causes/effects within tight arc remain abstract; sacred minute requirement lacks concrete stakes, while inward-pointing map resolution feels conceptually elegant yet dramatically inert within limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse decay as metaphor for memory preservation succeeds spectacularly through immersive sensorial layering (mist clinging like memory, brittle quilt textures), but baby lullaby timeframe remains atmospheric garnish rather than temporal anchor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Linguistic alchemy ("wisdom disguised as the listener's breath") and self-rewriting map achieve lyrical profundity, though emotional impact diluted by minimal character embodiment; thematic cohesion between illusion, extinction, and inner cartography is intellectually thrilling but psychologically distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transcends formula through unexpected connections (wristband as living pledge, tides reading minds), avoiding predictable mysticism tropes; dense metaphoric language borders on ornate but maintains originality through tactile specifics (cotton absorption, tide-small smile).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Creative element synthesis enhances thematic depth, particularly the quilt's interactive mapping, though some assigned components (logically absurd requirement) remain conceptually provocative but under-dramatized within brief scope.</comment>
