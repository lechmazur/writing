<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation but underdeveloped internal conflict; traits like jumpiness manifest superficially through frequent physical gestures without deeper psychological exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear progression strained by condensed format; key beats connected but climax feels truncated, while cause-effect dynamics (soul harvesting, NPC liberation) are broadly sketched rather than tightly plotted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory synthesis of "retro" and "pixelated" imagery creates immersive, paradoxical beauty; flickering torches and syncopated footsteps amplify tension through game-world logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thematic resonance between mythic structure and digital decay transcends gimmickry; subtext about power and complicity emerges through metaphorically rich details like "memory persistence" and "collision box" imprisonment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of coding and folklore avoids genre tropes; metaphors like "binary teardrops" and "hexadecimal scream" feel inventive rather than algorithmic, though some rhythmic overreliance on semicolon-separated clauses emerges.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through game-world logic despite formal constraints, balancing high-concept stakes with emotionally grounded moments (e.g., confetti flinch); certain plot devices feel schematic rather than organic.</comment>
