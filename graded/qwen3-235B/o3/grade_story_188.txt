<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hideki’s internal conflict and cyclical trauma are hinted with specificity, but his emotional depth remains surface-sketched despite poetic flourishes; motivation to escape violence lacks layered psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves with efficient, almost geometric precision despite word constraints; causal links are logical but some transitions (e.g., assassins' sudden surrender) strain plausibility within tight arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is tactile and immersive, blending decay with rebirth (metallic rain vs. rice seeds); corroded rapture manifests through vivid contrasts in sensory detail (e.g., "bright as rice-field water under moon").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ending resonates thematically through subversion of expected violence; armor poetry as metaphor elevates conflict beyond plot mechanics, though subtext occasionally veers toward didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unconventional imagery (e.g., "cycles shatter like a lacquer bowl") but dips toward purple prose in atmospheric descriptors; maintains individuality despite moments of stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a cohesive, evocative whole; brevity feels intentional, with narrative density suggesting untold layers; themes of repair and legacy linger post-reading.</comment>
