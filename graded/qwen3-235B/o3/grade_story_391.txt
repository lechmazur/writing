<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character has intriguing contradictions and consistent motivations, but lacks emotional depth in key moments; voice is distinct but occasionally overshadowed by lush prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with satisfying cause-effect, though the compressed arc feels slightly rushed in its resolution; the piano sequence is compelling but leaves some transitions ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with immersive sensory details; surreal elements like coral cities and manta shadows enhance the thematic tension between oppression and awakening.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (piano as metaphor for suppressed thought) and subtext; ending resonates thematically, though some phrases (e.g., "hairline crack in the crown") border on on-the-nose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in fusion of mythic and mechanical (guard static, organic conductor); avoids clich√©s through precise imagery and unpredictable combinations; stylistic flourishes are purposeful, not excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere seamlessly into a thematically rich narrative; brevity enhances poetic impact; the story lingers as a haunting parable about collective memory and resistance.</comment>
