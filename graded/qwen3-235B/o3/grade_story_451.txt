<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are functional but lack depth; motivations are clear but underexplored. Liora's desperation is shown through actions but not internalized nuance, while Selene's exposition-heavy dialogue weakens organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels compressed; key developments rely on exposition. Pacing falters in balancing setup and climax, with the ritual resolution feeling abrupt despite adequate cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("crystal shadows," "luminous constellations") create atmosphere, but sensory details are unevenly applied. The mountain's mystique strengthens tone, while the market's role remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (mirror warping, "cosmic wildfire") enhance thematic resonance, but the ending lacks lingering emotional impact. Themes of rewriting fate are hinted but not fully unpacked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mixes fresh and clich√©d elements: time-travel baseball is inventive, but apocalyptic prophecies, psychic twins, and "splicing timelines" lean on genre tropes. Some overly ornate phrasing detracts from clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of elements with room for tighter cohesion. The concise format highlights creativity but rushes thematic and emotional payoff; the central metaphor of the baseball as a fate-record is compellingly utilized.</comment>
