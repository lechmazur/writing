<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are interwoven with poetic metaphors but lack sufficient psychological complexity; "tense bodyguard" trait is thematically consistent but doesn't evolve beyond its initial conceptual presentation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc compressed into tight word constraints with minor pacing unevenness; cause-effect logic holds despite compressed exposition, though some transitions feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid lunar atmosphere with strong tactile details (misters, dust), but geopolitical context of the setting remains underexplored, slightly weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional control of metaphor ("serene anger... guiding star") and thematic cohesion; the interplay of memory and rebellion lingers long after reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi and literary elements avoids genre tropes; occasional lyrical density risks preciousness but never fully crosses into purple prose territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Masterful interplay between constraint and creativity; each element actively contributes to thematic tension rather than feeling checklist-driven, while maintaining emotional resonance.</comment>
