<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (personal demons, belonging) are clear but psychological shifts feel slightly rushed; Milo's 'voice' is consistent but interiority remains cryptic rather than deeply empathetic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically despite condensed form; the improv show as escape mechanism is clever but the emotional pivot from stage to tower relies on convenient metaphysical resonance</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory fusion of mechanics and magic (cracked gears/Ferris wheel voids) creates haunting atmosphere; the 'metaphysically physical' permeates setting and theme beautifully</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (demons dissolving through laughter) and cyclical structure elevate impact; ending risks sentimentality but avoids it through concrete imagery (seat as possibility)</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; carnival-as-mind-space concept feels original; emotional subtext emerges through action rather than stating; resists genre clich√©s with surreal yet purposeful logic</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements organically cohere into singular vision; the short form serves thematic compression rather than restricts; lingers with symbolic weight of abandoned blueprints becoming collaborative</comment>
