<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (belonging "even if nowhere") aligns tightly with actions—deserter status justifies secrecy, mask-reconstruction reveals fractured identity. Internal conflict manifests through concrete objects (shards, kiln). Subtle reactions (oxygen burst coinciding with confession) suggest emotional resonance without overstatement. Voice remains evocative yet restrained in third-person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from desertion to carbonization, with kiln scene resolving surveillance tension. Method of mask-story reconstruction drives both data collection and character introspection. Pacing condenses themes of cyclical identity without feeling rushed; plant reactions as "heartlike spikes" maintain cause-effect logic. Slight abruptness in vine farewell doesn’t disrupt momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Greenhouse’s paradoxes—photosynthetic gossip as surveillance, kiln as dragon—create eerie, self-contained logic. Sensory details (chlorophyll mist, obsidian scars) immerse reader. "Dizzyingly grounded" professor and fractured mirrors enhance disorientation; atmosphere mirrors character’s fractured psyche. All elements cohere to underscore theme of identity-as-process.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Emotional impact emerges through subtext: masks as collective trauma artifacts, plants mirroring human regret. Irony of belonging-as-motion critiques romantic notions of "finding home." Symbolism (kiln destroying/creating identity) elevates beyond surface plot. Ending’s oxygen burst and departure imply cyclical hope without sentimentality. Dialogue minimal but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in combining ceramic science with sentience metaphors avoids genre clichés. Avoids "chosen one" tropes—Galen’s actions are modest yet transformative. Language balances poetic precision ("porcelain visages") with clarity; no empty ornamentation. Metaphors (puzzle piece identities) feel fresh but grounded in context. Nuance over explicit emotion ("oxygen burst" as applause).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize: mask reconstruction deepens both character and plant communication premise. Brevity amplifies existential tension—every action implies larger backstory. Leaves lingering questions about collective narrative (are other deserters "reconstructing"?). Balances specificity (carbon tracking) with philosophical scope. No superfluous detail; cohesive artistic vision.</comment>
