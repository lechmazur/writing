<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity is vividly described but motivations lack psychological depth; the link between child stardom and pursuit of madness is implied but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight structure with strong cause/effect, but some transitions (e.g., from scream to fissure) feel more poetic than logically earned within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory overload creates immersive atmosphere; vibration chamber hums, metallic tang of coins, and melting static create cohesive physicality within surreal parameters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ('radioactive rosary', 'neon worms') masterfully layer meaning; subtext of artistic ruin/redemption resonates beyond fantastical surface narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept execution, though occasional overuse of dense metaphor ('jungle vine around cortex') skirts purple prose without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>All assigned elements function organically, but the story exceeds their scaffolding; brevity enhances rather than limits thematic resonance and lingering questions about cost/creation.</comment>
