<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The deflated oracle’s melancholy and the protagonist’s "independently dependent" nature are poetically rendered but lack emotional depth; motivations are conceptually tied to their roles but lack human nuance, relying on abstract symbolism over tangible emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot’s dreamlike logic creates cohesion but strains causality; the rope-braiding ritual drives the narrative effectively, yet the compact structure leaves some causal links tenuous (e.g., refugees/child outcomes feel abrupt), compromising the sense of arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, specific sensory details (dust-smelled sighs, calendar confetti, phantom rings) create a haunting, immersive dreamscape. The subconscious carnival’s decay and the scent-of-decisions motif amplify the melancholic-gleeful tone, making atmosphere a narrative pillar.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (rope-as-causality, perfume-as-collateral) resonate deeply, and the ending’s blank calendar evokes profound thematic closure. Emotional impact is muted by surreal abstraction but elevated by lyrical craft and layered subtext on choice and sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the carnival’s logic and symbolic objects, avoiding clichés. Some phrasing ("rewound heart") flirts with purple prose, but tonal consistency and inventive metaphors (independent dependency, rope braids) transcend formulaicity, offering narrative surprises.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly intertwined: the setting fuels the atmosphere, the rope method embodies the plot’s stakes, and the tone mirrors the theme. Brevity amplifies the surreal impact, leaving a lingering meditation on rewriting fate.</comment>
