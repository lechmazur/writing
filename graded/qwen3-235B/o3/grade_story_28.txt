<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (archiving folklore, honoring grandmother) is clear but her "sly agent" identity remains underexplored, lacking tension between espionage and personal mission. Emotional depth exists but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is purposeful but strained by word limit—puzzle assembly/confrontation feels rushed. Connection between beginning and end is thematic but lacks narrative payoff. Concept guides plot effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (decaying paint, carnival stripes) create haunting atmosphere. Setting meaningfully connected to object (fork) and concept (fading folklore). Tone occasionally overshadows mood coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evokes nostalgia and urgency through symbolism (fork as living history). Ending feels satisfying but slightly abrupt. Themes of cultural preservation vs. bureaucratic erasure resonate. Overly ornate phrases occasionally distract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh premise avoids common tropes (folklore archivist vs. typical "spy" narratives). Some clichés in descriptions ("mocking finality," "desperate optimism"). Emotional resonance shows nuance but isn't fully earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but feel constrained by length—shortchanged character depth and resolution. Style balances lyricism with clarity. Lingering idea of folklore as living practice elevates the story.</comment>
