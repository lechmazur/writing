<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorn's motivation to confront his past through coins/ghosts is clear, but his internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral. The "disgruntled" trait drives action but lacks grounding in concrete human behavior beyond metaphorical resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc, but transitions between corridor, lectern, and bridge feel compressed rather than organic. The ending resolves the redemption theme but sacrifices structural cohesion for lyrical brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details like phosphorescent arrows and whirling constellations create tactile immersion. The carnival-fantasy hybrid tone is compelling, though the "spy escape route" element feels incongruous with the mystical resolution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (coins as scars, bridge toll) elevate the story. The ending's emotional catharsis lands imperfectly due to the protagonist's passivity, but the central symbolism lingers. Subtext about complicity in others' hopes resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally veers into self-conscious lyricism ("tiny planets of pain"). Character psychology remains ethereal rather than visceral, and the "secret agent" nod feels more contrived than inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story achieves a haunting tone and thematic unity despite its brevity. However, some elements (e.g., spy legacy) undermine cohesion. The constrained form works thematically but strains narrative clarity.</comment>
