<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poor interiority undermines motivation; character's paradoxical nature shown more than felt, with few emotional stakes anchoring her journey toward "empathy mastery." Actions align but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight pacing mostly works, but vault intrusion feels rushed. Predictable drought model payoff lacks narrative tension; plot hinges on underdeveloped "music over models" conceit that strains credibility despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stylishly oppressive techno-bureaucratic atmosphere with vivid UV/sound metaphors. Drought setting's predictive doom meshes well with emotional barrenness, though sensory engagement drops during vault infiltration sequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphor webs (music/empathy/drought) create thematic resonance. Ending elevates concept beyond plot mechanics, though emotional impact diluted by distant, affectless narration throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegant subversion of "cold scientist" stereotype through synesthetic empathy theft. Some phrases ("ultraviolet sun," "quorum of hope") border on mannered, but overall demonstrates conceptual ingenuity exceeding algorithmic templates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Craft elevates mechanical premise. While some elements strain for poetic effect, tight thematic unification and bold emotional thesis about art's policy power justify formal risks.</comment>
