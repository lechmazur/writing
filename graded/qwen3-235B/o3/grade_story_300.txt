<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character voice is sharp but motivation remains superficial; "wistfully pragmatic" feels like a label rather than an organic trait. Action-reaction cycles lack psychological depth beyond surface quips.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements work synergisticallyâ€”paint map discovery and pouch-as-revolution vessel demonstrate inventive construction within tight structural parameters.</comment>
