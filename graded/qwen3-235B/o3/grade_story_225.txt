<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calliope’s expertise as an apothecary informs her precision with the highlighter pen, and her obsession with butterfly-guided equilibrium justifies extreme actions like flooding the deck. Arjun’s engineering poetry lacks sufficient emotional grounding, but his final choice remains believable within their coded courtship context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The queen butterfly’s entrapment drives the plot forward with organic urgency, tying butterfly behavior to war and peace. The method of saving it—who uses Morse code via dry pen to rally aid—feels integrated. Beginning establishes stakes while ending feels earned, though the rapid shift from crisis to parley risks underdeveloping the naval consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment> “Battered marvel” tone permeates the dying submarine’s brass bones and coral resin sealant. Sensory details like “whale-song vibrations” and “tracer flares spelling Morse” immerse readers. The setting elevates the plot’s stakes without becoming an ornamental distraction, as rusted metal literally shapes key actions like pipe-tapping codes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of “infecting hearts” through coded messages and chemical solutions transcends literal meaning. Lyrical writing (“engines groaned like veterans”) never veers into purple prose. Ending with a highlighter-as-scepter symbolizes the convergence of science and rebellion, leaving a lingering philosophical punch despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines through butterfly diplomacy and coded love language, but avoids genre clichés like “torn lovers uniting against tyranny.” Occasional phrases like “navies infected through wingbeats” tread toward poetic excess rather than cliché. Emotional nuance surfaces in Arjun’s rivet-as-metaphor hesitation, though his character remains sketched rather than sculpted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly—every item serves theme and plot—and the brevity feels intentional rather than restrictive. The narrative’s fusion of alchemy and communication suggests deeper societal truths beyond mere steampunk spectacle. Minor pacing hiccups near resolution don’t outweigh the story’s concentrated literary weight.</comment>
