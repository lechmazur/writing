<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strengths in showing Ghalib's internal struggle through symbolic actions and interaction with the thread, though third-person limits distinct voice. Motivation tied cohesively to his hardened nature and eventual emotional awakening.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through cumulative symbolic actions, though pacing feels slightly rushed. Clear beginning-to-end symmetry via the spool's transformation; minor inconsistencies in how abstract elements resolve.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative desert imagery and sensory details (e.g., "moon burned tangerine") create immersive atmosphere. Tone of renewal and introspection aligns with spring cleaning and Ghalib's arc, though some descriptors border on overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (thread as memory/mending, cradle of constellations) and resonant subtext about healing. Ending is emotionally satisfying; theme of redemption through confronting the past is effectively woven through action and symbol.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original use of surreal elements (starlit child, celestial stitching), but some phrasing ("analytically unpredictable") feels forced. Avoids genre clichés but occasionally verges on ornate prose. Emotional nuance shown through imagery rather than explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most assigned elements; brief length enhances poetic focus. Story’s thematic depth and lingering resonance suggest deliberate craftsmanship, though minor tonal and structural inconsistencies prevent perfection.</comment>
