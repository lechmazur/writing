<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation and crisis are conceptually tied to labyrinth obsession but lack personal history/experiential depth; actions align with desperation but emotional resonance remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pseudo-three-act structure (crisis-decision-resolution) works within constraints; pacing efficient but some leaps (e.g., gear clicks) lack tangible causality. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in tactile industrial decay (brass elevator, ventilation grate) but sacred geometric spirituality feels overexplained rather than viscerally felt. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("labyrinthine breath") and recursive stars create transcendent themes, but philosophical revelations occasionally overshadow character's visceral journey. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vintage tech fusion with geometric mysticism refreshes genre tropes; avoids clich√© but some purple prose ("grief hums when loss unnamed") risks sentimentality. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion achieved through labyrinth motif, but thematic weight occasionally strains plausibility; ends with lingering intellectual rather than emotional resonance. </comment>
