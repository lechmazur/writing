<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (making peace with the past) is clear, consistent with actions, and connects to the assigned attribute (carefully reckless). The mercenary's trembling and calculated calm are effectively tied to his trauma. However, some depth is lost in interiority, relying slightly on atmospheric cues over sustained emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive, with the mercenary's goal driving the narrative forward. The action (trade for amber) is logically tied to the method (rumor chains) and resolution. Pacing is tight but manages a full arc within constraints. The connection between beginning/end feels slightly compressed in the transformation of the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The collapsed cathedral’s vivid sensory details (torchlight, graffiti, soot) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. The setting’s duality—religious decay repurposed as art—deeply enriches the tone and theme. Timeframe (“echoing hour”) enhances mood but has minimal impact on plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Epic emotional resonance through metaphor (spider=redemption, amber=past) and subtext (forgiveness as fragile possibility). Ending is poetic yet earned, avoiding sentimentality. Literary devices (grafted bullet holes/halos) are fresh, and the theme of trauma-to-redemption is conveyed subtly across narrative layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; metaphors (e.g., “gunpowder taste”) are novel but verge on archness. Some descriptors (“honeyed stone”) risk ornateness, and the “drone” element occasionally feels underexplored. Emotional progression is shown through symbolic action rather than explicit narration, though the “woman perched on altar” borders on archetypal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated, with the setting, object, and concept serving narrative and theme. The brevity amplifies tension and symbolic focus. The story lingers as a meditation on violence and redemption, though some atmospheric flourishes slightly overspill their functional role.</comment>
