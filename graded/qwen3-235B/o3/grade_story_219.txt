<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s fading glory and introspective quest are symbolically rendered but lack psychological depth; motivations feel archetypal rather than personal, though the corn husk symbolism partially grounds his emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a mystical-quest structure with satisfying circularity (broken clock opening/closing), but pacing unevenly merges metaphysical encounters while compressing 500 words; origami swan’s revelation feels abrupt despite lyrical build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is gorgeously realized through tactile imagery (salt-crusted scars, corn husk’s rasp) and tone—mysterious, elegiac—aligns perfectly with the champion’s internal state and mythic journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich with metaphor (neuronal rivers, cartography of being) and resonant themes of memory/futility; ending transcends narrative to evoke quiet spiritual transformation, though emotional impact is muted by abstract prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality resides in syncretic symbolism (origami neurology) and surreal imagery; occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction (“comforting disturbance”) that feels self-consciously literary rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coheres as a parable of existential reckoning, though reliance on poetic abstraction over concrete stakes limits broader resonance; formal elements enhance beauty but sometimes obscure narrative urgency.</comment>
