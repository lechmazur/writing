<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters function symbolically but lack psychological depth; motivations align with traits but interactions feel orchestrated rather than organic, particularly the abrupt shift from swindler to collaborator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compact structure achieves circularity through physical phenomena driving narrative; some contrived causality (book falling) disrupts realism, but the tight word limit’s constraints are skillfully navigated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering (circuitry-scented apples, wool-and-shear voice textures) creates a hauntingly coherent atmosphere that amplifies both surrealism and thematic tensions between erasure and visibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate as philosophical propositions (commerce vs. listening); the ending’s quiet revolutionary undertones feel earned. Dialogue’s sparseness and subtext elevate the ideological stakes within poetic brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but risks abstract detachment; metaphors like “apple-shaped silence” feel fresh, though occasional phrases (“rotating dust motes”) flirt with excess ornamentation that slightly dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Element integration transcends gimmickry—each device (price tag, magnetized metal) serves multiple narrative functions. The story’s brevity feels purposeful, compressing complex themes into a resonant parable form.</comment>
