<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characters are vividly sketched but emotionally reserved; motivations are implied through symbolic actions (key, ledger) rather than explicit exploration. Kira’s "irritating" questions occasionally feel archetypal rather than deeply organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a quiet, cyclical arc with understated tension. The key’s purpose drives momentum, though resolution feels slightly abrupt. Connection to the city’s indifference is thematically potent but underdeveloped schematically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop garden’s cyberpunk-meets-organic contrast is visceral—neon rain, glitches, synthetic birds. Sensory details (polyglass rhythms, bioluminescent fruit) immerse fully. Atmosphere mirrors thematic dissonance between tech and humanity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the narrative; metaphors (sapling splitting concrete, "encrypted rhythms") resonate. The ending lingers with quiet hope. Subtext about systemic neglect vs. grassroots resilience is woven seamlessly through action, not didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through specific, unconventional imagery (e.g., "scrapyard laughter overriding firewalls"). Emotional restraint feels purposeful rather than generic. Some phrases ("ferocity of a download") flirt with overabstraction but salvage through context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements coalesce thematically without feeling contrived. The story’s brevity sharpens its focus on small acts of resistance. Lingering reflection on legacy, memory, and interdependence elevates beyond plot.</comment>
