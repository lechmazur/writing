<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivations for preserving outlawed knowledge are clear, but emotional depth feels constrained by stylized prose. His systematic rebelliousness is shown through ritualistic habits but lacks visceral human struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compact arc maintains momentum but stumbles on abrupt drone threat introduction. The celestial resolution feels earned yet relies on convenience (improvised beacon). Pacing balances economy and clarity, though transitions rely slightly on trope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Carnival decay merges elegantly with cosmic motifs. Sensory details (e.g., 'popcorn ghosts') crystallize memory and loss. Atmosphere surpasses functional worldbuilding to become thematic partner to the conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., scarf vibrations, 'celestial schedule') elevates into metaphor for control vs. chaos. Ending's equilibrium feels thematically resonant, though emotional payoff is somewhat abstracted. Conflict remains subtle but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>No formulaic beats; subverts smuggling tropes through cerebral characterization. Avoids 'purple prose' despite ornate descriptions through deliberate, concept-driven syntax. The constellated masks and drone distraction reveal ingenuity over algorithmic repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative synergy despite high-concept density. Style prioritizes precision over indulgence, though some atmospheric details could be bolder. Leaves lingering questions about mentor's teachings vs current choices.</comment>
