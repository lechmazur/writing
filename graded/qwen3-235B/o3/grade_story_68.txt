<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While motivations are clear and actions logically follow, the character remains surface-level archetypal - the "moral hacker" trope lacks nuanced contradictions or inner conflicts beyond binary self-contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concise three-act structure within constraints works, but pacing occasionally feels compressed, particularly the abrupt transition from infiltration to system alarms escalation. The mission's stakes could be more viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Electrified antiquity atmosphere is masterfully rendered through specific sensory contrasts - marble pixel fruit versus haptic gloves, code-lattices beside ancient glyphs - though occasional overdescription threatens to clutter rather than enhance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness ("rescued bones," "packet dust") elevates narrative beyond genre exercise. The thematic throughline about historical erasure is potent, though slightly undercut by the ending's overt explication of subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing through inventive combinations (teahouse cybernetics, bureaucratic glitch-centurions). Language remains purposeful without excessive ornamentation, though occasional phrases like "confidence uncertainty" feel more clever than profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Elements interweave cohesively into thematic organism rather than mere checklist. The tight word budget feels artistically necessary, leaving lingering questions about memory, power and digital resurrection that transcend the immediate narrative.</comment>
