<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations beneath poetic abstractions; actions driven more by metaphor than relatable human psychology. Voice feels stylized but not distinctly personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc but relies heavily on metaphorical leaps; cause/effect between stealing the pen and resolution feels ambiguous despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting fused with poetic imagery (fluorescent angels, humming drones) creates immersive, emotionally resonant atmosphere that deeply shapes the story's tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (musical/parcel metaphors) elevate emotional resonance; thematic exploration of regret/progress is clear, though abstractness occasionally undermines character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of retro-futurism and emotional surrealism avoids clich√©s; language is stylized but purposeful, avoiding formulaic phrasing while maintaining a distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Seamless integration of assigned elements; brevity serves poetic impact. Lingering emotional resonance, though some thematic threads feel elusive rather than deliberate.</comment>
