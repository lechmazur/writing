<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical creed provides thematic depth, and the first-person voice maintains consistency, but interiority feels thin for such complex moral stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect chain with the mitten's revelation driving the plot. Some gaps in logistical coherence (tunnel access, artifact logistics) disrupt momentum slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (burnt brake pads, birch-sap syrup) and tonal contrasts between cold urban night and warm ancestral spaces create immersive, emotionally resonant atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mitten as key, frost cracking) and symbolic objects carry thematic weight. Subtext about art as medicine is compelling but slightly underexplored in conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original fusion of medieval/fantasy and bureaucratic dystopia elements avoids clich√©s. Some ornate phrasing strains plausibility (e.g., "smoldering constellations").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story transcends element checklist through thematic synthesis. Brevity serves poetic resonance but leaves some narrative questions (agent center's consequences) tantalizingly unaddressed.</comment>
