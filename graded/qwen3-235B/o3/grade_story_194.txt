<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Branko's lumberjack background and current role clash intriguingly but lack psychological depth; his transformation feels sudden rather than evolved through shown experiences. Voice blends poetic grit with culinary melancholy effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear time (bike rides as narrative spine) creates momentum but sacrifices clarity; connection between nightmares and sanctuary-building feels intuitive rather than structurally inevitable within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone chandeliers as smoke columns, marrow wine's taste of ash, and cedar's medicinal aura fuse setting with theme; the ossuary's transformation into sanctuary achieves haunting sensory cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "tenderness hammered through harsh oak") crystallize theme; ending's duality of fragility/strength resonates; some overwritten passages dilute emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through bizarre yet purposeful juxtapositions (skeleton sommelier, apothecary recipes at dinner parties); occasional lush phrasing ("gunpowder snow") borders on excess but mostly serves mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock with thematic precision; brevity enhances urgency but slightly undermines emotional payoff; layered meditation on healing vs. destruction lingers post-reading.</comment>
