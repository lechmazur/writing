<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters evoke mood but lack psychological depth; motivations hinge on vague existential yearning rather than concrete histories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Enigmatic progression undercut by underdeveloped arc; compass' power feels unearned, finale's symbolic weight isn't fully earned through narrative causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vividly realized through synesthetic details—bio-lumens, ozone-tinged kelp, phosphorescent decay—create immersive, melancholic cyber-noir ambiance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elemental cohesion impressive despite density, though some imposed conceits (polaroids) feel arbitrarily connected; compression sacrifices narrative clarity for poetry.</comment>
