<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clever fusion of "mild-tempered" exterior with subversive inner chaos, but lacks depth in showing psychological transformation. Motivation to reject binaries drives the plot, but character remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic trajectory with visceral imagery, but surreal progression strains coherence. Bicycle chases and anvil-smashing lack narrative anchoring, creating floating dream logic rather than purposeful momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting transcends gimmick through tactile cosmic horror - "glass promenades" and "relativistic twilight" concretize abstract concepts. Atmosphere of quantum-scale decadence haunts every sentence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts heroic tropes with philosophical weight, but emotional resonance diluted by dense metaphor. The centrifugal hammer strike as anti-climax feels conceptually bold yet emotionally unearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Linguistic acrobatics dazzle but occasionally collapse into self-admiration ("dragon's ribcage laughter"). Avoids genre clich√©s through cosmic absurdism while maintaining thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>World-building cohesion falters briefly at anvil encounter, but audacious thematics compensate. Elements serve poetic vision more than narrative architecture, creating memorable conceptual scars.</comment>
