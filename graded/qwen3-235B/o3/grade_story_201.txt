<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mylo's whimsy and impulsiveness shape actions effectively but lack deeper psychological nuance; motivation to right historical wrong is clear but insufficiently questioned or challenged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from arrival to resolution, but the meteor fragment's sudden appearance strains causal logic; pacing balances lyricism with forward momentum within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile atmosphere merges setting and theme through elemental contrasts (waterfall/mist vs. falling stars), though ruins' history could be more viscerally integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant metaphor (melody as legacy) and precise imagery elevate impact; some telling ("restless harmony finally resolved") betrays subtextual potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original mythic structure and organic connections between elements resist clich√©, but occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., "sky's bruised belly") borders on mannered; emotional arcs feel earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically and structurally while transcending formula; condensed form maximizes poetic density without sacrificing narrative closure or thematic resonance.</comment>
