<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits (blameless, logically emotional) are conceptually distinct but lack psychological depth; motivations are logically consistent but underexplored in emotional stakes beyond intellectualized justifications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight 500-word structure shows strong cause-effect but sacrifices emotional weight; pacing efficiently builds tension through countdown, though the engineer's abrupt appearance feels undercontextualized, creating a minor narrative dip.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful sensory world-buildingâ€”scent motifs, tactile descriptions of decaying architecture, and acoustics of the gallery create a palpable, haunting atmosphere that becomes a character in itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Imagistic prose ("silver fish echoes," "inked shadows") and recursive symbolism (scent as compass, art as survival) achieve poetic resonance; ending's thematic closure about invisible artistry feels philosophically profound within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in olfactory navigation and moral paradoxes of smuggling; occasional overreliance on adjective-heavy phrasing ("brassy booms," "royal artery") occasionally distracts from otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion despite complex elements; each assigned component serves multiple narrative functions (e.g., skeleton key as tool, symbol, and moral metaphor) while maintaining elegant brevity.</comment>
