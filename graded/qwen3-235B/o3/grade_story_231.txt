<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's spontaneity drives plot but motivation (justice) feels broadly sketched rather than deeply contextualized; emotional reactions occasionally lack psychological nuance despite vivid voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic throughline (anchor/bookends) but tribunal sequence feels rushed; plot relies heavily on contrived discovery (matching cuneiform) rather than organic character decisions within constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (smoke constellations, goat-carved pillars) create immersive, mythic atmosphere that perfectly complements thematic tension between order and chaos.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery (justice charging interest, "rough blessing of upheaval") creates powerful subtext; ending lacks emotional payoff despite strong thematic resonance; uneven showing/telling balance in character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through Sumerian specificity but contains occasionally overwrought metaphors ("waiting throat") and slightly mechanical transitions between set pieces; tone remains consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but with varying depth; prose quality elevates straightforward justice parable into contemplative narrative; abrupt shifts in power dynamics feel slightly schematic despite polished execution.</comment>
