<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters function as symbols rather than fully realized individuals; motivation exists but lacks psychological depth or evolution, with transformation feeling abrupt and dialogue sparse/unnuanced</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc but feels compressed; pivotal moments (astrolabe's shift, cosmic alignment) lack gradual buildup, and thematic resolution overshadows narrative coherence</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (salt, smoke, howling wind) immerse readers in a vivid, mystical environment that enhances the story's cosmic themes</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (postcards as "whispered star maps") create strong imagery but occasionally overreach; emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract descriptions</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with cosmic mysticism but occasionally slips into ornate prose; dialogue minimal yet effective, though some metaphors (e.g., "interstellar corridors") border on clich√©</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but unevenly weighted; the mythopoetic tone supports cohesion but some plot devices (e.g., astrolabe's heartbeat mirroring) feel underexplored</comment>
