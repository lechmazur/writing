<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and consistent, but psychological depth remains surface-level despite poetic descriptions. Motivations tied to curiosity are clear but lack complex human contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot adheres to mythic arc within word constraints, using symbolic objects to drive progression. Some episodic sections could benefit from tighter integration, but beginning/end resonance is powerful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion elevates worldbuilding beyond convention. Salt-warped spoke, luminescent ink, kelp-curtained exits create layered, memorable atmosphere that deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors function as structural elements, not decoration. Ending's thematic punch - realizing preservation > possession - delivers profound emotional resonance through precise imagery rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While some phrases risk preciousness ("rainless clouds"), original conceits (drowned library as living diary, umbrella spoke as punctuation) demonstrate imaginative command. Avoids AI-creep through specific, non-repetitive imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All assigned elements present, but cohesion wavers - dog park serendipity feels mechanically inserted. Conceptual framework remains strong despite uneven naturalism in certain connections.</comment>
