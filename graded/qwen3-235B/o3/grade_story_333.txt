<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (preservation) but rebellion lacks nuance. Actions align with goals but 'sincere rebel' trait isn't fully fleshed beyond idealism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure connects beginning/end via ledger retrieval. Pacing maintains momentum despite word constraints, though mentor's disappearance feels unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere excels through shifting colors, mildew scent, and auditory tension. Sensory details create immersive decay that mirrors thematic impermanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors ("mortar breathes") and symbolic ledger-as-confession elevate narrative. Theme of preservation vs. erasure resonates; ending shows tradition enduring through dialogue with past.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique fear-as-blueprint concept. Language balances poetic precision with clarity; emotional stakes shown through tactile details, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist seamlessly (passage's mutability strengthens fear theme). Short form amplifies tension; ending leaves thematic resonance about memory's physicality.</comment>
