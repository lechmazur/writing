<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially obscured by dense prose; Marrow’s shift from raider to protector feels underdeveloped but his conflicted loyalty to Lyre adds complexity. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is efficient but strained by the word limit; transitions between action beats (e.g., entering the lab to setting traps) feel abrupt. The connection between Lyre’s past betrayal and present stakes lacks full resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details grounding the underwater decay. However, the social upheaval above remains underexplored, weakening its thematic tie to the lab’s isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery elevates the narrative (e.g., "anemone of soft light"), but emotional resonance is undercut by overreliance on overwritten metaphors. The ending resolves core tension but lacks thematic punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally indulges in ornate description for its own sake. The charcoal method and underwater lab show ingenuity, though some character logic (e.g., Lyre’s sudden trust) feels undercooked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesion is uneven; some elements (charcoal, fractured grace) integrate seamlessly, while others (social upheaval, impulsively thoughtful trait) feel peripheral. The brevity works conceptually but sacrifices nuanced character development.</comment>
