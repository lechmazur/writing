<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's apathy vs. hidden defiance is clear, but his internal conflict could be more actively demonstrated through concrete actions rather than introspective musings. Motivation aligns logically but lacks sufficient emotional weight in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coincidental meteor timing drives resolution but feels slightly contrived. Pacing manages arc adequately but leaves some transitions (e.g., Venn interaction) underdeveloped. Coherence maintained within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details ("burnt tea," "meteor song") and metaphysical setting create immersive atmosphere. Floating monastery's symbolic connection to character psychology is particularly effective through Ojen's anchor metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral imagery ("silver nails scratched the heavens") and thematic duality of promise vs. resignation resonate strongly. Ending sacrifices plot clarity for poetic resolution but maintains emotional coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through metaphysical elements but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing ("velvet over ragged heap of clouds"). Character psychology shows human nuance despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work in harmony - promise motif anchors narrative, meteor theme unifies structure. Style consciously uses brevity as strength, ending on contemplative note that lingers beyond immediate plot.</comment>
