<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Promises of 'power' and 'unraveling' shape Marin's choices but lack emotional depth; his welding background hinted via mirrors but insufficiently woven into his present motivations or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crossing timelines provides clear structure, but the shift from club bouncer to cosmic fusion feels abrupt; pacing works within constraints but resolution leans on vague metaphor over earned dramatic logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (brine, peeling mirrors) create mood, yet the broken planetarium’s transformation into a 'living sea' lacks grounded logic; atmosphere occasionally prioritizes style over functional worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marksman use of metaphor ('threads sealed underwater, undone joyously') elevates the fantastical; ending evokes awe but risks vagueness—subtext about merging identities resonates, though emotional stakes remain ethereal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of steampunk mysticism and existential sci-fi avoids tropes; avoids AI-isms through specific imagery (e.g., 'asteroid cocktails'), though 'welding auroras' might verge on ornate; tonal consistency trumps occasional abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Elements like buttons and timelines integrate tightly, but Marin’s character arc remains secondary to spectacle; the ending’s cosmic inheritance feels more like a concept showcase than a human story with cosmic implications.</grade>
