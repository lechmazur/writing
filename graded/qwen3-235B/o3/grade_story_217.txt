<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (stagnant heart) is clear and ties to action, but "underestimated rebel" trait remains superficially stated rather than sufficiently demonstrated through distinct behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunting-to-healing arc achieves cohesion, though pacing falters slightly in rapid transition from mannequin encounter to emotional resolution. Phone call's dual role as plot driver and symbolic object is ingenious.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (soy/garlic aroma, vibrating phone) merge carnal and spectral realms seamlessly. Setting's ephemeral gloom provides ideal tonal contradiction to eventual warmth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Dumpling diplomacy as metaphor for human connection achieves poetic resonance. Final line's "dough rising" image crystallizes the theme of adaptability with devastating economy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into mythic miniature, with pocket knife and dumpling both serving practical and symbolic functions. Story's brevity feels intentional, echoing carnival's impermanence.</comment>
