<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's bafflement and curiosity drive actions, but motivation to "challenge the status quo" lacks gradual evolution; voice is distinct in poetic duels but emotional nuance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from discovery to transcendence through poetry, but pacing feels compressedâ€”ending achieves resolution yet lacks depth in showing transformation's consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (brine, rust, spectral steam) create immersive maritime decay; haunted lighthouse and dummy's uncanny presence unify eerie tone with thematic metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (engines of identity, poetry as liberation) enrich layered themes; dialogue with dummy feels purposeful, ending resonates with symbolic rebirth of perception and societal critique.</comment>
