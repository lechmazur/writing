<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Yorisho's arrogance and hidden doubt are vividly shown through physical gestures and dialogue, but motivations occasionally verge on abstraction. The tapestry fragment's role in his transformation is well-connected. Character voice leans stylized but retains authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of challenge, transformation, and resolution within tight constraints. Authorization drives the central action; the transition from confrontation to song is logically handled through metaphor. Pacing balances poetic description with narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting merges with themeâ€”the calligraphy courtyard's engraved history and the tapestry fragment's woven potential create layered symbolism. Sensory details (ink, light, breath) evoke a contemplative atmosphere that mirrors character growth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose uses metaphor (tapestry as self, song as ancestral memory) to deepen emotional resonance. Ending achieves thematic closure through image (red sword) rather than exposition. Avoids over-explanation, trusting reader interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combines familiar elements (swordsman's arc, mystical master) with originality in metaphoric execution. Avoids purple prose through precise details (e.g., "threads dancing"). Some phrases like "storm-born snowflakes" border on ornate but serve atmospheric purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified exploration of identity and legacy. Concise form feels intentional, with each image contributing to the theme. Lingering impact comes from resonant final image: a swordsman walking into darkness transformed by self-awareness.</comment>
