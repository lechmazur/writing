<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters feel archetypal; motivations implied but lightly sketched. The 'pleasantly troublesome' trait works best for Mael. Ruo's 'loyal wanderer' identity lacks emotional depth. Limited nuance in reactions/reasons driving actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from dance class to barricade to stewardship pact. Pacing rushed in places, cohesive despite constraints. The tremor/barricade action drives momentum; solstice reunion feels underdeveloped. Arc completes but lacks weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent lake and scrimshaw create vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (neon vortices, trembling marble) enhance mood. Some dissonance between 'dance class' and 'collapsed limestone' shifts tone abruptly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength lies in metaphor-rich prose and theme of art as dialogue. Ending's plankton dance lingers. Conflict (tremors/barricade) resolved too easily. Subtext about preservation vs. impermanence hinted but underexplored. Dialogue sparse yet poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original worldbuilding with nautical-hermit tropes and art-as-activism theme. Avoids clich√©s but some phrases ('quiet revolutions,' 'chorused heartbeats') verge on sentimental. Story feels human-crafted but occasionally leans on lush description over momentum.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack interdependence. The lake, scrimshaw, and barricade anchor the narrative; dance class and solstice pact feel tacked on. Brevity allows focus but sacrifices emotional stakes. Leaves a visual and thematic imprint, lacks urgency.</comment>
