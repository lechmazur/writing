<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's skepticism is present but underdeveloped; motivations drive the plot but emotional stakes remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Circular structure works, but some transitions between thimble activations feel rushed; cause/effect coherence slightly strained by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details create vivid analog/digital contrasts, but the futuristic setting’s rules are inconsistently fleshed out (e.g., digitized minds’ role).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., thunder as memory) and layered subtext about preservation elevate the narrative; ending resonates emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and deliberate style avoid formulaicity; avoids overt tech-bro clichés but occasionally veers into self-indulgent abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>All elements coalesce into a thematically cohesive whole; brevity feels intentional, though some plot mechanics (e.g., thimble mechanics) lack explicit explanation.</comment>
