<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s stoicism lacks evolution; motivation is clear but underexplored—how does archiving tie to his identity? Actions align with traits, but inner conflict or nuance is minimal beyond surface-level “brash tenderness.”</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively from journey to archive ritual, with nightmares as a logical guide. Pacing is tight but abrupt shifts (e.g., sudden map formation) strain causality. Resolution feels purposeful but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting sensory details (chalk equations glowing like frost, “gullied moonlight”) immerse readers. The witch’s training ground’s eerie logic enriches the ritual theme, though its full potential isn’t exhausted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (floorboard as palimpsest of secrets) and subtext about myth vs. history resonate. The ending’s ink-on-palms gesture is poetic, but emotional resonance leans on abstraction over visceral character investment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; nightmares-as-map and “splintered keepsake” feel fresh. Overly intricate phrasing (“voices mesmerizingly bland”) occasionally borders on affectation, but the voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements merge conceptually but strain at edges—e.g., the teacher’s abrupt arrival feels plot-convenient. The brevity sharpens mystery but leaves themes like “necessary lies” underexplored. Lingering questions about ritual’s ethics.</comment>
