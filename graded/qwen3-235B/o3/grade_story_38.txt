<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice and symbolic traits (insomnia, botanical samples) but inconsistent motivation beyond surface urgency; character reactions lack layered psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolic arc (subway to attic) but pacing uneven; sudden resolution via drunken confessions feels unearned despite thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich, immersive atmosphere with sensory details (flourescent hum, ozone, dust motes); haunted attic contrasts effectively with subway's transient emptiness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("planetary eye rings," "apologizing ghosts") and subtext about nonviolence; some overwritten passages dilute emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh use of botanical research as narrative device; occasional over-embellishment (e.g., "gentle thunder") borders on pretentiousness but avoids formulaic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Compelling integration of assigned elements into thematic framework; concise form feels intentional, though some narrative leaps strain believability.</comment>
