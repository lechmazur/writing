<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (unspoken trauma, pursuit of cosmic truth) are present but abstract; emotional layers remain surface-level beneath lyrical descriptions; consistency maintained but depth sacrificed to poetic density</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ritualistic arc (seeking path → offering → transcending) within tight constraints; surreal logic occasionally muddies cause-effect but intentional; resolution feels thematically earned rather than contrived</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sense of corroded grandeur (crumbling alley/theater) rendered through tactile details (drizzle, violet shard light) creates immersive uncanny atmosphere; setting merges mythic weight with urban decay</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric layers (masks as burdens, contradiction as wisdom) deepen narrative; language-as-cosmic-force theme resonates through inventive imagery; ending provides reflective closure while preserving mystery</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Richly original metaphors (stars as phonemes, geometry sweating) avoid clichés; some phrasal cadences border on mannered but serve the mythopoeic tone; emotional resonance conveyed through symbolic gestures rather than direct psychology</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All assigned elements function cohesively; experimental elements (contradictory verbs, linguistic cosmology) feel purposeful rather than gimmicky; slight overreliance on archaic diction occasionally distances reader</comment>
