<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Claryon's skepticism and motivation to out-scheme Posthumous are clear and consistent, though his belief shift at the end feels underdeveloped despite his distinct voice and ironic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight with cause-effect clarity; the slingshot gambit drives momentum. Pacing is efficient, but the beginning-to-end connection relies heavily on accepting the vanishing ink's "logic" as plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Factory's soot-clogged skylights, dormant vats, and hissing steam create a layered, decayed industrial atmosphere that reinforces themes of lost creativity. Sensory details (scalding whispers, sparks as refrains) are evocative and integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story uses paradoxical motifs (silent songs, vanishing treasures) to explore artistic theft and generosity. Silence as unstealable "melody" is a powerful metaphor. Subtext about valuing ephemeral vs. owned ideas resonates beyond the plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("scaly refuse can sing") avoid clich√©s. Character logic (bankrupting theft via generosity) blends human ingenuity with myth. No overt purple prose, though some phrases (e.g., "reckless generosity, weaponized") verge on thematic overemphasis.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>All elements interlock: disappearing ink enables the proclamation; factory setting justifies steam vent method. Word limit feels purposeful, with the theme of impermanence tying into brevity. Concludes with lingering resonance about art and ownership.</comment>
