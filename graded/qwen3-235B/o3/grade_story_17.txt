<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character’s guilt drives actions consistently, but limited time restricts deeper exploration of motivations. The confession as guardian/debtor feels earned but rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot’s progression through eulogy analysis is logical yet feels condensed; the missing name as climax works, but resolution’s spiritual transformation lacks full grounding in cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details (burnt thyme, dripping wax), but the witch’s chamber leans on genre tropes rather than redefining them uniquely.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracked bowl, pebble tally) resonate thematically. Ending’s balance between ambiguity and closure is poignant, though some phrasing (“zoomed outward like lungs”) veers toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in using funeral eulogies to trace lineage, avoiding clichés. Occasional phrases (“unjaded sky”) risk abstraction, but the integration of guilt and ritual feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly into a thematically unified whole. The blend of genealogy, witchcraft, and redemption suggests depth beyond plot, though brevity occasionally undermines emotional weight.</comment>
