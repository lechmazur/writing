<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical trait is vivid but lacks depth in how he evolved into this self-destruction/redemption arc; motivations are clear (self-confrontation) but emotionally opaque due to minimal backstory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works within word limit, balancing surreal progression with psychological "fighting" arc; cause-effect logic holds (shard triggers dream journey â†’ confrontation), but mirror corridor transition slightly abrupt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and consistent: sensory-rich descriptions of dust, ticking gears, and glass-shattering evoke a decaying mechanical purgatory. Timeframe reference to sculptor's chisel adds mythic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphor density (shard as both relic and weapon, clockwork wolf as inner drive) elevates thematic clarity. Ending resonates emotionally through physical transformation (carved flesh = conviction); subtext about performative survival permeates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids AI tropes through unique juxtapositions (e.g., "pain rang like bells") and psychological specificity; metaphors are fresh and not over-explained. Tones shifts (e.g., smug twin's dialogue) maintain organic unpredictability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive symbolic ecosystem; limited length paradoxically strengthens the intensity of self-confrontation. Lingering questions about the unnamed "temple" and market stalls hint at deeper worldbuilding without detracting.</comment>
