<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Promising internal struggle and consistent motivation, but character psychology remains opaque despite lyrical descriptions of actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves methodically toward catharsis; some transitions glossed over due to word limit but maintain emotional logic through symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in subterranean brewing atmosphere; dogs enhance rather than distract from mood, with details of steam, bitterness, and metallic gleam.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphor density (e.g., grief fermenting) and thematic cohesion around faith vs. chemistry; emotional impact arises naturally from imagery, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original mythos construction avoids genre tropes; language occasionally risks overadornment but never loses emotional core amid symbolic richness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story feels purposefully compressed rather than constrained; elements like dogs and brewing framework serve both concrete detail and metaphysical inquiry.</comment>
