<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's voice and motivation are distinct but underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in tight word limit; beginning/end connection exists but feels hurried; candle-driven plot logic strained by corridor eight's sudden existence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie, cohesive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (shards, whispers), though labyrinth's connection to broader world remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (candle as loaded die, mirrors stitching) add depth; ending lacks emotional weight despite thematic resolution; "showing" inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh use of cryptid tropes and mirrors; avoids clich√© through candle method and "invitation" theme, but some ornate phrasing distracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but not innovatively; brief length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; lingering imagery but thematic subtlety lacking.</comment>
