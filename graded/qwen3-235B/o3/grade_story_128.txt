<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Promising internal conflict in a fretful archer seeking truth, but motivation feels underexplored beyond surface declarations of "unfiltered eyes." Lacks nuance in how past experiences shaped his hesitant boldness; reactions to narrative turning points feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot is driven by inventive subtitle-guided navigation but risks incoherence through rapid shifts between mythic and modern elements (pharaohs and TV static). Resolution at the photograph feels earned but underdeveloped; cause/effect for turning points require more groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends sand-soft decay with surreal tech intrusion effectively. However, inconsistent sensory detail—torches and cathode-ray screens coexist without tension—dilutes immersion. The fading photo moment is vividly original but conceptually fragmented.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vibrant metaphors ("spice symbolized a story") elevate theme but occasionally overwhelm emotional resonance. Ending's thematic payoff is strong, though character transformation feels rushed. Subtext about myth-making is compelling but under-woven into narrative mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through temporal dissonance (Victorian photos/TV reruns) and metaphoric depth. Some phrasing ("sand in wind") borders on rote lyricism. Emotional beats rely on abstract imagery over human nuance, yet the story's genre-blending imagination earns distinction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like the recipe map and fading photograph create cohesion through metaphor but strain logic when intersecting—a palace with TV signals? The bittersweet conclusion lingers, though the rushed transformation undercuts narrative punch.</comment>
