<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivations lack grounding—Mara's detachment feels stylized but insufficiently earned, weakening her arc toward "small revolt" in the ending.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</comment>Plot coherence falters under abstraction; the sequence of events (pickup repair → choirboy moment) lacks clear causal logic despite lyrical momentum, muddying thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Enthralling atmosphere merges mechanical and organic elements with precise, visceral imagery; the cathedral-orphanage setting is hyper-sensory and irreplaceable as a symbolic collision zone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors and subtext (e.g., twist tie as unknotted trauma, bees as spiritual translators) elevate the narrative through layered symbolism; ending achieves resonant, quiet catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines but occasionally veers into surreal obfuscation; some phrases ("whispers of gasoline and nectar") risk preciousness, though the fusion of liturgy and machinery remains conceptually bold.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion struggles under the weight of its own poetry; disparate elements (mechanics, bees, choirboy trauma) form a tapestry but fail to synthesize into a seamless, unforgettable whole.</comment>
