<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mariel’s caution and archival drive are consistently portrayed, but her internal conflict lacks depth; her actions align with her motivation, though emotional resonance is somewhat told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Logical progression exists, but cause-effect connections (e.g., rosary’s sudden activation) feel underdeveloped; the compact arc works, yet pacing feels compressed in key moments like the archive’s liberation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (serpent-skull fortress, bone chimes) and metaphorical motifs immerse readers; ordered disarray enhances the setting’s thematic tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Purposeful use of symbolism (e.g., serpent-shaped texts) and thematic cohesion elevate impact, though some emotional beats lean on abstraction over visceral showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (windweaving, fossilized insects) avoid clichés, but occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., “brazen sun”) veers toward mannerism, slightly diluting authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements tightly interwoven; the theme of liberating stories resonates thematically, though tighter pacing in pivotal scenes would enhance cohesion.</comment>
