<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paper-thin protagonist; traits remain poetic abstraction rather than psychologically convincing motivation. Actions driven more by thematic necessity (symbolic scientist needing to "cultivate") than human logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent arc compressed into vignette format shows admirable efficiency. Conceptual momentum maintained through recurring motif transitions (flakes→veil→light), though emotional payoff feels artificially expedited.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</comment><comment>Phenomenal environmental cohesion: every detail from "mirror-ice" to "incandescent fruit" serves both metaphysical atmosphere and narrative causality. Polar glass idol dissolution is particularly atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonant symbolism (frozen bride/empathy lens) and paradoxical science-poetry fusion create lasting impact. Subtext about fear's suppression through generative metaphor elevates beyond surface plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Escapes complete formulaicity through inventive combinations (astronomer-botanist algorithm hybridity) but occasionally succumbs to decorative excess ("emotionally hollow" as un-illuminating placeholder phrasing).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic unity and elegant compression justify brevity rather than seeming restricted. Each element contributes to exploring how art/science might reanimate feeling through attentive curation.</comment>
