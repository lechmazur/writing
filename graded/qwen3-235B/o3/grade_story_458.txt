<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's actions align with motivation to preserve tradition, but inner conflict remains underexplored. Voice as "spiritually secular" librarian is conceptually compelling but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from retrieval to crisis to resolution, with cause-effect clarity. The "looping compromise" third option feels slightly contrived but resolves effectively within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong visual details about decaying spaceport create immersive atmosphere. Sensory elements like "fluorescent ghosts" and "creaking suit" enhance mood but deeper integration with thematic elements could be stronger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors ("syllables that survived when walls fell") and symbolic logic impress. Ending resonates thematically but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original combination of futuristic library with tactile rituals (coffee stains, coat button). Avoids expected tropes despite AI-susceptible premise; language balances precision and poetry without purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional whole despite ambitious concept pile. Style demonstrates individuality but occasionally strains under weight of multiple required elements.</comment>
