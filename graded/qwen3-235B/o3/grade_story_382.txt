<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's unruffled nature is consistent but lacks multi-dimensional depth. Motivation is abstract rather than psychologically resonant; the blend of sorrow and hope is poetic but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a coherent arc but struggles with pacing in the middle; transitions between exploration and revelation are fluid but lack narrative tension to sustain urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of contrasting sensory details (crunching petals vs. café murmurs) and symbolic atmosphere. The labyrinthine library's tactile decay and surreal geometry immerse readers in thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Literary devices (Möbius corridors, fire as "signature") are inventive, but emotional impact is uneven; some metaphors feel labored, undercutting their lyrical potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the dream dictionary's paradox and the library's transformation, but veers toward ornate abstraction. Avoids clichés but occasionally sacrifices clarity for style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole; brevity enhances mystery. The fusion of sensory detail, metaphor, and existential themes lingers, though abstract resolutions may polarize readers.</comment>
