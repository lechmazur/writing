<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weak motivation depth; character's 'unknowing heir' identity lacks psychological exploration. Abstract reactions to surreal events feel poetic but underdeveloped for literary credibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fragmented plot coherence; spoon-driven action progresses narrative but dissolves into poetic abstraction. Tightly constrained arc resolves through visual metaphor rather than traditional causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vividly realized magnetic field physics and abandoned theater sensory layering (iron scents, rewound summer sparks) create immersive, electrified atmosphere that overshadows narrative weaknesses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Profound metaphor density (spoons as contracts, static crowns) elevates impact. Subtext about rewriting history through marginalia resonates, though emotional resonance diluted by abstract characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original surrealism avoids genre tropes; magnetic mountain mythology feels fresh. Occasional ornate phrasing ("celluloid royalty") threatens to undermine authentic weirdness with affected whimsy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uneven cohesion; elements (spoon, projector) serve symbolic purpose but struggle within brevity constraints. Lingering conceptual resonance compensates for structural brevity's limitations.</comment>
