<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in tight word limit; sudden transitions between key locations (orchard → cave → farmhouses) lack connective tension; concept shapes plot but resolution feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>HyperLumen's synthetic countryside and decaying farmhouses create vivid, thematically rich atmosphere; sensory details like fermented nightmares and humming dragon tooth amplify mood.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into ambitious whole but feel overstuffed; premise lingers conceptually while execution falters under word constraints; tone retains uniqueness despite pacing issues.</comment>
