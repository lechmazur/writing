<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits (begrudging, 'dangerously friendly' glint) and motivation (rediscovering joy) is tied to postcards/bread paddle. Arc resolves with liberation, but emotional nuance during transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from malfunction to liberation. Cause-effect clarity (postcards as blueprints ➔ flight), but compressed arc leaves little room for tension buildup; resolution feels abrupt within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sanctuary's chrome-aviary-in-spacetime setting is visually iconic. Sensory details (oil, citrus-thunder mist, pulsing carvings) immerse reader and metaphorically support themes of constrained beauty and societal sterility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (bread as lost wonder, birds as revolutionary tools) deepen themes. Ending rejects sentimental closure for bittersweet catharsis. Subtext about societal complacency through 'cheering' citizens works brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi, surrealism, and artisan motifs. Avoids clichés with 'postcards as liberation plans' twist. Some stylistic risks (e.g., 'perfumed folds') border on ornate but generally enhance mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock: postcards drive plot/concept, bread paddle symbolizes joy, sanctuary enables rebellion. Compression amplifies urgency without sacrificing coherence. Ending resonates thematically.</comment>
