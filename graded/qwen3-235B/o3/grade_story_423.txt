<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits present but thinly developed; motivation drives action but lacks psychological depth. Inner conflict remains underexplored despite nostalgic glimpses.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear cause/effect progression with poetic closure, but pacing occasionally strains under 500-word constraints, creating slight narrative compression artifacts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole with lingering resonance, though some components rely on poetic license rather than narrative urgency.</comment>
