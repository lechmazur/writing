<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but Ifras remains more symbolic than deeply developed; lacks emotional depth or personal stakes despite aligning actions with traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Logical progression from conflict to resolution, but tight word count leads to compressed pacing; some transitions between scenes feel abrupt despite overall cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive sensory details (porcelain lighthouse, confetti seasons) create a distinct world where setting and tone intertwine seamlessly with thematic concerns of stasis vs. transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ideal use of metaphor (snow globe as fragile order, plastic lid as forbidden knowledge) and lyrical imagery; resolves central conflict with symbolic weight while maintaining emotional resonance and thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surreal elements with philosophical subtext; avoids clich√©s through inventive details (e.g., confessional tapes, magnetic snow); language is poetic but never self-indulgent, prioritizing thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively into a self-contained parable, though brief length occasionally forces abstraction over clarity; leaves lingering intellectual/emotional impact typical of high-concept speculative fiction.</comment>
