<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth in emotional complexity; the clumsily dexterous trait feels surface-level beyond physical actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but rushed in transitions (e.g., studio to square); the silent retribution climax is coherent but could be more gradual.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (e.g., "prismatic menace") but inconsistently connected to deeper themes; the witch's cauldron room feels underutilized beyond aesthetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("silence as a waveform") and subtext about trauma; ending resonates but emotional weight could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original blend of technical/mystical elements avoids clich√©s; minor overwrought phrases ("jealous echo") but overall fresh voice and pacing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven; concise length enhances focus; ending lingers with thematic ambiguity about justice.</comment>
