<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength in integrating Huxley's backstory (language barriers/fists) with present actions, but motivation to "mold a myth" lacks psychological depth despite symbolic resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Coherent three-act structure within tight constraints; map-plotting and baton retrieval logically connected to climax, though drum motifs strain slightly as framing device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral atmosphere through sensory dissonance (rot-adjacent beauty, musical violence); greenhouse ecosystem meaningfully integrated with myth-building quest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elegant metaphoric layering (drums as ancestral heartbeat, plants as language barriers); ending resonates thematically without didacticism; subtext dominates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>No formulaic phrasing despite heightened language; original metaphors (map-veins, sonic resurrection) avoid genre clich√©s; emotional nuance shown through tactile plant interactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve organic narrative arc; economy enhances (not limits) thematic impact; final rhythm-shift lingers as meditation on creation/destruction duality.</comment>
