<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation (compassion overriding control) is clear but underdeveloped; her archery skills feel tacked onto cyberpunk elements without sufficient psychological integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Candle-driven mission logically connects beginning/end, but quantum decryptor arrow and drone reprogramming feel rushed; cause-effect lacks technical plausibility despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually striking fusion of archaic candle/smeg-choked tenements with liquid-cooled servers creates powerful juxtaposition; "borrowed dawn" light effectively mirrors narrative tension between transience and permanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "water passed through centuries" and mandala projections offer meaningful subtext; lyrical prose successfully "shows" ethical dilemmas without over-explanation, particularly in drone climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in merging archery with hacking conceits, but contains AI-like phrasing patterns ("whispered forbidden packets," "ailing conscience"); emotional beats occasionally veer toward poetic abstraction over nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve theme more than plot coherence; concise format showcases thematic compression akin to speculative poetry rather than traditional narrative arcs.</comment>
