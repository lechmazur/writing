<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Grogginess and brewer identity remain surface-level traits that inform metaphors but don't deeply shape character choices; motivation appears as expositional declaration rather than organic drive; voice occasionally memorable ("half prophet, half bartender") but inconsistent in maintaining alcoholic mystic persona through critical action sequences</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story achieves complete arc with initiation of light-rebirth gesture, but relies on abrupt supernatural transitions that strain internal logic; cause-and-effect connections between mirror use and darkness repulsion lack grounding despite poetic momentum; pacing unevenly balances atmospheric immersion with sudden magical resolution</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting achieves remarkable synergy between protest energy and ghostly decay; atmosphere built through masterful sensory layering (spilled confessions in cellar air, slogans-as-vines texture); temporal contrast between revolutionary immediacy and spectral timelessness deepens thematic resonance rather than competing</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Persistent metaphor economy (fermentation = revolution, beer = clarity) creates intellectual heft; ending delivers satisfying thematic cadence through "brewing something finer than any barrel" revelation; tension between flippant/solemn tones maintains narrative vitality; subtext about collective action as magic exceeds surface plot</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive protest-horror hybridization but occasionally lapses into baroque excess ("celery air seasoned with centuries of spilled confession"); some metaphors feel over-synthesized ("cosmic joke bureaucrat necktie") yet achieve unique emotional registers through persistent brewer perspective</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole where each component serves metaphorical/plot purposes; brevity works as stylistic strength mimicking revolutionary manifestos; atmospheric density suggests depth beyond explicit narrative despite occasional schematic construction of concepts</comment>
