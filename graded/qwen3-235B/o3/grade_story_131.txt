<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is consistent but under-explored; internal conflict hinted at but not deeply excavated. Motivation for adaptation is tied to trauma but lacks nuanced emotional layers beyond stated fear.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through cause-effect (gravitational anomaly → discovery → ascent). Ends with a circular return to "adaptation," though compressed pacing slightly undermines emotional payoff of transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered via gravity-defying objects and sensory details; setting amplifies character's isolation and the surrealism of their awakening. Exceptional synergy between anomaly and mood of existential dislocation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (stones, gravity, "softly audible" motifs) deepen thematic resonance. Ending transcends plot to evoke existential acceptance, though emotional impact is tempered by detached narration style.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in combining cosmic anomaly with intimate trauma; some similes ("bobbing like timid fish") edge toward familiarity. Avoids predictability but could risk more radical subversion of "orphangeon" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements feel interconnected and purposeful. Style enhances the allegorical tone but occasionally veils raw vulnerability; brevity amplifies mystery over emotional immediacy.</comment>
