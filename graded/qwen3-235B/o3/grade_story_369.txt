<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation of "optimistically bitter" heart is consistent but lacks deeper development beyond surface-level reactions to puzzles; the fanatical puzzle maker remains underexplored, functioning more as a plot device than a fully realized presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot driven by ritualistic actions (tying string, burning confession) creates forward momentum, but the transition from lighthouse ritual to "shattering beams" feels abrupt; the ending evokes thematic cohesion but could better integrate the tight word limit into a more impactful resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile descriptions (damp parchment, rusted railings) and tonal contrasts between lethargic decay and spiritual tension; the lighthouse setting meaningfully reflects the protagonist's internal state and the weight of secrets theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potent use of metaphor (e.g., "lighthouse as confessional") and poetic imagery creates emotional resonance; the ending's subtext about being "solved" by outside forces adds philosophical depth. Slight over-reliance on ornate phrasing occasionally distracts from raw emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures through surreal symbolism and psychological insight; metaphors like "charred remorse as Morse code" feel fresh. Some phrases ("writhing heart," "storms claimed to survive") verge on abstraction without concrete grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds through evocative atmosphere and thematic unity despite its brevity, though tighter integration of the puzzle maker's role and clearer stakes for the protagonist's ordeal would elevate coherence and emotional weight.</comment>
