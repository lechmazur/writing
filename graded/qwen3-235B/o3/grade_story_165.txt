<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are mostly clear and consistent, but interiority remains underdeveloped; the protagonist's choices align with stated gentleness but lack psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Well-structured three-act progression within constraints; some transitional moments (like contest's resolution) feel rushed despite generally effective pacing. Clear thematic bookends anchor the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery through precise, contradictory sensory combinations (emberlight vs. fragility; underground vs. surface memories); setting functions as active narrative participant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration mostly organic but occasionally schematic; thematic through-line strengthens collective impact; resonant final image transcends structural limitations.</comment>
