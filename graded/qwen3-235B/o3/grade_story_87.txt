<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; his "hyperactively serene" attribute feels stated rather than embodied through nuanced actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically, but the steampunk setting occasionally distracts from narrative urgency; cause/effect is clear, though pacing feels slightly rushed in key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (steam, gears, clanging forks) and thematic fusion of mechanical precision with emotional repression create an immersive, mood-enhancing world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (sticker sheet as buried past, mixtapes as guilt) and eerie atmosphere, but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with inventive steampunk fusion, though occasional overly ornate phrasing ("throb into vengeance") risks sounding contrived rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively, but the steampunk setting feels occasionally decorative; concise form emphasizes thematic efficiency but slightly undersells emotional complexity.</comment>
