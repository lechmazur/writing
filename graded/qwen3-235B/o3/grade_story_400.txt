<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character development is subtle but present; Aelwyn's ambivalence is well-woven into her actions and internal conflict. Her motivation (overcoming fear through ritual) lacks full emotional depth despite effective symbolic gestures like the safety pin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (silence → action → resolution) with efficient use of constraints. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in the gathering sequence, muddying cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels: sensory details (sour stew fragrance, groaning ice) create immersive atmosphere. Setting deeply influences plot and theme, though post-human context remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact via restrained lyricism. Metaphors (thawfern as "emerald sails") and subtext about solitary healing resonate. Ending succeeds but feels slightly contrived in its tranquility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with fresh imagery (blue ice crevasse, shardfire lamp). Some phrases ("hush they left behind") risk over-refinement. Emotional nuances feel earned, though voice occasionally slips into generality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements harmonize tightly: orchard, pin, and ritual meal drive cohesion. Style elevates substance without pretension. Ending's quiet triumph lingers thematically, though scale remains intimate rather than transcendent.</comment>
