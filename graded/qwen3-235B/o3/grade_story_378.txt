<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's accidental status lacks deeper exploration; outward actions (scowling, muttering) compensate inconsistent emotional depth. Grumpiness feels more gimmick than motive-shaping trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight pacing with dawn-imposed deadline creates momentum; resolution feels slightly abrupt despite effective cause-effect chain. Carnival timeframe integrates plot mechanics but lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Polluted orchard's sensory details create eerie immersion; tonal dissonance between monastic grafting and carnival capitalism weakens cohesion. Water wisdom remains superficially mystical rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Beguiling metaphors ("courageous metronome") and cyclical structure elevate narrative impact. Ending's historical recording beetle adds poignant layer to "accidental" legacy without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formula through eccentric combinations (singing monks vs. financial schemers). Occasional over-ornamentation ("damp laughter") balanced by vivid originality (vinegar-breath halos).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High-concept elements serve narrative purpose without feeling forced; stylistic choices mostly enhance rather than obscure. Time constraint occasionally strains emotional authenticity.</comment>
