<question>1</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Character is a flat archetype defined by labels rather than actions; "morally ambiguous indulgence" feels imposed rather than demonstrated through tangible decisions or consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc of curiosity -> discovery -> transformation, but the intercom scene and instant world-memory-planting strain credibility; pacing stumbles slightly under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (soot/thyme, squeaking shoes) immerse readers, but the smoke tower's historical purpose feels arbitrarily fused with the grocery-store setting rather than logically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors ("obsidian seed reflecting gardener and grave robber") create resonance, but the ending's "asphalt cracked, sprouting..." feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique combinations (xerographed festivals, obsidian seeds), but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("flickering images of lost harvests") that prioritizes texture over emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking originality in conceptual fusion; uses constrained format purposefully, though some elements (indistinct character voice, underdeveloped consequences) prevent reaching "flawless" territory.</comment>
