<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's underachiever status and heritage drive the plot, but motivations shift abruptly from land preservation to personal empowerment. Inner conflict remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently from packages to activation, but the transition from failure to mastery feels rushed. Cause/effect logic (e.g., courier's actions) lacks grounding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The space station's decay and farmland contrast effectively, but the connection between orbital tech and agricultural land remains underdeveloped. Sensory details are vivid but sporadic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (doubt as a trap, limitations as misdelivered packages) enrich the theme. The ending's emotional payoff works, though some 'showing' could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through blending sf/magic elements. Fresh metaphors (scarecrow bones, star-ink signatures) anchor style. No formulaic beats; tone remains consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively, particularly the doll and rune mechanics. The brief form feels intentional, though the farmland stakes could be more viscerally connected to the orbital climax.</comment>
