<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's unique voice (sentient plant) is strongly established, but motivation (hidden knowledge) occasionally veers into abstraction without emotional grounding. Internal conflict (ambivalence) dominates over clear action goals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has lyrical cohesion despite tight word count, with cyclical structure from abandonment to stewardship. Pacing lags slightly in midsection; cause/effect logic occasionally obscured by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting achieves mythic decay through hyper-specific sensory details (moth-beaten shadows, rusted speakers). Timeframe as post-typewriter "final page" elegantly mirrors drive-in's lifelessness. Atmosphere transcends gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Storytelling dazzles through paradoxical synthesis (apathy/devotion, silence/noise). Metaphors function as narrative architecture, not ornamentation. Ending resonates as inevitable yet ambiguous, inviting reader interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality borders on preciousness but avoids it through visceral imagery. Avoids AI-tropes via specific, non-generic details (soda syrup/ink synthesis). Occasionally risks self-indulgence but redeems through tonal discipline.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work in symbiosis rather than checklist fulfillment. Word limit feels deliberate, forcing thematic compression. Leaves haunting, cerebral aftertaste without feeling incomplete or forced.</comment>
