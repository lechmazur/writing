<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation (legacy of compassion vs dangerous knowledge) is clear, but backstory remains vague beyond war trauma. The bent fork as a symbol of "mend, not break" effectively shapes his actions, though the "aimlessly passionate" trait feels underdeveloped compared to his calculated demeanor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from descent to revelation, with the paper airplane's flight as compelling action-driver. The connection between childhood innocence (airplane) and adult purpose (formula) creates emotional arc. Pacing is tight for word count, though the corridor's "laughter" and lectern discovery feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is richly realized through sensory contrasts: rusted pipes vs phosphorescent fungus, stagnant air vs shimmering opal corridor. The subterranean colosseum's graffiti and leaf patterns create haunting atmosphere that directly supports the theme of finding meaning in decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolic objects (fork as tuning key, airplane as legacy) and layered metaphors (light that heals vs burns). Ending achieves thematic resonance but slightly sentimentalizes the protagonist's choice. Conflict (knowledge vs responsibility) is implied more than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique combinations (arrows made from fork tines, formulas spun in moonlight). Some phrases ("sleeping leviathan") verge on overused, but "creased nose trembled" and "leaf-constellations" show originality. Emotional nuance emerges through actions (lowering the arrow), not just stated motives.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated: setting serves theme, objects carry symbolic weight, and timeframe focuses narrative. The brief length feels purposeful, with the airplane's flight anchoring the compressed arc. Leaves lingering questions about the world beyond ruins, suggesting deeper subtext.</comment>
