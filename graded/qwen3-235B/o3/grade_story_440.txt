<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Predictable "labyrinth" and "whispered timelines" phrasing clashes with fresh "carbonfold katana"/"recycled silence" inventions; tone walks line between visionary and overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements fused with surgical precision; brevity serves as thematic compression rather than limitation; leaves lingering unease about art's capacity for quiet revolution.</comment>
