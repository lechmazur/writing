<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (guardian of wisdom) align consistently with practical/musician traits, though nuance in emotional evolution feels slightly abstract rather than embodied through specific reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot structure driven by stripped screw problem shows cause-effect clarity, though the chord-progression desk unlock feels slightly contrived despite fitting steampunk logic. Pacing balances tight word count effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine library integrates vibrantly with street fairs above - sensory details (creaking gears, phosphor ink, steam sighs) immerse readers without overwhelming narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (stripped screw as "precisely imperfect," music/machinery harmony) create resonant theme about flawed beauty. Ending achieves emotional payoff through symbolic belonging rather than melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fewer clich√©s than average: combines familiar tropes (secret compartments, eccentric archivists) with fresh specifics (proto-language cylinders, tri-wing driver). Occasional adverb overload ("breathless longing tempered by purposeful breath") approaches purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere through theme of intentional imperfection. Brief format enhances tension through compression rather than limitation. Submarine's mechanical personification ("portholes blossomed") elevates craft.</comment>
