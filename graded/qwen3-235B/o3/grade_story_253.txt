<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rowan's "polite bandit" traits shape his paradoxical charisma, but the narrator's motivation lacks depth beyond curiosity. Actions align with assigned traits, though allegiances theme feels underexplored in personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression through the harp-driven time manipulation creates cohesion, but pacing stumbles in rival confrontation setup. The chip-driven inciting incident and resolution function logically, though temporal logic requires unearned leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Electronic wilderness offers rich visual texture with silicon leaves and neon birds, but temporal framework remains abstract. Sensory details emphasize sight/sound, leaving tactile/thematic elements underdeveloped despite atmospheric congruence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "seconds stacked as translucent cards" create visceral time manipulation. Ending lands with resonant ambiguity but sacrifices emotional depth for poetic density. Theme of fractured loyalty is provocative yet under-interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with "misaligned harp" mechanic but slips into ornate descriptors ("modem chatter"). Unpredictable element combinations (school/cyber-refuge) contrast with AI-like abrupt shifts in rivalry reveal. Emotional nuance remains surface-driven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere through strong central motifs, though timeframe/harmony feel loosely integrated. Brief length serves surreal atmosphere well, leaving haunting questions about time ethics without didactic resolution. Some assigned components sit uneasily within the world.</comment>
