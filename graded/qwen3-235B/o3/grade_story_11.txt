<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait 'flighty' is embodied in poetic restlessness rather than concrete behavior; motivations (legacy, anger) are clear but occasionally abstracted through metaphor to the detriment of psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by symbolic revelations adheres to arc (tension → revelation → transformation), though the compressed initiation sequence occasionally sacrifices emotional payoff for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gilded hall's ultraviolet murals and tactile details (grease, marble) create immersive mysticism; atmospheric tone occasionally overwritten (e.g., 'dawn feathered the city').</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (charting interstices between hearts) and resonant subtext about reconciling multiplicity achieve thematic heft, though some imagery borders on self-indulgent (shimmering constellations of grease).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic AI rhythms through inventive metaphors (compass missing north) and nuanced emotional tension; occasional purple prose ('shining glass') barely avoids pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as organic metaphors (patch as legacy bridge), though some (secret society mechanics) remain underexplored; cohesion achieved with minor narrative compromises.</comment>
