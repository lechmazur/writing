<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's alchemical drive is implied but lacks psychological depth; motivation to decode cipher is goal-driven but under-explored; 'suburban alchemist' premise promising but underutilized</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic quest structure but suffers from compressed pacing; cause/effect connections exist but feel strained by 500-word constraint</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with industrial decay vs. suburban fragility contrast; sensory details immersive but thematic grounding uneven</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique alchemy-suburbia fusion; occasional ornate phrasing risks preciousness but never devolves into formulaic patterns</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ambitious concept integration creates tension but occasionally fractures coherence; thematic promise outweighs execution flaws</comment>
