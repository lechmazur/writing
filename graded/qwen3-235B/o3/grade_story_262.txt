<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mr. Vega/Khariel's dual identity and internal conflict are compellingly conveyed through lyrical introspection, but his transformation from arrogant extractor to collaborative ally feels condensed rather than earned. His use of sonic methods aligns with his alien heritage, but the righteously flawed attribute could be more consistently demonstrated through concrete failures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Puzzle tile discovery initiates the plot, organ resonance drives revelation, and collective overcoming of fear provides resolution. Pacing is efficient yet occasionally breathless; the transition from individual discovery to group transformation requires more psychological nuance within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vaulted baths with steam, celestial harmonics, and subsonic organ vibrations create an immersive atmosphere where historical fragility and possibility coexist. Sensory details like wax-sealed scrolls popping open harmonize with the setting's revivalist energy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fear-as-plaster metaphor and knowledge-as-steam imagery resonate powerfully. The ending's thematic convergence of cosmic empathy and cultural preservation feels both earned and moving despite slight predictability in the redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly specific metaphors (e.g., "spectral ribbons of steam") avoid cliché, while spiritual-technological fusion feels genuinely inventive. Some overreliance on alliteration ("cascading concerts") but generally avoids purple prose. Emotional shifts are shown through synchronized heartbeats rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven—each component (disguised alien, organ resonance, Roman revival) serves multiple narrative functions. The contemplative ending lingers while maintaining formal discipline.</comment>
