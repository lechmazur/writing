<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth; motivations implied through symbolism rather than organic character development. Actions align with solitude but inner conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc exists but transitions feel rushed. Confessions to pigments leap lacks narrative scaffolding. Cause/effect logical but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric setting vividly rendered through sharp imagery (e.g., "micro-meteor tears"). Atmosphere leans poetic but occasionally overrides plot grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors undercut by abstract emotional beats. Ending resonates conceptually but not viscerally. Theme of artistic transcendence clear but unevenly earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original setting concepts counterbalanced by overreliance on lyrical abstraction ("chromatic echo," "color orbiting"). Emotional subtext hinted but not fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor unifies disparate elements, but brevity prevents deeper thematic excavation. Lingering poignancy in artistic sacrifice concept.</comment>
