<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character’s somnambulist trait is integral to action and tone, but humility feels underexplored beyond dialogue; the internal conflict is implied rather than deepened, slightly weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres tightly to constraints, with clear progression from embarkation to discovery to departure; pacing is fluid but leaves little room for tension beyond external dangers, slightly flattening stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere synergize brilliantly: decayed lab, humming insects, and eerie moss create visceral immersion; tone balances wonder and melancholy without veering into overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., “topographic veins,” “hand-stitched constellations”) elevates theme of organic memory; ending is poignant but risks vagueness in theme’s philosophical scope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending science and spirituality, but occasional phrases (“green silence”) border on cliché; emotional depth is shown through action rather than stated, though some sections lean on lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, evocative narrative; the brevity amplifies focus but hints at untapped potential in character depth; lingering questions about legacy and decay feel intentional.</comment>
