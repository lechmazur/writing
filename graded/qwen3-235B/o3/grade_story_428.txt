<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but emotional depth limited; Rajiv's transformation from idealist to conflicted survivor lacks layered exploration of internal conflict. Actions align with traits but lack nuanced human contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence with beginning-middle-end, but pacing strains under word constraints—lightning/tunnel revelation feels rushed. Concept drives plot effectively but cause-effect logic occasionally strained (e.g. blotter's awakening lacks buildup).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting as atmospheric crucible excels—temple's sensory decay mirrors Rajiv's psychological/civilizational disillusionment. Connections between architecture, sky maps, and character's past feel organically symbolic. Indian temple details evoke specificity rather than generic mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical heft in ink/constellation parallels and "brokenness" as metaphor for human/cosmic systems. Emotional impact diminished by occasionally ornate prose ("soldered time," "leaking gold") that disrupts immersion. Ending resonates thematically but feels narratively abrupt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through unique cultural-mythic fusion but contains occasional purple prose ("monsoon breath," "fractures for strategy"). Character reasoning occasionally over-explains ("debase heritage for survival") rather than emerging organically. Subtext about idealism vs. pragmatism shows ingenuity despite uneven stylistic control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically despite tight constraints—blotter's transformation and celestial-terrestrial mapping create satisfying throughlines. Story feels purposefully brief but resolution sacrifices deeper exploration of Rajiv's ideological shift. Lingering questions about collective survival vs. individualism suggest thematic ambition.</comment>
