<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and harsh compassion are well-integrated with her actions, but emotional depth feels selectively curated rather than organically developed. The connection between her motivation and the compass's pull lacks psychological complexity in pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive but relies heavily on poetic symbolism to mask compressed pacing. The arc from mapping to catharsis requires more incremental emotional stakes to fully satisfy within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is stunningly realized with layered sensory details that perfectly mirror thematic concerns. The psychedelic decay of the rave space as a repository for suppressed memory is viscerally evoked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dazzling use of metaphor and subtext elevates the narrative beyond surface plot. The tension between movement as both armor and healing mechanism resonates deeply. Ending achieves tragicomic transcendence without didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>While mostly original in concept, the dancer/visionary trope has precedents. Sensory descriptions avoid clich√©s though occasional phrases ("mercy to pirouette") strain for poetic effect. Emotional shifts feel earned rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are meticulously woven together without artificiality. The brevity feels purposeful, with each detail serving multiple thematic functions. Leaves a haunting afterimage of unresolved grief transformed.</comment>
