<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ildra's meekness and sincerity are central to her identity, but her internal transformation is too condensed. While her actions align with her motive (regaining the lullaby), her character lacks multidimensionality or flaws that would make her memorable. Her "peculiarly sincere" voice is distinctive but feels more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story achieves a clear arc (arrival-attempt-resolution) but occasionally rushes transitional moments (e.g., the dissolved tapestry's societal impact). The method of solving the riddle via light reflection is unique and thematically resonant, though the cause-effect chain between her action and the tapestry’s unraveling could use more causal weight within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underground goblin city is richly atmospheric, with sensory details like "phosphorescent stalactites" and ventilation-shaft playground sounds creating tension between decay and childlike vitality. The setting’s contrast with Ildra’s humanity elevates her quest, though the goblins’ hierarchical structure remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The metaphor-laden prose ("moonless color writhed like nerves," "tapestry dissolved into forgiving dust") elevates the story’s philosophical themes of memory and connection. The ending avoids sentimentality, resolving the central tension through emotional resonance rather than spectacle, while the child’s-eye-view lens adds universality to the "universal riddle."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clichés (a meek necromancer subverts typical undead-conqueror tropes), some phrases verge on ornate ("lantern glimmers scattering into prismatic syllables") without adding narrative heft. The dialogue-free structure relies entirely on description, which occasionally prioritizes style over emotional nuance, though the subtext of mourning-as-collaboration feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements serve the story thematically: the goblin city’s paradoxical vitality/deathfulness mirrors Ildra’s necromancy; the broken pen’s reflective nib ties to her nonviolent method. While the word limit constrains secondary character development, the brevity itself becomes a strength, echoing the story’s emphasis on minimalism and simplicity.</comment>
