<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations around 'inddefinitely absolute' wordplay are clear, but emotional depth feels surface-level. The crossword obsession lacks nuanced internal conflict or psychological complexity beyond ritualistic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a tidy arc but feels slightly mechanical. The 500-word constraint forces abrupt transitions between diary rewriting and spectral reconciliation without fully developing cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details like "crackling thunderclaps" of pages and "luminous anagrams," but the "starless sky" timeframe remains underexploited as a symbolic device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and recursive themes of language as salvation stand out. The ending's dissolution into "liberated seeds" achieves poetic resonance, though some emotional beats rely on abstract statements rather than visceral imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Originality shines in using crosswords as metaphysical therapy, but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing that draws attention to its own cleverness rather than deepening narrative authenticity.</grade>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a striking concept but lack narrative tension. The story's brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, leaving conceptual ambitions underexplored.</comment>
