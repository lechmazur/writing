<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (subconscious mind) drives his actions, but "skittish" trait inconsistently applied; emotional depth exists but lacks nuance in border-crossing calloused feet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear arc from secret entrance to holographic revolution, but the loom's memory-release mechanism feels under-explained; pacing balanced but some leaps in plot logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breathtaking sensory fusion of lunar colony (aftershave/floor polish) and barbershop hush; contrast between rustic and technical elements creates immersive, thematically rich atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor layers (subconscious as loom, grace as ancestral thread) create subtext; emotionally resonant ending feels earned, though dialogue feels perfunctory rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No predictable tropes detected; some phrases ("reuniting estranged siblings") border on clich√© but fresh combinations (rustic vs cybernetic) and avoidance of genre formulas raise originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive whole despite ambitious density; lunar setting feels more atmospheric than plot-shaping; leaves philosophical question about hidden potential in mundane structures.</comment>
