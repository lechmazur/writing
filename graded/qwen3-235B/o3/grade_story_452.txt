<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's softheartedness shown but lacks emotional depth; motivation tied to cosmic plot feels abstract rather than personally urgent. Actions (e.g., arresting with apologies) don't fully integrate with grand stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on unexplained cosmic mechanics; pacing unevenâ€”buildup to metaphysical transformation strains credibility within word limit. Resolution satisfying but underdeveloped; cause/effect logic obscured by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cyberpunk and planetarium atmospheres vividly rendered through sensory details (rain-streaked alleys, holographic billboards), but the "muted euphoria" tone occasionally feels imposed rather than earned through narrative immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (badge as counterweight, belt/star symbology) and poetic imagery elevate the narrative. Ending resonates as transcendent yet grounded in thematic coherence with identity and cosmic balance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echoes of cyberpunk/planetary tropes with novel cosmic twists, but language sometimes veers into ornate abstraction ("rethreaded the sky's tangled yarn"). Subtextual depth contrasts with occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements tightly woven into mytho-poetic arc, though thematic ambition occasionally outpaces emotional payoff. The fusion of cyberpunk grit and cosmic mysticism lingers provocatively despite some undercooked aspects.</comment>
