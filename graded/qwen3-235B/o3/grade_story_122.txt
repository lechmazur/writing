<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (defying storm) is clear but lacks psychological dimension beyond stoic determination; "cyber-templar" label isn't fully interrogated, and collision-with-reality metaphor remains abstract despite vivid voice</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows tight storm-reading-lightning-reflection structure with cause-effect clarity, but the word limit forces compressed characterization of the cosmic conflict; resolution feels earned but contextually underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie fusion of cybernetic and sacred elements creates immersive atmosphere; bone-white terraces, upward-raining auroras, and firmware litanies provide visceral, original sensory cohesion between setting and metaphysical stakes</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of paradoxical imagery (e.g., "patiently frantic," "euphoric agitation") and thematic interplay between circuitry and belief; ending delivers satisfying catharsis while preserving mythic ambiguity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original metaphors avoid banality; "hunger halo" storm and prismatic "carousel of impossible geometry" particularly inventive; stylized prose balances audacity with purposeful specificity without devolving into ornamentation</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Multi-layered narrative synthesizes assigned elements into cohesive mythopoeia; while some components (sky burial site) contribute more atmospherically than structurally, the story transcends its constraints through symbolic economy</comment>
