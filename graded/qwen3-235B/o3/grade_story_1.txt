<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are inconsistently grounded; phobias shape his actions but the transformation through unraveling knots and dancing feels abstract rather than emotionally authentic. Stunt skills are underutilized thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in key moments (e.g., lantern extinguishing), leaving some cause-effect relationships underdeveloped. The arc from phobia to rebirth is clear but lacks nuanced pacing within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, eerie sensory details enhance the pyramid’s atmosphere, but the Nevada setting feels disconnected from the ancient, unearthly tone, slightly undermining immersion for literal-minded readers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., tax codes as spellwork) and symbolic gestures (dancing in tar) create resonance. The ending’s thematic payoff—fear replaced by emptiness—is memorable but risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrases. The pyramid library and stunt-double concept are inventive. Some imagery verges on ornate, but the voice remains distinctive and purposefully strange without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate well, though garage sales and “mundanely spiritual” feel loosely tied. The brevity feels intentional, and the story’s ambiguity lingers intriguingly despite minor cohesion gaps.</comment>
