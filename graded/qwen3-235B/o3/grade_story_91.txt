<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but thinly developed; the "quiet revolution" remains abstract rather than visceral, with emotional interiority sacrificed for poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Central action is conceptually cohesive but structurally compressed; cause-effect logic holds despite the constrained word count, though the arc feels abbreviated rather than fully resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered through tactile imagery (razor-wire, fedora holes) and juxtaposition of mechanical/organic elements, creating immersive, haunting mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and inventive metaphors ("pressure needles trembling like tuning forks") create powerful emotional undertow; ending achieves thematic resonance through poetic compression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original within constraints of prompt, with fresh metaphors and thematic ambition; some phrasing risks ornamental excess but never collapses into clich√© or mechanical repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere more through poetic logic than narrative necessity, with occasional tension between thematic ambition and structural brevity.</comment>
