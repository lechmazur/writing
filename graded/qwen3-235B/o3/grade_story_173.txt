<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the protagonist's connection to leaves and motivation to reclaim routes are implied, her "trustworthy unique" trait remains nebulous. Motivation through ancestral wisdom lacks concrete emotional grounding, and the underdeveloped phantom interaction limits character depth despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear throughline from leaf-divination to map-reclamation, with phantom hand as logical yet magical catalyst. Pacing accelerates during vault sequences but maintains coherence. Concept integration (multiverse futures shaping plot) slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drowned city evokes haunting beauty through tactile details (inkless signatures, algae-covered counters). Tone contrasts bureaucratic decay with cosmic wonder, though multiverse undercurrent remains atmospheric whisper rather than immersive force. Sensory alchemy elevates worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with memorable metaphors ("seawater sighing like an audience"). Subtext about knowledge's costs resonates through browning leaves. Ending achieves circularity while avoiding neat resolution, balancing closure and mystery. Emotional impact lingers conceptually.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Uncommon combinations (bureaucratic phantoms, floating atolls) avoid tropes. Occasionally leans on ornate descriptors but maintains distinctive voice. Emotional nuance emerges through gestures (registrar's fading touch) rather than exposition, though kitchen-table motif borders on repetitive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into cohesive myth-mechanic hybrid. Multiverse and underwater setting serve thematic resonance rather than spectacle. Ending's cyclical implication rewards reflection, though slight unevenness in integrating ancestral wisdom detracts from seamless effect.</comment>
