<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (saving brother) is clear but underdeveloped beyond surface desperation; reactions to stamps and multiverse mechanics lack psychological nuance; voice remains neutral, uninflected by personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Multiworld plot executes cleanly within constraints despite rushed hospital resolution; time pause as plot device and stamp mechanics create logical cause-effect; however, abrupt transition to post-war post office strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive details (paper-cut reefs, methane flowers) create rich biopunk texture; "dissonant calm" tone grounds surrealism; some sensory overload risks overshadowing narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Molecular metaphor (stamps as quantum threads) elevates plot conceptually; bureaucratic bureaucracy vs. existential disease theme resonates tragically; emotional impact through action over exposition;</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic multiverse tropes through mycological surrealism; bureaucracy-meets-quantum-trading has conceptual rigor; minimal purple prose despite ornate descriptors; emotional stakes implied rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements fuse thematically (patents as interdimensional trade licenses); brevity sharpens focus on core paradox; linguistic density rewards re-reading; haunting final image of depleted yet empowered clerk subverts expected triumph.</comment>
