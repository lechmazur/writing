<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has layered motivation (nostalgia + directive) that informs actions, but emotional nuance feels more mechanical than psychologically resonant, with human-like behaviors sketched rather than deeply inhabited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crystal fizz as inciting incident cleanly activates tight three-act structure within constraints, though resolution through telescope alignment risks feeling overly contrived without deeper explanation of technical logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually rich setting merging steampunk and high-tech elements creates immersive, conflicted atmosphere—floating lab vs hollow mountain—enhanced by precise sensory details like "rose light" and "glassy gratitude" post-crisis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors ("champagne warning of ruin") and thematic tension between logic/emotion resonate, though closing lullaby veers toward sentimentality rather than earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes by blending anti-gravity concepts with emotional android, but some phrases ("courageous stutter") border on ornamental abstraction rather than organic nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around betrayal prediction as thematic spine, with brevity serving tension rather than limiting it; lingering questions about crystal sentience and human shortsightedness invite reflection.</comment>
