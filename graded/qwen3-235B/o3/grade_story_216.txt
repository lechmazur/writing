<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's unique profession as a scapegoat is intriguingly tied to his identity crisis, but motivations occasionally feel abstract rather than viscerally grounded in relatable human conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of retrieval, decoding, and transformation, but transitions between key moments (e.g., the washer's revelation, confrontation with the librarian) feel slightly rushed due to word constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a tightly thematic narrative with lyrical precision; the cloud city framework and scapegoat premise serve both plot and subtext, though the ending's transformation feels somewhat abrupt.</comment>
