<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbols than fully realized individuals; Kavi's "playful" trait lacks behavioral evidence, Mara's transformation feels abrupt with minimal psychological groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative flows logically from ritual preparation to completion, but compressed structure leaves pivotal emotional shifts underdeveloped; cosmic cartography climax feels rushed despite strong atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive with kinetic imagery ("sound spiraled into geometry the ear could feel"), though some details verge on excessive ornamentation; setting functions as active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic depth compensate for thin emotional resonance; theme of sacred mapping resonates but subtext remains surface-level; ending achieves poetic closure but lacks narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate description ("philosopher's dew") that feels self-indulgent; character logic sufficiently individualized but not deeply interrogated; emotional responses could benefit from showing rather than subtle implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds structural execution; assigned elements cleverly integrated but not always thematically unified; atmospheric density occasionally impedes narrative clarity; memorable but imperfectly balanced.</comment>
