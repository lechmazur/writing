<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct voice and introspective motivation established, but emotional evolution remains surface-level; actions align with traits but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but strained by abrupt shifts; the pivotal ghost-summoning moment lacks build-up, while the resolution feels rushed despite strong thematic symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (burnt sugar, frost-liquefying warmth) masterfully merge decay and nostalgia; atmosphere wholly supports narrative tone and thematic tension between past and present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance (amber as emotional conduit, thawing heart as self-liberation) elevates the narrative; ending feels earned but slightly predictable in its emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, specific imagery avoids cliche, but occasional ornate phrasing ("freckled horizon") borders on affectation; emotional subtext is nuanced but occasionally undercut by explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into a thematically rich narrative; each detail (letter, amber, Carnival decay) contributes to layered exploration of legacy and self-determination.</comment>
