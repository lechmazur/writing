<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's voice is distinct and motivations are clear (healing old wounds), but depth is slightly constrained by brevity. Internal conflict and use of objects (pendant, spellbook) reveal layered emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with purposeful progression from intrusion to resolution. Some reliance on condensed exposition ("reverse the room’s first lullaby") slightly strains pacing but remains coherent within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and thematically resonant—e.g., "spider silk silence," "unicorn rug," and storm vs. stillness. Setting and sensory details amplify emotional and supernatural tensions without overloading.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Potent use of metaphor (pendant as "impatient monarch," dust as memory) and subtext. Ending balances closure with ambiguity, leaving thematic resonance. Dialogue-free yet emotionally layered through internalized tension and generational echoes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Fresh, precise imagery ("stuffed bears frozen mid-hug," "constellations" of dust) avoids clichés. Emotional nuance (sardonic glee shifting to resigned amusement) feels human. No artificial pacing glitches or generic transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve the cohesive whole without feel of arbitrary checklist. Economy of language feels intentional, not restrictive. Leaves lingering questions about memory, inheritance, and reconciliation.</comment>
