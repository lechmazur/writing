<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s ghost-seer identity is underexplored; motivations tied to ‘dissonance of silence’ are implied but not deeply internalized. Actions reflect traits but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels slightly rushed due to word constraints. The beginning-end connection (silence to peace) is clear, but key transitions (e.g., ghost’s release) lack emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid, eerie sensory details (e.g., ‘hourglass snow’). Settings (elevator shafts, lab) enhance tone, but the lab’s ‘paradoxical aridity’ isn’t fully reconciled with its seaside location.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (sand castles, flower crown) and lyrical prose elevates theme. Ending is satisfying, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract phrasing (‘complex simplicity’).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasionally verges on poetic overindulgence (‘murmurless breeze that carried salt away’). Subtext about impermanence is fresh, though some descriptions feel overly wrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements but occasionally prioritizes style over clarity. The final image leaves a contemplative impression, though the brevity limits deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
