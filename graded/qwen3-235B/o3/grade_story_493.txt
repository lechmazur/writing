<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation (ancestry) is clear but lacks emotional depth; "prudent" trait inconsistently manifests, while cheerfulness feels arbitrarily tied to cosmic revelation rather than human psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect (ring → hidden door → revelation) but resolution feels abrupt; the circular return to the tram provides closure, though the compressed arc occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges ancient and futuristic elements through sensory contrasts (salt stains/ho-lo-ads, primordial circuitry/frescoes), creating a lived-in world where history and modernity coexist antagonistically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of ancestral purpose and hidden kinship resonate through layered symbolism; quieter emotional beats (e.g., dying nuns' whispers) outweigh overt telling, though final ascent risks sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of Minoan myth and cyberpunk avoids most clichés but occasionally succumbs to ornate excess ("torchlight blooming," "metal scroll") and underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements feel interwoven rather than additive, with ending's philosophical shift achieving narrative cohesion; brevity challenges full thematic unpacking but suits mythic tone.</comment>
