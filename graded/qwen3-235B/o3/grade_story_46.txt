<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's blankness hinders emotional engagement; motivation to learn "language of dreams" feels abstract, lacking tangible actions or reactions that fully clarify internal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot resolves with thematic clarity (shard as key to unraveling truth), but the surreal progression sacrifices concrete cause-effect; brief glimpses of arc strained by compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles—waterfalls, moonlit vectors, and fronds immerse through lyrical sensory detail; setting isn't just backdrop but active participant, shaping tone and logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (cheap ring framing "extravagant truths") and haunting imagery; subtext about hidden realities enriches, though emotional resonance is muted by stylization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in concept and cohesion; avoids cliché by redefining "madness" and "rumors," though occasional overwrought phrases ("surgical, precise madness") flirt with pretension without derailing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified dreamscape, but the story leans too heavily on lyricism over narrative momentum; brevity feels limiting, not deliberate artistry.</comment>
