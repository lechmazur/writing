<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt motivates plot but lacks psychological depth; voice remains consistently poetic yet distant, preventing full emotional investment; relationships to elements (violin, seeds) show symbolic resonance but not complex humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear journey structured around symbolic acts; plot progression relies on convenient events (meteor shower) but gains momentum through mythic imagery; redemption arc cohesive despite compressed scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory worldbuilding (mist-ocean, holographic cuneiform, refreezing violin) creates immersive dissonance between sterile museum and organic restoration; setting as character in itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("drones bargaining germinated pods") deepen thematic harmony; ending achieves emotional closure through ecological rebirth; subtext of human arrogance vs. natural resilience resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elevated prose occasionally veers toward ornateness ("canopy choirs," "logically illogical") but generally avoids clich√©; emotional arcs feel earned rather than formulaic; synthesis of Mesopotamian motifs and climate grief remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements interwoven purposefully but not irreducibly; brevity necessitates abstraction; lingering reflection on ecological complicity suggests lasting impact despite compact form.</comment>
