<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and consistent motivation tied to war trauma, but internal conflict remains more evocative than fully developed within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visionary resolution connects tightly to opening through symbolic transformation, though some cause-effect links between mirror distortions and character's actions rely on poetic abstraction rather than strict narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Derelict station masterfully evokes sensory decay - broken light patterns, sonic silences, phantom presences - creating atmospheric tension that mirrors character's psychological state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("wounds knitting in silence") and ritualistic symbolism create memorable impact, though subtext about artistic mastery as healing remains somewhat explicit rather than fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors avoid clich√© but occasional over-ornamentation ("porcelain shattering footfalls") veers toward self-conscious stylization that distracts from raw emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion between war imagery and redemption arc, with tightly woven elements creating resonant meditation on transforming trauma through deliberate, painful artistry.</comment>
