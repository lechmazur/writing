<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's role as dream interpreter is central but underexplored; motivation to rewrite laws feels externally imposed rather than organically tied to personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but the method of impersonation lacks sufficient logistical or emotional complexity within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (hissing pipes, sweating metal) create a palpable, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors the theme of rigid laws congealing like steam.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (laws as mineralized statutes, rewritten clauses as vapor) elevate the narrative; ending resonates thematically but sacrifices emotional depth for conceptual elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of bureaucratic surrealism and steampunk aesthetics, though some phrases ("holy mist," "liberated scripture") verge on overwrought symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole; brevity enhances urgency but limits full exploration of paradoxical legal/dream intersections.</comment>
