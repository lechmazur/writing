<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's fear of homogenization drives plot, but inner conflict lacks depth; interactions with Vera imply growth, yet transformation feels abrupt. Voice is distinctive through radio metaphor but underdeveloped elsewhere.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot pivots on relinquishing fear through cooking/chess metaphor; cause-effect between nightmare and resolution is logical but rushed. Pacing manages tight word limit with minor jarring shifts in scene transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid, surreal setting (grotto, constellatory soup) immerses but occasionally overwhelms; sensory details like "nebula-fruit" enhance theme, but "living shadows" judgment feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (diversity as "transmitter," chess-soup mirroring) deepen theme effectively. Ending ties arc together, but nightmare "unclenching" verges on stating emotions rather than showing through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh use of celestial cooking class and pawnless chess enriches narrative. Overly ornate phrasing ("quiet rebellion of the senses") occasionally veers toward purple prose, but inventive combinations mostly avoid clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around diversity theme cohesively, though some (e.g., cooking class run-in) stretch plausibility. Style serves concept overall, with lingering resonance in puzzle-as-solution motif.</comment>
