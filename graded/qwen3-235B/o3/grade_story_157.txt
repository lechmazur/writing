<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters remain enigmatic, functioning more as archetypes than fully realized individuals; their motivations are clear but lack emotional depth or evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies heavily on atmospheric momentum; cause-effect is logical yet lacks sufficient stakes to elevate tension beyond novelty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vividly rendered setting with immersive sensory details; the lighthouse’s spectral cartography and rain-as-diary create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere despite tonal dissonance with tailgating backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and lyrical metaphors elevate thematic resonance; the ending’s cyclical imagery and ancestral haunting evoke lingering contemplation of forgotten histories.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors (ink water, rain-pattern cartography) avoid cliché; language balances precision and poeticism; avoids formulaic transitions or overwrought phrasing that could hinder immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements blend innovatively to serve theme; brevity is leveraged for haunting brevity rather than limitation, though character flatness slightly dilutes overall impact.</comment>
