<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct (awkward inventor's introspective isolation), but motivations around regret remain abstract without concrete past examples to ground the cynicism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot's diner-to-whistle trajectory feels inevitable despite tight constraints, though the leap to "harvested silence" lacks intermediate stakes to heighten tension during the decryption process.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory textures (neon reflections on aluminum, clanging pans as metronome) immerse readers, yet some metaphors ("vibrate as if whistle already sits between ketchup and sugar") strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphorically rich ("sawdust of remorse") with a resonant theme of recursive self-reinvention; the ending avoids neat closure while maintaining emotional momentum through cyclical imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through the unconventional "reap silence" concept; some ornate phrasing ("anxious fireflies refusing sleep") risks poetic excess but overall maintains stylistic consistency and emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a melancholic philosophical parable, though brevity occasionally sacrifices deeper exploration of the archive's mystery or the whistle's historical lineage.</comment>
