<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (forgiveness to avoid self-destruction) are clear but lack psychological depth; reactions to the cursed chest hint at buried regret but remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight redemptive arc with vivid cause/effect between objects/concepts; hallucination sequence resolves internal/external conflicts cohesively within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Richly textured setting merges decay with mysticism; sensory details (cedar rot, coolant incense) and liminal spaces amplify bittersweet tonality throughout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (recipes as combat, memory as food) are strikingly original; theme of forgiveness as self-liberation resonates through layered subtext and symbolic action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("specters of spices") approaches purple prose; character reasoning leans on archetypal logic, though conceptual fusion of culinary/combat traditions feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a unified allegory; brevity accentuates mythic tone; leaves lingering questions about redemption's permanence and the priest's role.</comment>
