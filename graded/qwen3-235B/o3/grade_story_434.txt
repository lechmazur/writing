<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters remain enigmatic rather than fully developed; Silas' actions align with his desperation but lack psychological depth, while "commonly individual" performers are referenced but underutilized as distinct entities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains momentum and circular structure within constraints, though Azure's betrayal feels hastily integrated; flame's role as catalyst lacks sufficient setup despite effective pacing in climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (gravity-defying flame, spectral guilt as sonic texture) create immersive, paradoxical space where "playful dread" manifests through sensory contradictions rather than explicit explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symbolism of burning loyalties into vinyl has conceptual heft, but emotional stakes rely on abstraction rather than earned character connections; ending confirms control yet evokes emptiness beneath the ritual's success.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal mechanics (zero-gravity confession booth, treasonous subliminal recordings), though occasional metaphor clusters ("feral shadows," "swallow on a wire") verge on excessive; maintains consistent eerie tone throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive mythos about artistic control and illusory unity; some mechanical connections (flame's map, spiral's sentience) stretch plausibility, but compact form enhances haunting ambiguity about storytelling as manipulation.</comment>
