<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Character's motivations (doubt/shame) are consistently shown through actions (stitching cradles, memorizing letters), but internal monologue lacks sufficient nuance. The herbalist's academic/artistic duality is effective, though transformative arc feels slightly rushed in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from shame to revelation to successful restoration. Connection between opening stone-setting and closing tide-hearing is strong. Pacing uneven in midsection, with engineers' transition feeling abrupt. Assigned elements shape plot but aren't fully exploited narratively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting of coral restoration station is vividly rendered with precise sensory details (saltwind, bioluminescent larvae, barnacled ledger). The abandoned seawall timeframe reinforces themes of renewal. Atmosphere perfectly complements tone of breathless longing through urgent, fluid prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story employs rich metaphors (doubt's heart, phosphorescent larvae as scattered stitches) and creates haunting imagery. Deeper theme of mending as belonging resonates strongly. Ending feels earned rather than contrived. Literary devices elevate without overshadowing emotional core.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Conceptual freshness in combining coral restoration with textile mending. Avoids predictable arcs through focus on doubt-as-partner-to-hope. Prose is lyrical without becoming purple, though some phrases (e.g., "relentless mending of what breaks") verge on sentimentality. Emotional depth achieved through symbolic action rather than explicit telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified exploration of healing-as-process. Breach between science and art is navigated elegantly. Narrative compression works for thematic intensity. Leaves lingering meditation on imperfection and persistence. Perhaps slightly too thematic in expense of narrative urgency.</comment>
