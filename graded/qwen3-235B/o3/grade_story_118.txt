<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Characters serve thematic purposes more than evolving naturally. Liora's motivation to "anchor the ephemeral" is conceptually clear but her agency feels abstract, not emotionally grounded. Dr. Chorus lacks individualized voice despite being a hive-mind, reducing psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on surreal mechanics (candle wax coding) that drive action but strain logic. The vault chase lacks foreshadowed stakes or resolution. Pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative clarity, creating a fragmented arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie, oppressive atmosphere thrives via sensory details (glittering sprinklers, wax "coded shapes"). The "secret agent" setting is underutilized commercially but effectively mingles bureaucratic grit with metaphysical dread, enhancing thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("merry bitterness," wax as confession) create haunting impact. Subtext around memory as rebellion resonates, though the ending's "diagnosis" risks over-explanation. Tension arises from conceptual stakes rather than character emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avant-garde approach avoids clich√©s but flirts with pretension ("warm static" consciousness). Emotional resonance is muted; Liora's resolve is stated rather than earned. The wax method feels both inventive and arbitrarily mystical, undermining internal logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story prioritizes mood over cohesion. Assigned elements are tightly woven into symbolism but occasionally overwhelm plot logic. The ending lingers thematically but sacrifices emotional payoff. Stylistic ambition compensates for some structural weaknesses.</comment>
