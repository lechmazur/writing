<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rationale and motivation are clear, but deeper character complexity remains underexplored beyond the sister plotline. Puppeteering ties coherently to the climax but feels underutilized thematically until the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical sequence with strong cause-effect, but the final resolution feels slightly compressed. Some transitional leaps (e.g., immediate recognition of musical notation in tears) risk undermining pacing precision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid textural details create mood, but temporal logic falters (how does a modern puppeteer access an ancient intact temple?). Atmospheric strengths outweigh this chronological dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lacrimal musical notation and "stitched by negative space" demonstrate poetic originality. The ending leans toward sentimentality with its "resolve to create" conclusion, slightly diluting the story's earlier haunting ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by reinventing "truth hunt" tropes through tactile metaphors. Minimal purple prose; metaphors like "sandpaper yearning to speak" show linguistic boldness without excessive ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements work in concert rather than in service—the gown's revelation transcends gimmickry. The condensed format amplifies emotional economy, though some contextual gaps (syndicate backstory) remain intriguingly unelaborated.</comment>
