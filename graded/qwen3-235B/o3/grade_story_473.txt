<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Reed's eccentricity and unpredictability are emphasized, but his motivation to outmaneuver fate feels underexplored beyond surface declarations. His actions (e.g., hidden disclaimers, swapped diagrams) align with his traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot adheres to a workshop structure but struggles with pacing in the word limit. The thematic thread of leadership transfer is coherent but underdeveloped; the climax (swapping compasses for handshakes) lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Alluring juxtaposition of orchard and solar panels creates a distinctive visual atmosphere, but fails to fully integrate technology-nature tensions into character or theme. Sensory details are vivid yet sporadic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose effectively equates mapmaking with destiny-shaping. The theme of participatory leadership has resonance, though exposition-heavy delivery occasionally undermines subtlety. Ending achieves poetic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avant-garde structure and rich neologisms ("solar sea") demonstrate originality. Some overwritten descriptions risk pretension, but the Meridian Fold's cryptographic elements feel genuinely innovative rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion between mapped elements, but sacrifices emotional immediacy for allegorical complexity. The brevity serves thematic ambiguity but hinders character engagement.</comment>
