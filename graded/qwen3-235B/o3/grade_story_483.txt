<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's weariness and desire for freedom are clear and consistent; motivations are revealed through symbolic interactions with the card and Mira, though emotional depth could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from patrol to transformation, but the word limit strains causal connections (e.g., rapid shift from meeting Mira to abandoning the badge). Resolutions feel slightly rushed despite poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Desert setting, cracked-garden imagery, and lava lamps create an immersive, melancholic-hopeful atmosphere; sensory details (e.g., gasoline-and-basil scent) vividly anchor tone and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (badge, card) and metaphor (lamps mirroring life's chaos); ending evokes thematic resonance, though emotional impact is slightly undercut by compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with lava lamps and card symbolism, but the "redemptive sheriff" trope is slightly predictable. Prose is poetic without excess; subtext relies more on imagery than nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Skillfully combines assigned elements into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative; brevity enhances poetic weight but slightly weakens emotional payoff in key transitions.</comment>
