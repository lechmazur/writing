<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strengths in integrating Torhild's dual identity as brewer and linguist to drive action, but character depth is limited by brevity; Gudgeon's loyalty lacks emotional nuance despite symbolic significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clever compression of plot into a compact arc with clear progression from discovery to resolution; occasional narrative leaps (poster decryption to coordinates) feel slightly contrived but forgiven for poetic momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory synthesis of industrial decay and linguistic fragility through icy brine smells, metallic sounds, and tactile frost imagery; setting becomes active participant in extinction-of-language theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (dialect vials as spirits, foams resurrecting speech) transcend gimmickry to explore memory/timeliness; some thematic oversaturation weakens final emotional punch despite potent subtext on preservation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in combining steampunk-linguistics fusion avoids genre clich√©s, but occasional over-verbalization ("brass lungs humming") and compressed psychology border on ornamental excess without losing narrative voice coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around elegiac theme with mechanical precision; brevity amplifies tension between impermanence and preservation rather than restricting it; lingering questions about Torhild's personal stakes undercut maximal impact.</comment>
