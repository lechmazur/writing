<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Helix's "proudly humble" attribute blends with his psychic genealogy quest, but emotional depth feels surface-level. Motivations align with actions, yet inner conflicts lack nuanced exploration. Salvara's transformation hinges on underdeveloped backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot uses tight cause-and-effect (dice→escape→broadcast), but pacing stumbles during transitions (guard's nostalgia, breakfast mutiny reference). Resolution feels abrupt despite clever integration of elements like the poetic trigger.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ethereal space-pirate setting uses vivid fragments (cocoa steam, chipped die) but lacks immersive consistency. The nebula and asteroid-archipelago history create intriguing texture but feel underexploited for atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (destiny as dice, heartbreak as alarm bells) resonate. Emotional impact hinges on symbolic resolution rather than character interiority. Ending's shift from cosmic fade to morning light evokes thematic closure with poetic economy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original cosmic-genealogy twist avoids genre clichés. Avoids "tell"-heavy emotional cues; psychic projection through board game nostalgia feels fresh. Language occasionally tips into ornate imagery but mostly serves the story's mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interweave purposefully (dice connect plot, theme, and resolution). Some gaps in narrative efficiency (brief mutiny reference), but the tight word count prioritizes symbolic momentum over exhaustive explanation. Lingers with its existential-hope paradox.</comment>
