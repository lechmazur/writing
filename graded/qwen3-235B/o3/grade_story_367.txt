<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (studying tides for herbalism) is clear and consistent, but lacks psychological depth beyond obsession. His "fervent indifference" voice is distinct but underdeveloped thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from frustration to revelation via the goose, but the abrupt cost-of-perfection ending feels underprepared. Pacing manages compression but resolution lacks weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on vivid sensory contrasts (glass/sound/smell) and setting-plot integration. The observatory's liminality enhances thematic tension between control and surrender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (perfection as "migrating ghost") and subtext about creative surrender resonate. Ending balances poetic closure with lingering ambiguity. Technical craft elevates the narrative philosophy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Largely avoids clich√©d phrasing; metaphors like "thoughtfully thoughtless" are conceptually rich. Some overprecision in descriptions risks ornateness but serves thematic purpose. Emotional resonance through symbolic action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively within constraints - the tight focus feels intentional. Story transcends premise through philosophical depth. Minor pacing unevenness prevents higher score.</comment>
