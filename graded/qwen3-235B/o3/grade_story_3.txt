<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's surliness defines his initial relationship to the supernatural setting, but introspection feels abbreviated; the transformation is conveyed through action but lacks emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Riddle drives plot forward organically; yarn-reading method is logically integrated. Pacing is tight but sacrifices depth in character resolution; ending ties to cosmic theme feels abrupt yet conceptually coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile imagery (salted mist, figureheads) merges with cosmic abstraction to create haunting atmosphere; tone of dignified chaos permeates setting descriptions but occasionally overshadows character focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (cosmic commerce, expectation as thread) create intellectual resonance, but emotional impact is subdued; endingâ€™s thematic synthesis is memorable, though some ideas (e.g., "larger patterns") feel stated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original cosmic-market framework avoids genre tropes; language is occasionally overwritten ("serenely frantic wind") but mostly purposeful. Sensory details (burning lanterns, tightened yarn) feel specific rather than generic, with minimal AI-like repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are used organically (e.g., yarn as both object and narrative key); brevity enhances mythic tone rather than limiting depth. Central theme of interconnected systems emerges clearly, leaving contemplative afterimage.</comment>
