<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but "uncommonly typical" feels underutilized. The first-person voice is distinct but lacks deeper emotional nuance in internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive with clear progression, but the Guardians’ hesitation and choice feel slightly rushed within the word limit. The coil’s role ties the arc together.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in the capsule hotel enhance atmosphere, but some elements (e.g., "wet visors") lean abstract. Tension between clinical setting and mythic "well" is effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., "binary dust") and thematic depth (truth vs. authority) elevate impact. Ending resonates with hope without resolving all conflicts, balancing closure and open-endedness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original concept with inventive integration of elements (e.g., quantum whispers, makeshift well). A few phrases (e.g., "arrested meteors") border on ornate, but emotional subtext avoids formulaic AI patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements integrate logically without feeling contrived. Style maintains clarity despite complexity. Lingering resonance through thematic ambiguity justifies the tight format.</comment>
