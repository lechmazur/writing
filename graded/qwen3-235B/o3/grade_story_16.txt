<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations lack depth; freelancer trait superficially applied. Groom's emotional arc feels rushed, though motivations align with actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot uses tight structure efficiently but falters with sudden groom conflict. Resolution ties back but feels expedited; pacing mostly controlled yet strained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (steam, metal) establish atmosphere, but steampunk elements remain superficially tied to themes. Wedding setting contributes context but lacks integration with core ideas.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "amber ring as bottled dusk") enhance impact. Ending resonates thematically; emotional beats balanced between showing (engine harmonies) and telling (elder wisdom). Subtextual depth elevates craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concept fresh (mechanical memory, breathing techniques), but some phrasing ("scattered harmony") risks clich√©. Groom's weeping feels emotionally genuine but predictable. Prose occasionally luxuriates in ornamentation without sufficient payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively into a thematically rich whole, though compression causes minor pacing issues. Constraints used inventively, but not all components achieve maximum narrative synergy.</comment>
