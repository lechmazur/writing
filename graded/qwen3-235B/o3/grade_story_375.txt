<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation remains consistent and well-connected to assigned traits but lacks depth in emotional development and lacks meaningful transformation despite the thematic closure in the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear beginning-middle-end progression, but the surreal mannequin scenes feel compressed rather than integrated, slightly disrupting narrative momentum within the tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details and atmospheric descriptors create powerful immersion; decayed beauty and cosmic resonance are thematically reinforced through setting elements, though some descriptions verge on excessive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language and symbolic resonance elevate the story's thematic weight; the ending's philosophical shift from wrath to beauty delivers emotional impact, though some poetic flourishes risk ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through cosmic/surreal fusion; while occasionally indulgent in style, the mannequin device and imperfection-as-aesthetic concept demonstrate originality within a recognizable emotional framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively with thematic consistency, but the brevity occasionally flattens complex ideas; the story delivers intellectual resonance but lacks deeper narrative layers that would make it transcendent.</comment>
