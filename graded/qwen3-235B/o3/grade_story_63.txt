<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits like humility and pride are woven into Mira’s actions, but her internal conflict remains underexplored despite her pivotal decision to defy archivists. Dal’s comedic role lacks depth beyond his function in the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mission to mend cuffs drives the plot, and the cause-effect chain (vibrations, scrawls, tuning forks) is inventive, though the abrupt ending—while thematically tied to the ripple effect—feels premature for full narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ethereal sensory details (e.g., “notes shimmering like water droplets,” “stethoscopic lamp”) and the juxtaposition of sterile lab sounds with embroidered artistry create a vivid, haunting atmosphere that deepens the story’s themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ripple effect as a metaphor is poignant but inconsistently “shown,” relying heavily on direct references. The ending’s subtext about cultural preservation resonates, but some lyrical moments tip into overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The blend of sound and needlework is inventive, avoiding clichés. However, phrases like “reversed resonance” and “accidental chord of gratitude” lean on poetic abstraction rather than emotional specificity, slightly veering into ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated into a cohesive whole, with each choice (e.g., the lab, the choir’s timing) feeling purposeful. The short form feels earned, leaving a lingering meditation on legacy and impermanence.</comment>
