<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (atonement for withered orchards) is consistent and ties to actions (sacrificing blood, smashing the skull), but internal depth remains sketchy beneath mythic archetypes. The craftsman's pride in the hammer is underdeveloped despite its centrality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (quest → conflict → subversive resolution) within tight constraints. The smugglers' threat ties to the black-market method but feels somewhat underexplored. Pacing is tense but logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (copper strings, peach-blossom scent) create an immersive, mythic atmosphere. The "hush where past meets prophecy" ties setting and timeframe to the theme, though smugglers' presence strains cohesion slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (lullabies as seeds, destruction as preservation) layer meaning. Emotional resonance stems from showing, not telling. The ending's theme of renewal through sacrifice is haunting and satisfying.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing with unique imagery (e.g., "children he never fathered singing louder"). No clichés; tone remains consistent. Some descriptors (like "haggard awe") feel slightly labored but not detrimental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into the plot and themes without feeling imposed. The concise form amplifies tension and thematic clarity. Leaves lingering questions about preservation vs. exploitation.</comment>
