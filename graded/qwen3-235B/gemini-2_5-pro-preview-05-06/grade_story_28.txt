<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth, feeling more like narrative contrivance than authentic personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing struggles under time constraints; the assigned concept (regional folklore) and timeframe create tension, but forced urgency undermines organic plot progression and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere achieved through specific sensory details (peeling paint, dancing shadows) but regional folklore elements remain superficially sketched rather than organically embedded in setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of light/shadow glyph provides thematic weight, but emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on adverbial tells ("desperate optimism") rather than earned subtext or nuanced characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases like "oddly usual" and "desperate optimism" feel formulaic; fork's significance relies on lore dumps rather than organic revelation, with predictable tension-rescue structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story integrates required elements but with uneven cohesion; compact structure serves plot mechanics better than thematic resonance or character complexity, lacking lingering impact.</comment>
