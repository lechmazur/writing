<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character exhibits partial depth with brewing-related metaphors and internal monologue hinting at values, but motivation feels somewhat stated rather than organically demonstrated. Grogginess lacks consistent integration with actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within word limit but lacks clear arc progression. The decision to 'initiate' feels disconnected from concrete action. Pacing balanced but resolution remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective sensory contrasts (protest chants vs. graveyard silence) enhance mood. While haunted mansion relies on familiar imagery, atmosphere works synergistically with thematic darkness and rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like brewing as rebellion and mirror reflection exhibit craftsmanship. Tone supports thematic tension, but emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral. Ending lacks concrete resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic writing but contains minor clich√©d phrases ("encroaching darkness"). Combines brewing activism with supernatural elements inventively, though generic protest framing weakens uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively with occasional forced connections. Writing style serves content effectively, but compressed form feels like a limitation rather than an artistic choice. Final reflection hints at thematic potential without full realization.</comment>
