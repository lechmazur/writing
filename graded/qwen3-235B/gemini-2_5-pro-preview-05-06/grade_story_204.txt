<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is defined by profession and prejudice; transformation shown but lacks deeper exploration of psychological underpinnings tied to her work. Motivation clear but insufficiently tied to visceral personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Circular structure with symbolic resolution within word limit; pace feels compressed, some causal connections between market encounter and hangar arrival rushed. Concept of decay drives plot but lacks deeper exploration of how community functions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory atmosphere immerses reader in decayed spaceport; floral notes against rust create haunting contrast. Tone of wistful resilience aligns with theme but timeframe of "hush" doesn't fully integrate with setting's spatial grandeur.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (decaying plaster as prejudice, phantom punch as belonging) layered and resonant. Subtext on sterile vs organic connection profound yet subtle. Ending resolves internal arc effectively but underdevelops wider thematic implications.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids decay clich√©s through nuanced "beauty in entropy" lens; avoids overused sentimentalism about marginalized communities. Minor purple prose tendencies ("cathedral of decay") undercut otherwise precise imagery. Emotional subtext shown through environment/ease of inhabitants rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements serve theme cohesively; brevity enhances focused emotional journey. Some surface-level utilization of "ancient novelty" trope; spaceport's sci-fi potential underexploited. Lingering questions about transformation's permanence create thoughtful resonance.</comment>
