<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Shaky trait inconsistently manifested; his recklessness dominates while vulnerability remains surface-level. Motivation to "make peace" lacks specific backstory, but the amber's tactile handling subtly reveals his emotional investment through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Procedural climb resolves too neatly, with underdeveloped "improbable rumor" mechanism. The cyclical "Begin" ending conceptually ties together but relies on thematic abstraction rather than narrative logic. Pacing unevenly stretches atmosphere while compressing emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Decaying cathedral-as-art-space provides rich, layered sensory environment with scent of incense/aerosol and visual contrast between ruins and murals. "Echoing hour" timeframe poorly integrated spatially, but the amber's fragility meaningfully mirrors the crumbling setting's tension between destruction and creation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of trapped spider versus revealed "Begin" creates thematic resonance about unresolved journeys. Subtext of impermanence works through physical setting, though emotional beats ("unexpected lightness") often declared rather than dramatized. Writing style balances lyricism with precision in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clich√©s through poetic grit but occasionally veers into aestheticized decay tropes. The climbing sequence shows authentic tension, while the "seraph" mural feels generically spiritual. Metaphorical choices mostly specific (amber relic) rather than generic ("fragile seed of hope" risks predictability).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Element integration mostly coherent but relies heavily on atmospheric cohesion rather than narrative necessity. The brevity serves metaphorical economy well, though the ending's thematic reversal requires more earned emotional weight. Lingering ambiguity about "beginning" works conceptually but not viscerally.</comment>
