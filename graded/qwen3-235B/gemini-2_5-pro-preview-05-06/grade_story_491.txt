<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's serene nature isn't sufficiently integrated with his actions or the narrative arc; motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or nuance despite consistent focus.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through the quilt-unraveling action, but the tight word limit leaves the ending feeling abrupt despite clear structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with tactile and visual details (e.g., "fossilized leaves," "shimmering fabric"), though the greenhouse's extinct plants feel underutilized as symbolic witnesses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (quilt as concealment/art) and subtext about hidden truths; ending balances resolution with lingering mystery, though deeper emotional resonance is muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing ("silent, verdant tomb") borders on purple prose; the wristband and quilt feel original but occasionally verge on trope-heavy (e.g., "relic of past seekers").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the theme of concealed knowledge, though the brief length limits deeper exploration of character and setting; concept feels more prioritized than emotional impact.</comment>
