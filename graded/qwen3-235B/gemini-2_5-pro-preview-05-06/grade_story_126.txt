<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "aloof passion" are stated but underdeveloped beyond surface descriptions; motivation is clear but lacks psychological nuance; actions aligned with traits but felt overly symbolic rather than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action drives plot efficiently but feels slightly rushed in the ascent sequence; cause-effect logical but pivotal moments (e.g., panel opening) lack visceral impact; pacing uneven but generally effective within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative descriptors of desolation and artificiality create strong mood; atmosphere deeply supports theme; connections between object (archaic churn), setting (degenerated station), and timeframe (post-greenery erasure) are striking and conceptually rich.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses potent metaphors (e.g., illusion vs. reality) with some memorable imagery (dust motes in light); lacks deeper subtext engagement despite clear central conflict; ending purposeful but emotionally distant rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh object/setting interplay avoids tropes; some overly ornate phrases ("recycled air sighed") risk purple prose; emotional descriptions lean on abstraction ("contained energy") rather than physicality; maintains consistent thematic tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around existential truth-seeking theme; length enhances tension rather than feels restrictive; butter churn/poster combination demonstrates ingenuity; leaves lingering questions about collective denial rather than closure.</comment>
