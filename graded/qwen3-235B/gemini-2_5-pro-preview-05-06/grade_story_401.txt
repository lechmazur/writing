<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are deeply woven, with the captain's story mirroring Elias's arc. The redemption shift feels slightly rushed but emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight, with a coherent arc from guilt to resolution. The decoding process is condensed, slightly undercutting the methodical effort required.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (eerie ballroom, tactile blanket), but sensory details beyond sight/touch are sparse, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through subtext; the blanket-as-diary metaphor and layered themes of reconciliation elevate the narrative. Ending is poignant and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the crocheted code and emotional subtext. Prose avoids clich√©s, though "manic clarity" leans slightly on abstract phrasing rather than embodied tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story integrates all elements cohesively, with the theme of reconciliation persisting beyond the ending. Each decision feels deliberate, though the word limit slightly limits character nuance.</comment>
