<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (kissing madness' horizon) is hinted but underexplored; "fiercely nonchalant" portrayal lacks nuanced internal conflict; actions align with external presentation but lack psychological depth beyond archetypal eccentricity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within tight constraints; action (performance) drives plot coherently; sudden shift from mundane to cosmic horror risks pacing dissonance but maintains momentum through visceral sensory escalation</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Steampunk airship details create immersive, cohesive atmosphere; gaslight chiaroscuro enhances psychological tension; ozone scent and sonic descriptions effectively materialize metaphysical concepts</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (pulsing glyphs, discordant symphony) create lingering unease; ending's cosmic horror subtext transcends gimmickry; tension between control and surrender permeates subtext; show-don't-tell principles consistently upheld</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through atypical execution (tinderbox over musical instrument), but some steampunk conventions (brass/mahogany) verge on expected; language purposeful but occasionally overelaborated ("discordant symphony")</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole despite procedural limitations; brevity serves ritualistic focus; atmosphere/character/method interdependence creates conceptual echo chamber</comment>
