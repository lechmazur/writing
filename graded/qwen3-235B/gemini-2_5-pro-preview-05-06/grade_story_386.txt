<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflicts remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a tight arc but feels occasionally rushed; cause-effect is logical, though cosmic alignment's significance could be clarified.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered, particularly the atom-powered lighthouse and celestial mechanics, though "line that never moves" lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly descriptive prose; ending feels thematically satisfying but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh imagery, but risks purple prose and occasionally generic emotional descriptors. Avoids clich√©s but doesn't subvert them radically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Most elements cohere well, though the timeframe and "borrowed dawn" tone feel inconsistently nuanced. Lingering thematic questions emerge but could be sharper.</comment>
