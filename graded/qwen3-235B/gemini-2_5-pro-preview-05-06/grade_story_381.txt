<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation to map is clear but underdeveloped; necromancer aspect remains superficially utilized. Shared movie ritual with Pip adds intriguing layer but lacks deep integration with core traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mission-driven plot flows logically through exploration action, but resolution feels too minimal for narrative closure. Pacing is concise yet leaves little emotional or structural residue. Begins and ends ambiguously.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystalline cave imagery is vivid and immersive, with effective sensory details. Fusion of sci-fi and necromantic elements feels inconsistent; tonal clash between "hushed" demeanor and futuristic nostalgia occasionally undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (cap, sound of resolve) and subtextual themes of human connection. Writing style elevates tension, though limited conflict scope restricts deeper emotional impact. Dialogue feels purposeful and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by combining necromancy with sci-fi; old-movie ritual feels fresh. Minimal purple prose; tone and voice remain consistent. Some transitional phrasing leans slightly formulaic, but overall originality stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements bind together through shared purpose, though some (necromancy) feel peripheral. Brevity serves atmospheric focus rather than plot development. Lingering thematic resonance about persistence elevates the piece beyond its technical execution.</comment>
