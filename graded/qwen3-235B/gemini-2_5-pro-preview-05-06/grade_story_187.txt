<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent but lack emotional depth; internal conflict is hinted at but underdeveloped. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive arc but pacing feels slightly rushed; narrative jumps between abstract concepts and concrete details disrupt momentum. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details ground the atmosphere but some fantastical elements feel underexplored; "mesmerizingly bland" contrasts effectively yet lacks follow-through. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative but uneven integration creates fissures; ending's thematic resonance compensates for minor underdeveloped nuances. </comment>
