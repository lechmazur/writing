<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are partially realized; motivation is clear but not deeply explored through nuanced actions; the object's impact on internal struggle is effective but character voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong opening and resolution tie together, but action progression feels static despite atmospheric momentum; cause-and-effect is present but underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric execution outweighs conventional character development; premise elevates tight structure beyond typical post-apocalyptic tropes but lacks transformative impact.</comment>
