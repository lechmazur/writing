<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract, passive force without discernible personality or interiority, despite heavy thematic burden. Motivation is stated rather than dramatized through tangible stakes or personal risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot contains logical cause/effect but feels condensed to the point of conceptual whiplash. The whale's song and plastic whistle lack mechanical integration in the story's magical logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</comment><grade>Evocative coastal imagery anchors the reader, but the haunted lighthouse lacks specificity beyond atmospheric shorthand. Object/setting relationship inconsistently developed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism enriches narrative with mythscape qualities. Ends ambiguously, prompting philosophical reflection. Occasional purple prose undermines some metaphors' emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by overfamiliar tropes (impotent ancient guardians, mystical oceans). The plastic whistle's innovation contrasts with predictable "wisdom of the deep" platitudes. Emotional beats often stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story coheres conceptually but sacrifices emotional immediacy. Elements strain toward mythic weight while constrained by artificial word compression. Lingering conceptual resonance outweighs technical flaws.</comment>
