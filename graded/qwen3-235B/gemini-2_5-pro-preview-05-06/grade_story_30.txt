<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's gambling and telekinesis are underutilized; motivation drives actions but psychological depth feels surface-level, relying on nostalgic backstory rather than present decisions revealing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot uses tight space efficiently: conflict with captain, hidden tapestry, flame reveal create forward motion; resolution intentionally open-ended but maintains structural coherence despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory collisions (flickering holoscreens vs. fragile tapestry) create immersive tension; atmosphere of sacred disorder and desperate hope permeates every element, enhancing both setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (hope as starship fuel, dying vines as cultural extinction) resonate; emotional impact emerges through showing (chemical flame revealing glyphs) rather than stating; theme of preservation vs. entropy feels resonant and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi and archaic elements avoids genre tropes; language remains purposeful without excessive ornamentation; character reasoning contains human nuance in balancing desperation with calculated risk.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesion; brevity feels purposeful; lingering questions about cultural preservation and sacrifice arise naturally from content/method integration.</comment>
