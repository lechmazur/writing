<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lord Ashworth's yielding nature and aristocratic background shape his tactics, but his internal conflict feels underexplored. Motivation to protect the bird is clear, yet his aristocratic privilege as a lens for empathy remains shallowly rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics are clever (eavesdropping → ventilation sabotage), but rely on contrived coincidences (precise knowledge of wiring). Pacing feels rushed in midsection, yet the tight structure achieves completion within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setting's metallic ductwork and echo chambers create atmosphere, but sensory details are overly sparse. The clandestine lab's menace contrasts with Ashworth's "flower chap" façade, yet worldbuilding remains superficially sketched.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subverts expectations through ironic reversal (liquidator liquified). Strong use of symbolism (roses as metaphor for vulnerability). Ending resonates thematically, though emotional beats could be more subtly "shown" than summarized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through tonal paradox (florist vs. agents of chaos). Echamber eavesdropping mechanism shows ingenuity. Language remains purposeful without excessive ornament, though occasional phrase "botherations" borders on whimsical affectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere surprisingly well within tight constraints. Submissive hero's journey via mundane tools feels fresh, though some connections (mother's influence) remain dangling threads. Conceptual elegance outweighs minor structural compression issues.</comment>
