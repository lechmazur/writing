<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arc from brittle desperation to quiet acceptance is coherent within constraints, though transition from prophecy fragments to resolution feels slightly compressed. Pacing mostly controlled but occasionally rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery and snow-bound setting masterfully mirror character's psyche through crystalline imagery, frost motifs, and transient beauty. Sensory details precise and hauntingly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematic unity about power as surrender. Brief format enhances focus on interior transformation rather than plot mechanics. Conclusion lingers thematically.</comment>
