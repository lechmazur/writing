<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight, coherent arc within constraints; fusion method aligns logically with speculative elements; cause/effect of unleashing the storm and glyph formation are clear; pacing deliberately bridges contemplation and climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges sensory contrasts (sterile/yeasty, cosmic/intimate) masterfully; setting as both literal and metaphorical liminal space; celestial and culinary imagery deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
