<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Thistlewick’s mania and vulnerability are vivid, his obsession with the cap revealing both madness and desperation for meaning; motivations align with eccentric traits, though interiority occasionally veers overly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tension between man and jungle drives plot, but the arc feels truncated; uprooting the vine and later confession connect structurally, though pacing dips between action and reflection within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Victorian parlor’s decay against the jungle’s encroachment is richly textured, with humidity, light, and plant life evocatively rendered; tone balances oppressive heat with intellectual detachment for thematic contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elicits unease through metaphor (cap as “navel of the New World”), and the confession scene’s rawness adds emotional weight; subtext on faith and insignificance is potent, though ending slightly over-explains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concept given depth through specific, odd details (bottle cap theology); avoids clichés with precise, grotesque imagery (“strangler fig tendril”); language is lush without veering into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interweave cohesively—zealotry, jungle-parlor contrast, sacred ordinary object—though the whispered confession’s role in the arc could be tighter; leaves lingering questions about futility vs. transcendence.</comment>
