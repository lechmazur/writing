<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation feels underexplored; loyalty to the Wardens informs actions, but internal conflict lacks depth in driving decisions or reactions to unfolding events</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot remains static, lacks clear arc; tension introduced isn't resolved or escalated meaningfully within constraints; coherence suffers from abrupt shifts between observation and radicalization</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere excels through sensory details (flickering lights, oil lamp, radio) and symbolic moths; setting enhances thematic decay but doesn't fully integrate with narrative momentum</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective use of labyrinth and coded humor as metaphors; prompts reflection on radicalization mechanisms, though emotional resonance diluted by heavy exposition</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original radicalization premise avoids clich√©s; poetic yet occasionally overwrought phrasing ("sanctified dread") risks overshadowing subtlety in favor of mood</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere and concept elevate story, but limited cohesion between elements (e.g., moth observation tangential to plot) and underdeveloped character weaken overall impact</comment>
