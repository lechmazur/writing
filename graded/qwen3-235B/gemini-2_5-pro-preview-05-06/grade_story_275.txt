<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The hermit’s motivation is clear but remains abstract; their actions illustrate persistence but lack psychological depth or internal conflict that would fully realize their personality. The connection between the weathervane and album to their deeper identity isn’t deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from the hermit’s ritual to the sprout’s emergence, but the arc is minimal. The weathervane method and comet’s role are cohesive, but the tightly constrained word limit leaves the emotional payoff underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., skeletal trees, comet’s glow). The setting’s desolation directly informs the hermit’s struggle and the story’s tone of existential defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (e.g., weathervane as a bridge between cosmic and mortal), but emotional resonance is muted. The ending is poignant but doesn’t fully amplify the story’s deeper themes of rebellion or hope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Purposeful prose avoids overt clichés, though phrases like “conscious turning away from easier worlds” risk abstraction. The weathervane and comet are inventive; the hermit’s silence and lack of subtext prevent over-explaining, but at the cost of nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and atmospheric, though the narrative feels more like a vignette than a fully realized story. The thematic link between mindful effort and life’s persistence is effective but leaves little lingering complexity.</comment>
