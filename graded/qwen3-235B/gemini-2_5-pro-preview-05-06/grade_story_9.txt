<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's panic is consistent but underexplored; motivations align with actions but lack depth. Sarcasm as voice is strong, but emotional nuance is superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Static tension; no progression or resolution within word limit. Coherence exists but lacks structural momentum crucial for tight narrative constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Neon-drenched decay creates visceral atmosphere, but "between lost years" is vague. Sensory details evoke mood, though some elements (billboards) feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose with resonant metaphors ("molten sarcasm") and subtextual environmental themes. Emotional impact diluted by static plot and explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh combinations (soothsayer/puzzle box/environmental collapse). Avoids clich√© despite minor purple prose tendencies; subtext feels intentional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively intertwined but constrained by word limit. Unique tone and existential themes linger, though concision dilutes structural ambition.</comment>
