<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's late-blooming heroism and cosmic motivations feel conceptually cohesive but lack psychological depth; actions are consistent with assigned traits but occasionally flattened by overly lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from discovery to revelation, but the compressed word limit strains cause-effect flow; some transitions between key plot points feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vividly realized post-apocalyptic atmosphere through sensory contrasts (silence of loss vs. shimmering threads); setting directly reinforces cosmic and emotional themes with surgical precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical resonance between cosmic cycles and human suffering; subtext about interconnectedness enriches the narrative, though emotional impact occasionally diluted by dense prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with cosmic web concept; metaphors are fresh but border on ornate; emotional states shown through objects/actions more than explicit tells, with rare lapses into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interweave elegantly (spyglass as both tool and symbol), though brevity occasionally sacrifices character vulnerability; leaves haunting existential questions rather than pat resolutions.</comment>
