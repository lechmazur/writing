<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's vendetta drives the plot, but internal transformation is rushed; motivations and actions align superficially but lack nuanced psychological depth to justify the shift from scorn to righteous purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc (discovery → revelation → counterattack) but compresses exposition-heavy backstory; pacing manages complexity well within constraints but occasionally strains logical transitions between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative in moments (grimy markets, cold locket), but sensory details are unevenly distributed; the rebellion’s impact on the world feels underexplored beyond surface-level references.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storytelling effectively weaves metaphor (edible maps as "seeds of truth") and subtext (revisionist history vs. memory); some emotional beats rely on exposition rather than immersive showing, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise (candy art as anti-historical-revisionism tool) elevates the narrative; however, phrases like "shadowy figures" and "precisely creative fury" flirt with cliché, and emotional stakes occasionally lean on abstract descriptors over visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements balances on a knife’s edge—some threads (e.g., rebellion’s societal impact) feel undercooked; the ending resonates thematically but lacks the precise, haunting craftsmanship it attributes to Silas’s sculptures.</comment>
