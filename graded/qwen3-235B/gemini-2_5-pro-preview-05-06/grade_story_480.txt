<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has surface-level consistency in motivation ("indifferent enthusiasm") and actions, with some voice in the narration, but lacks depth in emotional nuance and internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from gathering end to exorcism, with logical cause-effect, though resolution feels rushed. Efficient within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust, stale air, flickering movement) create a haunting atmosphere that enhances the eerie tone and tension between digital and physical realms.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</comment><grade>Utilizes vivid metaphors ("manufactured ghosts," "digital miasma") and imagery, but lacks emotional depth and thematic complexity to elevate beyond genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√©s but relies on some genre-typical descriptions ("buzzing energy," "subtle manipulations"). Sensory details remain specific, though occasional phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively around the digital-physical tension. Style supports clarity, but the brief length occasionally sacrifices narrative weight for brevity.</comment>
