<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, with practicality and longing forming a believable duality. Reactions to objects (screw, diary) reveal layers, but voice could be more distinct in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tightly structured plot where action drives progression logically. Beginning-to-end cohesion works despite brevity, with effective pacing. Slight abruptness in diary revelation slightly disrupts flow but not enough to significantly harm coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative steampunk atmosphere masterfully blends sensory contrasts (sea salt vs. fair sounds). Setting actively shapes plot and character motivation. Timeframe connection feels somewhat underutilized but atmosphere remains exceptional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in stripped screw as both literal and metaphorical obstacle. Subtext about imperfect genius and legacy resonates emotionally. Ending feels earned and thematic resonance strong, though some emotional beats could be subtler.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh mechanical puzzle-solving. Avoids genre tropes through specific, nuanced execution. No purple prose. Some phrases ("pulse of longing") verge on clich√© but overall distinctive voice maintains authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements seamlessly integrated into cohesive narrative. Word limit used effectively to create contained arc. Memorable theme about unconventional qualification and legacy leaves lingering impact. Minor compression issues don't detract from overall excellence.</comment>
