<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Highly clear motivation and consistent actions, but lacks depth in character traits beyond desperation. Emotional reactions minimal beyond determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong plot arc with beginning/middle/end, cohesive use of assigned elements. Slight pacing unevenness in transition between worlds, but concept logically drives structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the greenhouse setting. Atmosphere of "dissonant calm" is effectively maintained. Timeframe element could be more integrated with tone shifts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and thematic resonance about love transcending boundaries. Some "telling" of emotions, but subtext emerges through altered environments and physical reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original world-weaving premise with fresh metaphors ("spectral herb," "chromatic echoes"). Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally disrupt flow. Avoids genre tropes but lacks deeper emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most elements, though trivia night and "absolutely relative" feel less essential. Style balances clarity and creativity. Lingering questions about realityâ€™s fragility enhance thematic depth.</comment>
