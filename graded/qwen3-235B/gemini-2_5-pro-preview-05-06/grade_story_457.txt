<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strengths in motivation consistency and symbolic object integration; weakened by lack of human reactions or nuanced contradictions in character psyche despite atmospheric context</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacks conventional plot progression but maintains thematic coherence; suffers from static momentum but gains through concept-driven structure within word constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phenomenal sensory layering of nebula's cosmic scale against urban claustrophobia; atmosphere directly enables the theme's philosophical tension through physical/spiritual contrast</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful deployment of ironic juxtaposition through cosmic metaphors; each technical choice (zipper/mycelium/constellations) functions as layered symbol while maintaining narrative pulse</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Demonstrates individuality through paradoxical phrasing; occasional ornate phrasing near nebula descriptions risks becoming self-indulgent; emotional subtext conveyed effectively through metaphor rather than statement</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements into thematic architecture; some elements serve concept more than character logic; creates lingering metaphysical question while maintaining technical cohesion</comment>
