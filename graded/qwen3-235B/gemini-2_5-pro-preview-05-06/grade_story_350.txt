<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivation hinted at but not fully explored. Puppeteer's skills are thematic but mostly symbolic rather than organically shaping actions. Minimal emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression via discovery is logical but rushed. The sequence from gown analysis to hidden compartment is plausible but lacks escalatory moments. Arc established but feels abbreviated, with key revelations feeling abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moonlit temple provides atmosphere, but sensory details feel generic (e.g., "cold lid," "decaying silks"). Setting's historical weight isn't fully utilized to deepen mystery. Tone of intimacy undercut by overly clinical descriptions of discoveries.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Metaphors about light patterns and "silent plays" show promise but lack narrative follow-through. Potential subtext about rewriting history remains underdeveloped. Ending gestures at thematic depth without fully committing to the implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but creates new artificialities. Phrases like "irritatingly perfect" and "symphonies of truth" strain for poetic effect. Motif integration feels mechanical at times, with some descriptions resembling algorithm-generated imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements serve basic narrative function but lack symbiosis. Short form seems like limitation rather than artistic choice. Lingering questions about historical truth lack emotional anchor to create lasting resonance.</comment>
