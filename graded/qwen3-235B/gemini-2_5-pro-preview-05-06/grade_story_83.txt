<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's expertise and motivation are stated but not deeply demonstrated through action; "mischievous wisdom" appears superficially in dialogue but lacks psychological depth. Suspicious trust is minimally explored through posture rather than nuanced decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narrative stalls in atmospheric stasis rather than progressing through meaningful cause-and-effect. The "fateful encounter" lacks transformative impact on character or plot within the constrained word limit, creating a suspended vignette rather than contained arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Autumn decay and fractured mirrors create vivid juxtaposition of organic disintegration and artificial distortion. Sensory details (brittle leaves, whispered secrets) effectively immerse reader, but metaphoric potential of mirrors reflecting protagonist's fragmented identity remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (leaf raking as revelation) and symbolic objects (burn patterns as narrative) suggest layered meaning, but emotional resonance undermined by over-reliance on abstract phrases rather than embodied experience. Conceptual themes surface in dialogue rather than organic emergence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Candle-wick divination shows originality, but "whispering secrets" and "decaying grandeur" lean on clich√©. Language avoids purple prose but veers toward affectless precision; atmosphere feels consciously constructed rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements like mirrors and candle form cohesive aesthetic whole but serve more as symbolic furniture than narrative engine. Ambiguous conclusion suggests thematic ambition but sacrifices emotional closure; length feels restrictive rather than deliberate.</comment>
