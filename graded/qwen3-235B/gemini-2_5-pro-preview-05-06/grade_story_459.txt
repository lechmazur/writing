<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character motivation and fragility are well-developed, though Alistair's internal logic occasionally veers toward abstract introspection rather than grounded human nuance, slightly weakening full emotional immersion in his struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot achieves coherence within the word limit, but the rapid pivot from observation to catharsis feels compressed; the cause-and-effect between his actions (dissecting ghosts) and resolution (the nod to the flower-crown ghost) lacks incremental buildup, diluting emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., "saline air," brittle sandcastles) and symbolic alignment between setting and theme (impermanence) are strong, though the lab’s spectral mechanics (why ghosts congregate there) remain underexplored, slightly weakening atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor ("dissonance of silence") and subtext (shared human/ghost fragility) elevates the story. The ending’s quiet shift from silence to "quiet harmony" is emotionally resonant, though first-person narration’s introspective tone occasionally overexplains rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The premise avoids overt clichés, with fresh angles on ghostly interaction (e.g., dissection via tour stalking). No formulaic phrasing; sensory details (flower crown’s fading, spectral fragility) are evocative. Only minor risk of slight "literary" affectation in phrasing ("spectral sighs screaming in the void") is offset by overall originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements are integrated, but the story leans more on thematic resonance than narrative urgency. The brevity works thematically but limits deeper exploration of Alistair’s internal shifts; the ending lingers thoughtfully but feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
