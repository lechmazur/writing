<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Finch's amiable nature and scholarly curiosity are evident, but his emotional depth remains underexplored. His calm reaction to supernatural phenomena aligns with his motivation, yet his internal logic when "deciphering" the timbers lacks human nuance, veering into overly poetic abstraction rather than grounded intellectual process.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vibration-driven plot creates momentum, with clear progression from contemplation to revelation. However, the abrupt transition from "hours passing" to dawn feels artificially imposed rather than organically earned within the tight word limit, slightly undermining narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse's sensory details—creaking timbers, coalescing shadows—are vivid and thematically resonant. However, the "stormy sky" and "salt-stained walls" reference broader contexts without fully integrating them into the immediate atmosphere, leaving some environmental potential unrealized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "language older than stone" are elegant but often prioritize lyricism over emotional urgency. The ending's thematic clarity about bridging past/future satisfies logically but lacks visceral impact. The "waiting room of a new era" conceit feels somewhat abstract rather than poignantly concrete.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most AI signatures, though phrases like "timber's song" border on cliché. The fusion of historical and supernatural elements shows ingenuity, yet the consistent use of passive descriptors ("resonating," "seeping") occasionally muffles immediacy. Emotional stakes remain intellectually articulated rather than viscerally shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story weaves elements cohesively but leans heavily on "haunted location" conventions without fully subverting them. The brevity amplifies thematic elegance but sacrifices deeper character engagement. Lingering resonance lies in its meditation on historical continuity rather than character-specific revelation.</comment>
