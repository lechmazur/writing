<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's guarded nature and skeptically credulous motivation are consistent and drive key decisions, but her internal conflict lacks sufficient depth. The decryption of vows aligns with her extinct craft pursuit, but reactions (e.g., abrupt disillusionment) feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quest for truth propels the plot effectively, with logical cause-effect between elements. However, the compressed arc feels rushed—council's disowning act lacks emotional weight due to limited buildup. Pacing prioritizes revelation over character consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The nano-forest offers intriguing tech-nature juxtaposition with bioluminescent fungi and filtered light, but sensory details remain superficial (over-reliance on sight). The "angry peace" tone is present but not fully integrated into the setting's fabric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. myth resonate through the lies underpinning rebellion. The forged vows-as-movement-origin concept carries meaningful subtext. Ending's bitter resolution shows thematic consistency, but emotional resonance is dampened by rushed pacing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unique elements (data-oak, nano-ecosystem) avoid genre clichés. Cryptography-driven revelation is inventive. Some generic descriptors (e.g., "shimmering pathways") but overall avoids formulaic transitions. The core twist feels human-conceived rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly—the minstrel's craft directly enables the plot's crux. The nano-forest setting's miniaturized scale cleverly mirrors the movement's fractured moral foundation. However, brevity sacrifices atmospheric richness needed to fully realize the "angry peace" concept.</comment>
