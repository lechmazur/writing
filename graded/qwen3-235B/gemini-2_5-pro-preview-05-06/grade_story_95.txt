<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional depth or personal conflict; motivation is clear but underexplored beyond thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; cohesion exists but avoids tension or resolution, relying heavily on atmosphere over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative, especially contrasts between sterile tech and ancient relics, but sensory details unevenly distributed; some elements underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes resonate intellectually; metaphors like "forgotten dance" add depth. However, reliance on poetic abstraction sometimes undermines emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh imagery, but certain phrases ("silent wonder") and narrative loops risk sounding thematic without narrative grit; avoids cliche but lacks sharp human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive but prioritizes mood over meaning; brevity stifles character/plot development. Rich concepts linger without fully crystallizing into lasting impact.</comment>
