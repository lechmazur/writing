<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character is psychologically nuanced, though motivations veer toward abstraction; his reckless focus on fragmented memories aligns with his nobly tragic identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks overt progression but uses tight circular structure effectively; the phoenix realization provides thematic resolution rather than narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through surreal specificity (combustion labs, hummingbird drones); avoids AI-like redundancy while maintaining poetic originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlaced seamlessly into cohesive whole; brevity sharpens thematic focus rather than limiting it; lingers conceptually.</comment>
