<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but underexplored; her “hyperactively serene” veneer lacks consistent embodiment. The sticker sheet as a symbol is potent, but her emotional arc feels compressed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is deliberate but risks stagnation. The mixtapes drive the plot, yet the resolution feels truncated—the hollow victory’s thematic weight isn’t fully unpacked within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Detailed sensory immersion in the steampunk dining hall enhances mood, but the setting occasionally feels decorative rather than integral to the protagonist’s internal journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story evokes melancholy through effective imagery (e.g., “mechanical heartbeat”), but relies on telling rather than showing in pivotal emotional beats. The theme of hollow catharsis lingers, if unevenly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The steampunk-meets-80s nostalgia blend is inventive, but some descriptions veer into ornate abstraction (“savage grace”). Emotional arcs lean on familiar tropes (betrayal, nostalgia) without fully subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack synergy—mixtapes and sticker sheet resonate, while the steampunk hall feels at odds with the intimate emotional core. The brevity is both purposeful and limiting.</comment>
