<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's rigidity is vividly established, but the abrupt shift from bureaucratic dispassion to protective empathy lacks gradual emotional buildup; the motivation shift feels more thematic than psychologically earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative arc is conceptually clear but compressed; discovery of pollen and bulb logically connects, but the pivotal realization feels underexplored, creating a gap between action and thematic revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is richly textured with gothic decay and botanical wonder, though the gravestone-hill context remains underutilized; atmosphere masterfully reinforces tension between order and organic mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of empathy-as-cultivated-phenomenon resonate through metaphor, but emotional impact is diluted by overt thematic exposition; poetic imagery (e.g., "arms of steel") occasionally veers into sentimental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and vivid imagery elevate originality, yet the narrative leans on dramatic epiphany over grounded character psychology; some metaphors ("whispered secrets," "foundations trembling") risk familiar resonance despite fresh context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce conceptually but occasionally strain under their symbolic burden; the fusion of scientific and mystical is inventive, though the brevity leaves theme integration unevenly balanced.</comment>
