<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of submarine's pressure groans and bioluminescent contrast creates immersive atmosphere; setting and tone seamlessly enhance the theme of fragile beauty amid decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., butterflies mapping ley lines) and subtext about control vs. wonder elevate impact, though emotional resonance is occasionally diluted by heavy exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original use of Morse code/micro-atomizers avoids tropes, but occasional over-description ("worn and intricate as brass workings") veers toward formulaic steampunk clich√©s; tone remains consistent yet stylized.</comment>
