<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s secretive nature and role as a pathfinder inform her isolation and methodology, but her emotional shifts feel underexplored. Her aloofness and dedication to preserving folk medicines are consistent, yet her transformation via the hug lacks sufficient groundwork, weakening the emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marathon training and Leo’s subplot create a loose arc, but the progression feels truncated. Key moments (e.g., the hug) lack buildup, and the ending, while thematically resonant, feels abrupt due to the word limit’s constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost train’s sensory details (dust, herbs, disused tracks) immerse readers in a haunting, nostalgic atmosphere. However, the marathon’s connection to mapping green spaces feels underdeveloped, and the interplay between urban decay and herbal preservation could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (teapot as relic, marathon as meditation) effectively to explore legacy and resilience. Shows more than tells, with the hug and playlist hacking as subtlety layered gestures. The theme of preservation resonates, though emotional beats could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Offers ingenuity (playlist hacking) but strains credibility (haunted park lab feels trope-heavy). Prose occasionally leans on ornate descriptors (“angrily peaceful resolve”) rather than concrete specifics, and character reactions (Elara’s softening) lack nuanced interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively on the surface (folk medicine mission ties to setting/method), but some feel mechanical (marathon training’s dual purpose strains plausibility). The ending’s clarity outweighs its slight predictability, leaving a lingering impression of resilience.</comment>
