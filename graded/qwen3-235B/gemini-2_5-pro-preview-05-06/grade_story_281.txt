<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character development is compelling yet uneven; Finn's transformation feels authentic but slightly rushed, while Sparks remains enigmatic without fully fleshing out his influence. The dialogue-driven poetry sessions reveal motivation but lack deeper psychological nuance in how the dummy catalyzes change.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually tight but execution stumbles—causal links between Finn's internal shifts and external actions (e.g., poetry's role) feel underdeveloped. The arc from cynicism to transformation is implied rather than earned within the word limit, leaving tonal shifts abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite atmosphere through tactile details: rust, hums of machinery, static charge around Sparks. The engine room’s decay mirrors Finn’s internal state, while the lighthouse’s liminal space (between docks and haunting) enhances thematic tension between shadow and rebirth. Sensory cohesion is near-flawless.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong craft in metaphor (“rust becoming stardust”) and layered themes of reinvention, but emotional resonance peaks abstractly rather than viscerally. The ending’s quiet epiphany is undercut by a slight didacticism in messaging; dialogue occasionally leans more poetic than organic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés (haunted dummies, redemption arcs) through specific, surreal imagery—yet some phrasing (“grimy film of his past life”) flirts with sentimentality. The dummy’s metaphysical logic feels fresh, though the “shifting from theft to art” trope lacks subversion. Subtext is purposeful but occasionally foregrounded.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a textured whole, though plot momentum leans heavily on thematic abstraction over narrative urgency. The transformation theme is clear but its mechanics remain mystical rather than visceral, leaving a slight gap between concept and execution. Lingering questions about Sparks’ origins may aid or detract from resonance.</comment>
