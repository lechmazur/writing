<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's absent-mindedness and motivation are present but underexplored; his reactions to the archive and encounter hint at depth but lack layered development; voice remains consistent yet feels intentionally restrained rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacing is tight yet fluid; the chance encounter pivots the plot logically toward resolution; beginning (archive) and end (station) connect thematically; concept of human imperfection vs AI efficiency guides arc effectively within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory contrasts (e.g., worn lion knocker vs sterile AI environments) vividly anchor mood; atmosphere of melancholy and quiet defiance enhances theme; setting details feel purposefully chosen to mirror character's inner state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through subtext and symbolism (lion knocker, Hūia bird); ending avoids sentimentality by tying hope to tangible human imperfection; central conflict (individuality vs automation) is clear and thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in framing grief as creative fuel and AI as ambient antagonist; some phrases border on ornate but don't derail flow; avoids clichés through specific details (e.g., kinesthizing extinct bird calls) rather than abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize around central theme; brevity sharpens focus rather than hinders; the juxtaposition of eras (natural vs synthetic) and the quiet climax feel purposeful and poignant.</comment>
