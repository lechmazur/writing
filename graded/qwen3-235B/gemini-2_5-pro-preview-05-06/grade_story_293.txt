<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched but motivation lacks emotional depth; traits like nervousness and insincerity inform actions but inner conflict feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive and urgent within constraints, but lacks a full arc due to limited space; the action drives the narrative effectively but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is richly immersive, with sensory contrasts between decay and artificial light; atmosphere deepens thematic tension but some worldbuilding elements feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors (candle as resolve, bird as defiance) are haunting; poetic language elevates the story, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original concept (bacteria-powered city, clockwork bird) avoids tropes; prose is vivid but sparingly controlled. Some phrasing (e.g., "organic scent") risks vagueness but overall style feels distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gel well overall, though bacterial vats and "cautious revelry" could be more integrated; brevity feels intentional but thematic ambition slightly outpaces execution.</comment>
