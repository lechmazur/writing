<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s meekness and sincerity are consistent, but her internal conflict remains underexplored despite the short form. The broken pen’s symbolic weight is clear, but her necromancer identity feels tangential to the central revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (focus → revelation), but the method of decoding light feels abstract, undermining logical cause-effect. Pacing is economical but occasionally sacrifices depth for concision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The goblin city’s atmosphere is vividly rendered, blending sensory contrasts (playful noise vs. mystic stillness) to amplify tension. The setting enhances both character and concept through deliberate tonal juxtaposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The metaphor of the “tangled tapestry” and light symbolism are evocative, but the theme of interconnectedness leans on familiar mystical tropes. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks emotional gravitas.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, favoring specificity (e.g., “phosphorescent fungus”), though some phrases (“whispers of the departed”) border on generic. The fusion of necromancy and cosmic inquiry feels original but occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates assigned elements into a thematically rich narrative. The brevity feels intentional, but the balance between poetic abstraction and narrative clarity wavers slightly, leaving room for deeper exploration.</comment>
