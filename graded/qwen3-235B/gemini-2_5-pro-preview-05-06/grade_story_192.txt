<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo's craving for connection is clear but thinly rendered; his obsession with poltergeists feels more like plot device than organic motivation. The "eager lookout" trait remains superficial, serving atmosphere over character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sewing box discovery anchors the plot well, but the transition from skeptic to believer feels rushed. The arc from digital ennui to historical connection works structurally but sacrifices narrative complexity for neat resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reimagined Roman villa provides rich sensory contrast between ancient and modern. "Technically organic" residues offer intriguing tactile details, though atmospheric potential of the setting's hybrid identity remains partially unexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Twilight Zone-style supernatural meets modern alienation with effective melancholy. Subtext about digital vs material connection is poignant but telegraphs its themes too overtly in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but relies on familiar haunted object tropes. Phrases like "sterile hum of digitally saturated life" verge on over-refined abstraction, while the poltergeist's "instructional movements" risk feeling overly schematic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of elements creates emotional payoff, though the story occasionally prioritizes atmospheric mood over narrative precision. The brevity feels chosen but highlights underdeveloped character dynamics.</comment>
