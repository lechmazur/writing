<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the shift from "frantic cook" to reality-warping plot subverter lacks nuance. The pencil eraser's symbolic role feels tacked on rather than organically tied to his persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is uneven—discovery/conspiracy progression feels abrupt. The banquet resolution is clever but under-explained. Time compression weakens logical cause/effect between notches and "mass societal delusion."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through oppressive heat and dusty decay, but the earthquake facility's role as a "stage" lacks technical specificity. Sensory details are vivid but sparse in key scenes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (notches as distorted reality-keeping calendars). Ending avoids over-explanation, trusting reader inference. Theme of curated perception shows depth through subtle recipe tampering rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept is original but risks "lone conspiracy theorist" clichés. Language avoids most purple prose, though "centuries of layered dust" repeats unnecessarily. Emotional resonance emerges through actions (not eraser) rather than statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility. The short form works for mystery, but deeper exploration of "impossibly conceivable" mechanics would enhance impact. Ends on provocative ambiguity.</comment>
