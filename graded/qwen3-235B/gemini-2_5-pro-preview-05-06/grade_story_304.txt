<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strength in linking Silas's past (camera lens) to his motivation, but underdevelops internal conflict; motivations are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth despite surface coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sustains tension through precise pacing within constraints; the spider's web pattern feels underexplored but the shuttle timeframe creates effective urgency and narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in baroque asteroid setting; "borrowed starlight" and fractured neon create haunting atmosphere that deepens thematic tension between artifice and authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (crimson on lens = internalized violence) elevate craft, but emotional stakes rely too heavily on declarative statements ("aching need") rather than fully embodied subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Shows originality in concept (assassin with camera lens) but falters with tropish "false prophet" governor and overreliance on nebulae/starlight imagery bordering on poetic redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative purpose but lack symbiosis; the lens is integral while spider-web planning feels artificially imposed rather than organically emerging from character logic.</comment>
