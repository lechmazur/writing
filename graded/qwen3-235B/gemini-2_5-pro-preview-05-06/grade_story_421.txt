<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s nomadic nature shapes her decisions, but motivations remain surface-level; her “ferocuously polite” dialogue works but lacks depth in internalized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on contrived rituals and abrupt twists; the ritual-to-rebellion transition feels rushed, undermining cause-effect logic despite compact structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory texture (smells, tools) and symbolic contrast between workshop and wild, but setting could deepen its thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain under tight word constraints; the resolution lingers thematically yet feels narratively abbreviated.</comment>
