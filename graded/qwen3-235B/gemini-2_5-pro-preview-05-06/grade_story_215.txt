<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Michael's motivations (entwining science/wonder) are clear but under-explored psychologically. "Rattled" surfaces through physical actions (trembling hands), but inner conflict lacks visceral depth. The "inwardly social" trait contradicts more than illuminates his interactions with guarded researchers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The postcard puzzle drives the plot, but progression feels engineered (floorboard note, flyer clues) rather than naturally emerging from setting/character. Pacing unevenly balances dance-studio interludes against rising mystery. The archive revelation completes an arc but risks narrative convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts (clinical facility vs. sweaty dance studio) create unease. Sensory details (scent of floor polish, thumping bass) anchor atmosphere effectively. The "coy aggression" tone is inconsistently applied, mostly evident in dialogue rather than pervasive ambiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dance rhythms as puzzle keys offer clever symbolism, juxtaposing scientific rigidity with embodied movement. Emotional impact resides in the clinical horror of humanless analysis, though underdeveloped thematically. The ending avoids easy resolution but lacks haunting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>AI-like phrasing appears ("pleasingly counterintuitive," "carefully curated information"). The secretive-facility trope resurfaces without meaningful subversion. Sensory details occasionally prioritize novelty over authenticity ("scientific dread" feels imposed rather than earned).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Elements cohere structurally but lack organic synergyâ€”dance lessons feel like narrative scaffolding rather than thematic counterpoint. The brief form limits character depth but suits the puzzle-box plot. Ambitious but uneven, leaving intellectual resonance unfulfilled.</comment>
