<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character is introspective and layered, but motivations rely heavily on abstract concepts without clear behavioral anchoring. Internal consistency is strong but lacks tangible actions that fully reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single contemplative act, creating cohesion but limiting momentum. Symbolism-driven progression works within constraints, though resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with salt, twine textures, and lighthouse rhythms creating palpable isolation. Sensory details elevate setting to near-character status.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (string as emotional burden, lighthouse as cyclical witness) are potent. Ending resonates thematically, though the contemplative tone occasionally veils emotional stakes rather than amplifying them.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through intense psychological focus, but some phrasing ("gnawing awareness," "whisper of past regrets") edges toward abstract overuse. Sensory details feel specific rather than generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite high concept density. Elements serve thematic unity, with the string-as-symbol particularly inspired. Short length feels purposeful, though emotional impact could be more visceral.</comment>
