<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation aligns with sullen demeanor but lacks emotional depth beyond surface traits; Jed remains psychologically flat despite symbolic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is logically coherent but overly accelerated; key transitions (map revelation, journey, arrival) feel slightly perfunctory within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere effectively rendered through sensory precision (salt/ozone, metallic air), though underwater setting remains underdeveloped compared to the rural decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vibrant symbolism (stamps as lies, quilt as guide) elevates narrative; ending resonates thematically with quiet recklessness, though conflict remains interior rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("parched fields against the limitless potential") and familiar tropes (quilt-as-mystery) undercut uniqueness, but metaphors like "borrowed valor" provide fresh tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements cohere through Jed's obsession but occasionally prioritize metaphor over narrative urgency; the brevity sharpens emotional stakes while slightly diluting world-building.</comment>
