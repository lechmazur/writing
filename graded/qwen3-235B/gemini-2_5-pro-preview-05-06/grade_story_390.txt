<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fen’s calmness is integral to her character, driving calculated actions. Motivation (spinning prophecy) is clear and consistent. Her use of symbolism (butterfly method, botanical press) ties to her traits, though internal conflicts are underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant progression through preparation to pressing petals, but the end feels abrupt. The butterfly method shapes the plot but lacks resolution. Pacing is deliberate but slightly rushed in transitions. Causality (press → political influence) is logical yet underdelved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (humidity, rustling orchids, gleaming brass) create a haunting atmosphere. The timeframe (pre-summons tension) and setting (glass conservatory in a palace) complement the tone of impending change. Longing and decay are evocative but occasional clichés dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (wilted bloom as political tool) and metaphors (butterfly patterns as manipulation) deepen subtext. The ending resonates thematically. Emotional restraint (showing, not telling) works well, though the core conflict (prophecy’s manipulation) is subtly implied, not fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh use of botanical press and butterfly patterns avoids cliché. Language is lush but precise; few overly ornate phrases. The narrative’s ingenuity lies in merging botany and political strategy. Subtext about control over fate is nuanced. Mild repetition in describing longing slightly mars originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven—botany as method, palace setting as political stage. The brevity feels purposeful, focused on a pivotal act. Lingering questions about the First Minister’s reaction add depth, though the story’s impact leans heavily on implied consequences rather than explicit stakes.</comment>
