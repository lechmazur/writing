<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation and literal interpretation are clear but lack internal conflict or complexity; actions align with traits but feel functionally driven rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot achieves a tight arc within constraints, but pacing relies heavily on exposition; cause-effect between overcharging and breakthrough feels underdeveloped despite logical surface coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie setting juxtaposes effectively with Elara's clinical focus, but sensory details (cold spots, whispers) remain underexploited as symbolic elements rather than simple atmospheric tools.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Final alignment of star maps as "living network" elevates concept beyond literalism; ending prompts reflection on knowledge's cost, though thematic layering remains more implied than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unique interpretation of symbols (Bell logo) but occasionally slips into efficient-genre mode (haunted lighthouse); prose remains precise without descending into ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements cohere to form functional whole with clear central theme, but some—like the haunting—feel utilitarian rather than organically integrated to the narrative's emotional core.</comment>
