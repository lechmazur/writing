<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s duality as planner/prepper shapes his internal conflict but lacks visceral reactions to objects; motivations are clear but psychological nuance remains underexplored, with introspection feeling occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on implied external deal, but narrative momentum stalls in abstract rumination; structure lacks tangible progression from doubt to action, with cause-effect tied more to atmosphere than concrete events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting’s sensory details (crumbling dome, rosewood) evoke decay and resilience, but temporal urgency of the “handshake” moment feels disconnected from the contemplative temple atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (broken constellations, chains of foresight) deepen themes of control vs. chaos; ending balances melancholy and liberation, though emotional weight leans on intellectualized revelations over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Subverts doomsday tropes via intellectual fragility but falters with occasionally ornate phrasing (“gnawing fear,” “imperceptible shift”); character logic prioritizes philosophical contrast over raw, unpredictable humanity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive metaphorical framework compensates for slight narrative brevity; elements serve thematic unity but occasionally strain under the weight of abstract introspection demanded by the format.</comment>
