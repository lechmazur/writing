<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions, though "skewed visionary" remains under-explored beyond its function in plot mechanics. The dialogue-driven revelation feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherent within constraints but lacks a full arc; the ending resolves nothing while leaving earlier tensions diffuse. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting fusion of clinical anomaly research lab and fading artisanal past creates evocative contrasts. Sensory details (shimmering instability, calloused fingers on shards) ground the uncanny.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (glyphs as displaced "map," cereus cloth as "woven light") exhibit inventive symbolism. Theme of impermanence lingers beyond narrative brevity, though subtext slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing ("mundane miracles" as earned concept, not trope). Emotional resonance emerges through tactile details rather than stated feelings. No detectable formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under assigned frameworkâ€”the anomaly's metaphysical connection to trades feels implied rather than demonstrably logical.</comment>
