<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's unique role as soul-broker is intriguing, but motivations beyond song preservation remain superficial. The "grandiose modesty" voice feels stylized but lacks emotional depth or nuance in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear progression from discovery to resolution through song extraction. The reversed-label method effectively drives plot momentum. Coherence maintained despite word limit, though some transitions between cosmic concepts feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal setting and melancholic atmosphere strongly enhance tone. Vivid cosmic imagery (swirling dust, twin suns) creates immersive sensory engagement. The "recycling epochs" framework ties setting and concept together effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor and symbolism. The theme of preserving small, forgotten experiences resonates emotionally. Shows masterfully through choreographed dust motes rather than telling. Ending achieves philosophical closure with cosmic library motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept well-executed, but contains occasional overly ornate phrasing ("nascent realities," "lingering essence"). Some cosmic metaphors risk drifting into abstraction, and the tea platform's significance feels underexplored despite its anchored symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively into haunting whole. The brief format serves the ethereal concept well. Leverages mystery-of-the-moment structure effectively while planting deeper questions about memory and legacy that linger post-reading.</comment>
