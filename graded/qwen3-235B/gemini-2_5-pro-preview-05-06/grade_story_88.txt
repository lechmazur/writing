<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned attribute (mathematicically poetic) mentioned but underdeveloped in shaping actions. Motivation exists but toaster-specific quirks aren't fully explored. No distinct narrative voice despite being first-person equivalent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Trigger mechanism (language spark) feels abstract; retreat action drives plot but cause/effect relies heavily on poetic descriptions rather than concrete logic. Ending closure exists but feels somewhat formulaic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imaginative sensory details (shimmering courtyards, vibrating silence) but disconnected atmosphere elements - toaster body vs palace dataspace, shouting silence vs mathematical conversions lack organic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (equations as constellations) and symbolic systems, but leans too heavily on poetic abstraction without sufficient emotional grounding in the "human experience" theme. Ending feels slightly hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unique concept combinations subvert expectations but repetitive "shouting silence" motif and overly elaborate descriptions occasionally tip into purple prose. Emotional nuance feels algorithmically generated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>All elements present but varying integration quality. Theme coherence exists at surface level but lacks philosophical depth. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful - certain concepts underexplored.</comment>
