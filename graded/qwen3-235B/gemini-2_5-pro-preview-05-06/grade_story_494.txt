<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inconsistent development undermines the arrogant swordsman's complexity; his vulnerability feels abrupt despite superficial alignment with motivation. The tapestry reveals his burden but lacks follow-through on how his arrogance fuels the risky act.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The song-driven action cohesively bridges despair to tentative hope, but the abrupt emotional shift strains credibility within the word limit. Pacing falters slightly in the middle's internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (crunching blossoms vs. hollow-eyed villagers) masterfully reinforce the shackled potential theme. The courtyard and timeframe enhance emotional stakes through oppressive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (tapestry warming, song as "spark") elevates the emotional arc, though the ending's ambiguity lacks the thematic punch of its poignant imagery. Subtext about healing through cultural memory resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s by subverting the "hero saves town" trope, but the warrior-singing-redemption angle remains overly familiar. Some purple prose ("harsh tenderness") and logical convenience (tapestry's warming) diminish originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion despite tight constraints; each element contributes to the theme without feeling forced. The ending's open-ended hope lingers, though deeper character transformation would enhance impact.</comment>
