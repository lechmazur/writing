<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's awkwardness and hesitation are established but underexplored; motivation is clear in concept but lacks emotional depth; postcard symbolizes his ties to the past but feels more like a prop than a character-driven object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the action (emerging to bridge worlds) is resolved too abruptly, undermining the stakes; causal links between filing the scroll and the decision to act are logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative setting with vivid sensory details (sulfur, frost, coiling steam); atmosphere of desolation and latent possibility enhances the story’s melancholy; geothermal vents are both plot device and symbolic locus of dormant connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (postcard as unwritten pact, hermit crabs as ritual mediators) add depth; ending is purposeful but lacks emotional reverberation; themes of cultural erosion and restoration are implied but not fully unpacked; prose leans on imagery but occasionally slips into abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but borders on overwrought prose ("ephemeral rancor," "spectral serpents"); hermit crab ritual is inventive but risks sounding contrived; emotional states are often stated rather than contextualized; tone remains consistent but occasionally sacrifices nuance for lyrical density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly prioritized; the story leans on concept- and setting-heavy scaffolding that overshadows character interiority; the tundra orchard and postcard linger symbolically, but tighter synthesis of assigned elements could elevate the narrative.</comment>
