<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's tortured nature is stated but lacks deep exploration of inner conflict; motivations are clear but conveyed through abstract reflection rather than concrete actions; interactions with the doll hint at psychological complexity without full realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc but feels compressed; beginning/end connection is clear yet pivotal emotional beats between encounter memory and unleashing are underdeveloped; pacing balances atmospheric pauses with decisive action but lacks escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and symbolic, with circus decay mirroring character's internal state; sensory details (dust, cracked glass, faint melody) create immersive, haunting atmosphere that deepens thematic resonance; timeframe reinforces transitional moment between denial and acceptance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (stellar nurseries/cosmic voids vs. personal rebirth) elevates narrative; poetic diction occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction; ending balances ambiguity with emotional closure; tension between containment and release is both literal and existential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surreal juxtapositions (planetarium meeting occult object, cosmic imagery in circus ruin); metaphors remain fresh through unconventional pairings; some lingering risk of atmospheric abstraction over-characterization but overall maintains inventive cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration is purposeful rather than arbitrary; every assigned component shapes thematic or emotional architecture; concise format serves concentrated psychological portrait without feeling constrained; haunting ambiguity lingers beyond explicit revelations.</comment>
