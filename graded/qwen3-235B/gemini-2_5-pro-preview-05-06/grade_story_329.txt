<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character has consistent motivation (seeking hidden passages) but lacks depth; stated emotions without nuance, interactions with xenophobic community underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Predictable plot structure with weak cause-effect logic (confetti obscuring actions feels contrived); tunnel discovery feels rushed, no meaningful resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Visually detailed but emotionally sterile setting; sensory elements (damp earth, sterile hum) support mystery but lack connection to character or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Attempts thematic resonance through metaphors ("chessboard corridors") but relies on clich√©d phrases like "agonizing bliss"; ending leaves story emotionally unmoored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Routine tropes (wandering seeker, secret passage) elevated minimally; repetitive phrasing ("agonizing bliss"), underdeveloped metaphors ("sterile walkways"), plot devices feel algorithmically generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements service basic plot mechanics but lack interdependent cohesion; ending abandons narrative tension with workers, themes remain superficial.</comment>
