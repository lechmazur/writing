<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's moroseness is established but lacks depth; motivation to restore systems is underexplored emotionally. Interactions with the needle reveal little beyond surface-level curiosity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from restoration efforts to crisis and resolution, but the tight word limit creates abrupt transitions (e.g., blackout’s impact on city feels underdeveloped).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (cosmic decks, failing machinery) but atmospheric consistency falters—tone oscillates between mystical and clinical without synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of the sewing needle as a metaphor for dormant potential; ending’s thematic resonance on rediscovery is strong, but emotional payoff feels hurried.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes, but phrases like "flicker of bored excitement" lean towards cliché. Needle’s role is inventive; some descriptions (e.g., "deep thrum") verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Functional coherence under constraints, but feels reactive to word count—key moments (e.g., blackout aftermath) underexplored, weakening overall impact.</comment>
