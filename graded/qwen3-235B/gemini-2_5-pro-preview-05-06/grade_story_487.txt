<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brutus’s paradoxical blend of physicality and tranquility drives his obsession with myth-making, which is consistent but underexplored; his rejection of necromancy in favor of plant control feels abrupt without deeper internal reflection on why myth itself matters to him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between map discovery and labyrinth traversal, but the drum solos’ thematic role remains abstract; pacing manages tension well within constraints, though the resolution with the Venus flytrap leans on abrupt, unexplained baton magic that strains logical cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s humid, sentient flora and the juxtaposition of brutal violence (man-eating plants) with Brutus’s “tenderness” create visceral, contradictory atmosphere; drum solos add disorientation but lack integration into setting’s ecological logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subverts necromancy trope effectively with plant control; the closing metaphor of myth-becoming-living-life resonates. Lacks emotional depth in Brutus’s arc, leaning on surface contradictions without mining subtext about the cost of mythmaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise and twist stand out, but some descriptions (“throbbed the relentless pulse of drum solos”) verge on overwrought; avoids genre clichés except for predictable “docile brute” mystique. Subtext about controlling perception is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into Brutus’s psyche and plot mechanics, though the drum solos and map-piecing feel arbitrarily chosen. The ending’s philosophical pivot lingers but could amplify emotional weight for greater impact.</comment>
