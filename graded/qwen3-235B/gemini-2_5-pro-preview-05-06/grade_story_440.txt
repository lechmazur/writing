<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characterization is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear but thinly explored through abstract ideals rather than visceral, personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with tight pacing, though the arc feels slightly compressed; the beginning-middle-end structure is intact but resolution lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting contrasts sterile order with chaotic art effectively, but worldbuilding remains surface-level; sensory details are evocative but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (mural vs. collage, sea pottery) and subtext about control vs. chaos elevate the narrative; ending resonates as a quiet act of defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with inventive imagery; metaphors are fresh, but some abstractions ("secret weavers") verge on vague; tone remains cohesive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are well-integrated thematically, though some (e.g., "secret weavers") require narrative grounding; brevity enhances symbolic impact.</comment>
