<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Main character's aloofness is consistent but motivations remain underdeveloped; the "unstoppable curiosity" element lacks human nuance in its execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but pacing feels uneven; the "reconstruct" action is well-connected to character development, though cause-effect between the delay and discovery feels slightly contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details effectively immerse (shipping containers, fog), but some sensory elements rely on familiar maritime tropes rather than original descriptors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of uncovering truth resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by explicit thematic exposition rather than organic character-driven revelation; strong subtext potential undercut by occasional "tell-over-show."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Writing shows stylistic individuality but exhibits occasional purple prose tendencies; some metaphors ("wounded season") border on overused, and curiosity's portrayal occasionally defaults to formulaic wonder rather than psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively but lack transformative ingenuity; the story creates atmospheric cohesion without achieving the resonant, paradigm-shifting impact required by highest-tier publications.</comment>
