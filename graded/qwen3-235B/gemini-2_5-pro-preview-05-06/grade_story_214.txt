<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (siphoning radiance from doubt) is clear but underexplored; internal conflict resolved too neatly, lacking nuanced emotional progression despite connection to sea glass.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing steady despite tight word limit; beginning/end connection effective via microfilm revelation-to-acceptance arc, though some cause/effect transitions (e.g., emotional shift) feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (hum of rig, sputtering paste, warped colors) create immersive, melancholic atmosphere; connections between drowned world relics and floating observatory enhance thematic weight of loss.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (black hole, "silently audible") and subtext about cyclical creation/death elevate impact; resolution avoids clich√©, ending resonates with layered meaning through "showing" resilience via object interaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally veers into overly ornate phrasing ("brutal, beautiful cycle"); character reasoning logical but lacks human inconsistency; sensory details specific but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve theme; brief length enhances emotional restraint; lingering resonance from philosophical subtext about loss as transformative force rather than endpoint.</comment>
