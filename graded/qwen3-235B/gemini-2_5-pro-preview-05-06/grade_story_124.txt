<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's skittishness isn't consistently manifested in behavior or decisions; motivation connects to concept but lacks emotional resonance through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Progressive buildup of mental "stitching" drives plot, but limited emotional/physical consequences flatten impact; ending achieves subtle transformation within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lunar colony atmosphere is evocative through sensory contrasts (desolation/refinement), but "barbershop quietude" metaphor remains decorative rather than thematically integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some vibrant metaphors ("whisper of forgotten knowledge") counterbalance occasionally vague descriptors; unique ballet-shoe concept elevates originality despite minor poetic excesses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively in concept but unevenly in execution; the story's philosophical weight lingers more than its characters or setting.</comment>
