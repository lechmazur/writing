<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's guarded nature is implied through isolation and reluctant action, but internal conflict lacks depth; "dour amusement" informs tone but doesn't fully shape motivation or decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from gathering impulse to defiant act of humming, but the compressed word count flattens narrative arc; connection to crevasse setting is atmospheric but not structurally pivotal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glacial orchard and crevasse create an oppressive, luminous atmosphere; sensory details (cold air, glowing fruits, echoing silence) masterfully immerse reader in a fragile, dying world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elicits melancholy through ritualized defiance; metaphors of mending (safety pin, family meal) and silence as prison/comfort work well, but emotional payoff feels muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unique setting avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into overly ornate descriptions ("crystalline stillness"); subtext about clinging to memory is poignant, yet character reasoning remains under-explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meets brevity demands effectively, but conceptual layers (guardian of extinct traditions, paradox of ritual as both solace and stasis) aren't fully realized within constraints.</comment>
