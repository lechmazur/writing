<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara’s internal conflict—abandoning perfectionism—is clear, but her motivations lack psychological complexity; her "fervent indifference" feels more symbolic than humanely nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structured around cyclical observation with a quiet arc, but the plot relies on static contemplation over dynamic progression; the goose as a "method" feels metaphor-heavy without tangible stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the bellows/sand/goose triad; avoids formulaic transitions. However, phrases like "hard-won acceptance" verge on abstraction rather than lived experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a meditative whole, though the narrative’s brevity leaves some character depth unexplored. Themes linger provocatively beyond the page.</comment>
