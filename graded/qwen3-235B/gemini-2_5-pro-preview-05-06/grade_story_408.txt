<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but lacks depth in tying conscientious objector past to current obsession; motivations are clear but personal stakes remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels compressed; the storm-driven avian patterns provide cohesion, though the ending lacks a decisive resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid storm-battered orchard creates a haunting atmosphere; sensory details like howling winds and gnarled branches immerse readers, though some elements (e.g., pheromones) strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of control and subterfuge resonate; effective metaphors (e.g., orchard as complicit ally) add depth, but emotional impact is muted by overly stylized prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise and layered tone stand out; avoids clich√©s despite occasional ornate phrasing; the concept of "mapping" as covert dominion over nature feels fresh and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements, though some (e.g., holiday tradition) feel superficial; stylistic ambition sometimes overshadows clarity, but the lingering unease and ecological subtext suggest thematic depth.</comment>
