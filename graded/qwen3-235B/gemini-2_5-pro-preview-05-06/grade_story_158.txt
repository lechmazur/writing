<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinctive traits and clear motivation, but emotional depth is primarily conveyed through abstract concepts rather than organic development through actions and interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with cause-effect clarity, but the compressed resolution feels abbreviated despite the poetic language; some narrative beats could have been more fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion with ice cavern details and the candle flame metaphor creates a hauntingly vivid atmosphere that perfectly complements the existential tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poetic language and layered symbolism generate strong thematic resonance about creation/destruction cycles; emotional impact is powerful but somewhat undercut by occasionally elevated abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise with cosmic themes and lullaby analysis, but contains moments of slightly clich√©d "quantum" terminology and ornate descriptors that feel slightly artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Compelling interplay of elements creates thematic cohesion, though the final impact leans more on lyrical writing than narrative momentum; brief length both aids poetic focus and limits emotional weight.</comment>
