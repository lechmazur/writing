<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation for revenge is consistent and deeply embedded, but depth of internal conflict feels surface-level despite external actions aligning with traits. Limited emotional nuance undermines full psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression within word constraintsâ€”stagnant tension, no resolution. Clear beginning but no discernible arc; the central action (decoding genetics) remains abstract rather than driving plot forward.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (decaying velvet, must, drums) create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's obsession. Setting enhances theme but timeframe (drum circles) remains loosely integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphors ("genetic code as story") hint at deeper themes but undercut by overreliance on abstract description. Ending feels poetic but lacking narrative payoff; tension remains static.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vocabulary occasionally veers into ornate prose ("abrasive calm," "organically synthetic") without fully justifying them as organic choices. Some emotional beats are stated (e.g., "relentless resolve") rather than evoked, weakening authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel layered rather than organically unified. Story leans on atmospheric density over narrative cohesion; the brief length works for mood but weakens character and plot development. Lingering thought about "synthetic" ethics remains unexplored.</comment>
