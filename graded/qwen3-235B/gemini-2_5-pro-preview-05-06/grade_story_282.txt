<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is explicit but underexplored; Bram's traits are stated rather than organically revealed. The war medal's significance lacks emotional grounding despite its narrative importance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression relies heavily on exposition. Pacing feels compressed; climax lacks tension due to absence of obstacles. Connection between beginning/middle/end exists but feels schematic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (soot vs. dust motes) enhance mood. The "dancing dust" conceit enriches metaphorical resonance. Atmospheric consistency weakens when describing abstract timeframes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses symbolic objects effectively (medal, shell) but leans on exposition for themes. Simile/tone balance mostly strong, though "quiet triumph" conclusion feels undercomplicated. Central concept of connection is clear but could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Contains fresh combinations but relies on trope clusters (gruff artist, secret project). Some phrases risk affectation ("dusty exuberance"). Metaphors occasionally overwrite, undercutting emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesive but predictable. Elements service theme effectively while lacking narrative surprise. Brief length highlights structural efficiency over emotional layering. Prompt-compliance sacrifices some narrative depth.</comment>
