<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to channel stellar wrath is clear but lacks depth in how her “smiling saboteur” duality influences her methods; her connection to imperfection is hinted but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed; the climax’s cosmic resonance emerges abruptly without grounding in earlier actions, leaving pacing uneven within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (metallic ozone, vibrating floors) effectively evoke decay and cosmic tension; however, the gorge-suspended city’s setting doesn’t deeply shape Elara’s actions beyond ambiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (e.g., imperfection as “borrowed stellar power”) and subtextual harmony between anger/peace elevate the theme; resolution feels satisfying but underdevelops the mannequins’ symbolic role.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evasive of formulaic tropes, with fresh use of mannequins and cosmic horror; avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on abstract phrases (“burning motivation”) that border on vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under brevity; the story’s ambition to blend cosmic and personal scales is compelling, though some assigned components (e.g., “throughout studying”) feel tacked on rather than essential.</comment>
