<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's quiet introspection anchors her character, but her agency feels passive despite the emotional motivation. The purse's symbolic role in memory is effective, yet her internal conflict lacks the nuanced progression that would deepen her arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story traces a coherent emotional trajectory from longing to tentative hope, but pacing drags in mid-sections. The unresolved tension around the silent retreat and the translation center's underused potential disrupt narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (lunar roses, phantom scents) immerse effectively, but the high-concept setting of the Universal Translation Center remains superficial. The juxtaposition of advanced tech with intimate emotional struggles lacks integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical threads (constellation embroidery, translated bird songs) deepen themes of communication. The ending avoids sentimentality, offering subtle resolution. Emotional subtext is implied rather than stated, but could push further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids generic recovery tropes through specific, tactile imagery (e.g., "echo of unheard laughter"). Moments of lyrical precision counterbalance occasional abstraction. The retreat's silent communal tapestry avoids clich√© but lacks contextual surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere around memory and emotion, though the translation center feels more like backdrop than active force. The tight structure uses brevity purposefully, leaving resonance in the contrast between technological precision and human imprecision.</comment>
