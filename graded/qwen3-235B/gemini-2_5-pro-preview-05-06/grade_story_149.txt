<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (unity quest) but lacks nuanced reactions to ostracism; the prophet designation feels more symbolic than integrated into psychological depth or growth trajectory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Circular structure prioritizes atmosphere over narrative progression; inciting incident and current dilemma are linked but lack evolving stakes or concrete consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liminal laundromat/study settings use rich sensory dissonance (bleach vs ancient air), but the giant's study remains more metaphor than functional narrative space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (fractured futures, forgotten dreams) elevate concept, but emotional impact diluted by passive voice; themes resonate though plot doesn't fully dramatize them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally indulges in ornate abstractions ("haunting delight") that prioritize style over human authenticity in character decisions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Polished prose with conceptual elegance but lacks urgent emotional core; elements serve theme more than forming a cohesive narrative engine within limited word count.</comment>
