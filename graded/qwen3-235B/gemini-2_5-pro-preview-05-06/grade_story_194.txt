<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character transitions from naive curiosity to grim resolve are clear but could use more internal conflict exploration; motivations evolve logically but lack nuanced emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Well-paced escalation from discovery to existential stakes within word limits; resolution feels slightly truncated but maintains narrative continuity through symbolic object integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of bone-white walls, clattering china, and whispering woods creates immersive atmosphere that mirrors protagonist's psychological state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elicits visceral unease through ancestral memory symbolism; subtext about cyclical history emerges organically, though emotional depth occasionally relies on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic traps with fresh ossuary-restaurant juxtaposition but exhibits occasional overwrought description; some emotional beats verge on explicit rather than shown through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unusual premise executed with thematic cohesion; condensed format enhances tension rather than limiting scope, leaving provocative questions about time/agency that linger post-reading.</comment>
