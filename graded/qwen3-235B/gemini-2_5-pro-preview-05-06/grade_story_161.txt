<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's vigilance and trauma from the orchard's blight shape her suspicion of conspiracy, but her transition to theatrical dissent feels underexplored. The seal discovery reinforces her paranoia but lacks emotional depth in connecting her past and present selves. Her "sardonic glee" in the climax adds complexity but isn't fully rooted in prior characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on eerie parallel patterns between blight and flight failures, but the word limit strains the causal logic. The archival seal's revelation is abrupt, and the community feedback session climax feels rushed. While the beginning-to-end linkage (order vs. chaos) is thematically clear, the compressed narrative undermines stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The paper airplane facility's whimsy contrasts effectively with its alleged corruption, but sensory details are sparse—dust, cold metal, distant hum. The seal's predatory bird insignia subtly echoes the "gardener" motif, yet the setting's potential as a metaphorical "orchard" isn't fully exploited. Atmosphere leans more on concept than immersive description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s paper-peacock mosaic is a striking visual metaphor, and the alignment of blight/failure patterns cleverly dramatizes systemic sabotage. The ending lands emotionally with grim satisfaction but risks didacticism. Subtext about control vs. organic growth resonates, though the "malice-as-blight" theme could be more subtly teased.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids AI tropes: the paper airplane facility feels inventive, not gimmicky. The predatory bird seal avoids cliché by linking to both orchard and flight motifs. Character reasoning blends logic (pattern analysis) and intuition (shivers of recognition). No purple prose; language is restrained but resonant. The tragedy-to-protest arc feels authentic, not algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven—orchardist past, volunteering routine, seal clue—but thematic cohesion (pruning potential) slightly outweighs emotional engagement. The brevity forces sketchiness in character history and conspiracy mechanics, yet the peacock mosaic’s poetic impact lingers as a conceptual triumph.</comment>
