<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth despite clear motivation. The monk's obsession with vengeance lacks nuanced development beyond surface traits, making his stubbornness feel archetypal rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tension between past and present drives the plot, but the abrupt revelation about tooth marks feels rushed. The arc from dream to discovery has coherence but insufficient buildup within the word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative snow-dusted mountains and fragile warmth contrast effectively. However, atmospheric details remain superficial—sensory elements hint at tension but don't fully immerse or deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors about stolen reflection offer conceptual depth. The twist reclaiming corrupted past is notable, but the ending lacks emotional payoff—aesthetic craft is strong, but intellectual engagement outweighs visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While avoiding pure formulaic writing, the tooth-mark cipher device borders on contrived originality. The reflection motif is refreshed through historical theft theme, but some phrasing ("fragile bubble of warmth") veers toward mannered prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but never transcend setup for a larger narrative. The brevity works as cryptic vignette rather than standalone achievement—lingering questions about past abuse of disciplines feel underdeveloped.</comment>
