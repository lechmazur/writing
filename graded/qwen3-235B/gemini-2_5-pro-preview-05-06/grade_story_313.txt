<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but surface-level; motivations feel consistent but lack deeper psychological complexity that would elevate Silas beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective circular structure with beginning/middle/end compression; pacing is tight but loses some subtlety in mid-story transitions between internal monologue and external action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric textures in protein synthesizers and nutrient-depleted imagery, but the psychic residue of broken farmhands could have more visceral sensory grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphorical objects (tape dispenser as cyclic failure/regrowth) effectively; ending's satisfyingness depends on prior acceptance of anticlimactic resistance as thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some overworked phrases ("taunt the jaws of defeat") border on clich√©, but the mundane hauntings subvert dystopian tropes with originality; emotional landscape feels honestly nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Brightest in its synthesis of disparate elements; weaker in emotional resonance that would transform concept execution into transcendence; works competently at its ambition level.</comment>
