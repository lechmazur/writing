<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (revealing silenced truth) is clear, but internal conflict lacks nuanced exploration. The metaphor of "earthbound flight" offers a distinct voice but insufficient emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc with logical cause-effect, but pacing feels slightly rushed. The method lacks sufficient technical explanation, slightly weakening coherence within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sterile setting of the capsule hotel creates a clinical tone, but underdeveloped sensory details and weak integration with the character's emotional state reduce immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story evokes themes of censorship and rebellion. Poetic phrases like "earthbound flight" add literary value, but emotional resonance is diluted by surface-level showing/telling balance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise weakened by formulaic dystopian tropes. Avoids purple prose but lacks subversive twists. Metaphors (echoed voice as rebellion) feel familiar rather than innovative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels mechanically assembled. Elements serve plot functionally but aren't organically interwoven. Leaves thematic questions but lacks layered complexity for high-tier impact.</comment>
