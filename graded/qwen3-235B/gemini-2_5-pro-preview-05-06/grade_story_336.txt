<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (hope against darkness) is clear but lacks psychological depth; "placid ferocity" feels abstract rather than embodied in concrete behaviors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Focused ritual action creates cohesion, but the abbreviated arc undermines emotional payoff; precise mechanics of sun-path imprisonment strain credibility despite tribal knowledge framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through contrast between opulent decay and cold modernity; sensory details (cold air, clock's clicks) create visceral immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective metaphoric interplay of light/dark and memory/reality; ending avoids pat resolution but risks thematic vagueness through lack of human consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric originality but relies on familiar "magic against darkness" trope; some phrases ("ember in the void") dip into clich√© despite precise imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work in concert rather than feeling imposed; ritual's temporal limitation feels organic to theme; prose elevates concept but occasionally obscures emotional immediacy.</comment>
