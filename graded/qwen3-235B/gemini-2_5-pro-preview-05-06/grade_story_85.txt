<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (seeking wisdom) is clear and consistent, but lacks interiority and growth beyond initial premise; actions align with assigned "subtle" trait but remain surface-level without nuanced exploration of how this subtlety shapes their worldview.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from entering forest to revelation to resolution; cause-effect of pattern recognition to world-altering insight holds internally. Pacing slightly rushed in middle but maintains coherence; fleeting moment (7H) effectively structures climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Petrified forest (7G) rendered with visceral, original sensory details (e.g., "sky the color of old parchment") that mirror character's quest for wisdom; atmosphere perfectly amplifies the theme of cyclical creation/destruction within the "stone trees."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elicits tension through paradoxical beauty/horror of cosmic truths; ending avoids easy resolution while reinforcing central theme. Strong use of metaphor (e.g., forging as "birth of stars") but slightly undermined by self-consciously "poetic" phrasing in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s, but contains occasional overwrought descriptors ("lucidly confusing," "terrifying elegance") and a somewhat predictable arc (solitary seeker finds transformative truth in desolate place). Subtlety and silence motifs add freshness but not revolutionary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively to explore wisdom-as-process; brevity amplifies thematic focus more than narrative depth. Lingering question remains about the cost of withheld knowledge, though character's flat affect slightly weakens emotional resonance.</comment>
