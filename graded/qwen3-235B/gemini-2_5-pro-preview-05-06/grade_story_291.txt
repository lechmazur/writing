<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits (daring, defiance) are clear but under-explored emotionally; motivation to confront prejudice ties logically to actions, but inner complexity remains superficial despite symbolic gestures like the rope.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot progresses through direct action (navigating maze) with a clear beginning/middle/resolution, but pacing falters—resolution via the hidden speaker feels rushed, lacking organic tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (whispers, warped reflections) create immersion, but connections between the dying tree/orchard cat and thematic elements feel decorative rather than integral to the prejudice metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (maze as societal judgment; rope as resilience) elevates the narrative, but emotional depth is undercut by occasionally generic conflict framing and predictable thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids full trope reliance by reframing "haunting" as deliberate machinery, though cosmic echoes and prison backstory flirt with cliché. Prose balances clarity with purposeful metaphor without overindulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively linked but serve plot mechanics over organic storytelling; the ending satisfies thematically yet lacks lingering resonance due to underdeveloped emotional stakes in Eva’s journey.</comment>
