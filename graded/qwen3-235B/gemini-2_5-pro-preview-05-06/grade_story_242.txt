<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but Elias remains enigmatic rather than fully developed; his "mirthful solemnity" creates tension but isn't deeply explored beyond surface contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but resolution feels abrupt; the central action of tailing strangers drives the narrative but connections between surveillance and final revelation require elaboration for full cohesiveness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (dust, herbs, old paper) create an immersive, elegiac atmosphere; setting's nostalgia theme resonates with characters' yearning but faction worldbuilding lacks depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Herbs as cultural relic and steam-as-symbol offer resonance; ending achieves thematic closure but emotional impact is diluted by overly expository dialogue in the pivotal exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique setting mashup (retro phone booth meets post-truth dystopia); character psychology feels nuanced though occasional descriptive density risks purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but brevity forces schematic storytelling; premise lingers intellectually through themes of mediated connection rather than emotional resonance.</comment>
