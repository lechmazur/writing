<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation feels underexplored despite clear setup; internal conflicts or growth remain surface-level, though actions align with stated traits like curiosity and reverence for family history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and a clear arc within word limits, but some transitions (e.g., sudden resonance effect) feel rushed, slightly undermining cause-effect logic despite creative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details and atmospheric tension between decay and cosmic intimacy are masterful, though deeper thematic ties between setting and character’s obsession could enhance cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegantly evokes melancholy and wonder, but relies on poetic abstraction over concrete showing in emotional beats; metaphors are fresh yet occasionally diluted by over-reliance on lyrical vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers toward ornate phrasing ("spectral hand," "cosmic intimacy") that feels generically mystical rather than uniquely grounded; tonal consistency falters during abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven but rarely transcend their assigned roles to create narrative synergy; style leans heavily on atmosphere over structural innovation, leaving conceptual potential underexploited.</comment>
