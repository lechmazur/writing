<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s rebellion and preservationist motivation are clear and consistent with her actions, but her internal voice lacks distinctiveness beyond archetypal “rebel” traits. Her theoretical insights into the passage lean on exposition rather than organic character-driven deduction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot’s constrained structure works efficiently: the torn note’s clue drives the journey, the shifting passage creates tension, and the revelation of scrolls provides payoff. Pacing falters slightly during abstract descriptions of “braided bitterness,” but the storm-frame bookends the story cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral: the damp, sentient walls and lime-mortar scent immerse readers. The “breathing” corridor and shadows amplify dread. The timeframe between storms sharpens urgency, though the haunted setting’s thematic link to “preservation” could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (“braided bitterness,” “stone walls subtly shifting”) deepen emotional resonance. The central theme of tradition vs. modernism is elegantly woven, and the ending’s quiet triumph avoids melodrama. However, subtext on fear-as-guardian is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity: the sentient architecture “haunting” subverts genre clichés. Some phrases (“whispered tales,” “clutching scrolls”) veer toward romanticized tropes. Emotional depth is shown through sensory details rather than blunt telling, but the Guild’s “sterile modernism” is thinly antagonized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements cohesively, though the “shared secrets” method feels tacked-on. The short form enhances tension without sacrificing resolution, and the final image of Elara facing a storm with scrolls lingers thematically.</comment>
