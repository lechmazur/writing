<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits (solemn, mild fervor) are superficially established but lack psychological depth; motivation ties to plot but isn't rooted in human complexity; box interaction shows determination but no emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through poetry-driven investigation but feels compressed; the arc builds logically toward localization decision, but lacks payoff; poetic method shapes plot but pacing feels truncated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic atmosphere achieved through precise sensory details (scent of rust, sound of howling wind); setting directly enhances desperation and fleeting legacy; tone contrasts solemnity with subtle beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates scientific inquiry into poetic metaphor; central conflict of survival vs impermanence resonates through subtext; final image of footprints vs enduring knowledge provides satisfying thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (botanical evolution with mystical poet-magician), but swordsman trope remains generic; poetic cartography avoids clich√©s but occasionally dips into ornate description that feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively but not innovatively; short form serves urgency but limits character depth; lingering questions about worldbuilding exceed narrative's scope without feeling intentional.</comment>
