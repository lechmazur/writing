<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict with predecessors is hinted but lacks external manifestation; motive to "out-face old ghosts" remains abstract without emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shadow-corroboration action drives the plot but relies on convoluted exposition; pacing is tense yet resolution feels abrupt due to compressed word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (metallic ozone, yew shadows) create immersive atmosphere; setting's duality (touristy well vs. secret route) enhances thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; brevity sacrifices narrative depth but preserves structural coherence.</comment>
