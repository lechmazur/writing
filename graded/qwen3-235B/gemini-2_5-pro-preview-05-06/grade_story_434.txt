<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond archetypal traits; motivation drives action but lacks psychological complexity. Voice remains consistent but stylized rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent structure within tight constraints, though the zero-gravity ritual feels slightly rushed. Plot progression is logical but lacks layered stakes or escalating tension despite clear beginning/middle/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive atmosphere with rich sensory details (soundproofing, ozone scent) and a strong sense of isolation. The ghost story booth setting meaningfully supports both tone and artifact-guarding premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphorical imagery ("symphony of protection") and thematic cohesion around legacy vs. encroachment. Ending resonates with melancholy theatricality, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality wavers between fresh concepts (zero-g flame ritual) and familiar tropes (cursed artifacts). Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on atmospheric shorthand rather than nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively, though the narrative’s brevity prioritizes mood over lasting thematic weight. The self-contained nature of the artifact defense feels polished but doesn’t fully transcend its genre roots.</comment>
