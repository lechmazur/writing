<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but underexplored; actions align with traits but reveal little psychological complexity. Assigned object (bucket) connects to character's scavenging habit but lacks symbolic resonance. Voice remains clinical despite first-person implications.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>PLOT: Action drives progression but compressed arc feels abrupt; connection between beginning/end exists yet underdeveloped. Cause/effect logical but under-explained. Pacing prioritizes information over emotional weight; temporal transitions occasionally jarring within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>WORLD: Kaleidoscopic coral creates vivid atmosphere; temporal motif ("quiet after train whistle") enhances isolation. Sensory details strong but inconsistently integrated (e.g., algae's bioluminescence should permeate more scenes). Object/setting connection exists but could be thematically richer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>IMPACT: Effective use of "devouring taboo" metaphor and disease-as-misunderstanding theme. Ending's thematic pay-off works conceptually but emotionally muted. Shows more than tells but with uneven emotional calibration; central conflict resolved too conveniently for full dramatic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>ORIGINALITY: Avoids major tropes but contains polished-copper descriptions bordering on purple prose. Motel scavenging and bucket choice show creativity; some phrasing ("leviathan suffering," "fabric of fear") risks pretension. Emotional beats mostly shown but occasionally flattened by technical vocabulary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>GENERAL: Elements serve narrative cohesively but not transcendentally; brevity aids tension but limits character/relationship depth. Thematic unity present but execution occasionally prioritizes concepts over lived experience. Leaves questions about societal structures, which is effective.</comment>
