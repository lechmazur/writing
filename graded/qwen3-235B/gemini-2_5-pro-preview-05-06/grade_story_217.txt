<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara’s "quiet defiance" is referenced but not deeply woven into her actions; motivation to "prime wonder" drives plot but her rebelliousness lacks tangible expression. Dialogue and internal monologue don’t distinctively differentiate her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Summoning call propels the plot effectively, but the haunted house exploration feels streamlined; the resolution (leaving the journal) ties back to the premise, though Antoine’s backstory is cursorily sketched. Pacing is uneven in spots.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Haunting decay and sensory details (burnt sugar, creaking structures) vividly immerse the reader. The atmosphere amplifies Elara’s emotional stagnation and the chef’s isolation, though "ephemeral gloom" slightly overstates the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional depth from subtextual loss and the chili carving’s symbolism resonate. Literary devices (e.g., "gaping maw") enhance mood, but explanatory ending slightly dilutes subtlety. The theme of adaptation is implicit, not fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (e.g., focusing on lost love instead of a ghost), but leans on familiar haunted park tropes. Language is occasionally overwritten ("bruised twilight") and lacks idiosyncratic voice. The twist feels modestly innovative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, though some strain (e.g., the pocket knife’s role feels contrived). The brevity works for the premise but limits character depth. Ending gestures at thematic resonance but leaves some threads unresolved.</comment>
