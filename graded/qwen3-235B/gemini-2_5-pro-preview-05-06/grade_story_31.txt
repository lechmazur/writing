<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strong motivation (connection) drives actions, but character remains a melancholic stereotype; emotional depth lacks nuance beyond surface traits like "solemn" orchardist.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear arc from contemplation to symbolic planting, but the rushed middle section undermines emotional stakes; the key and beacon drive limited cause-effect logic within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cyberpunk/garden juxtaposition is vivid, but sensory details lean on familiar contrasts (neon vs. glow); atmosphere lacks specific textures to make the world breathe beyond genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mycelial metaphor and data-driven bloom evoke theme; ending avoids sentimentality. Emotional resonance is muted by lack of concrete reactions from either character, relying heavily on implication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some generic descriptors ("splash of life") undercut originality, but the beacon concept subverts AI tropes. Subtext about silent connection is fresh, though "overlooked child" leans on well-worn archetypes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrative coherence is strong, but themes lack urgency; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful. Conceptual integration is tight, yet emotional payoff remains thin.</comment>
