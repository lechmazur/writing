<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation drives Alistair’s rebellion, but his internal conflict remains underdeveloped. The rosebud’s symbolism reinforces his goals, yet the character lacks psychological nuance, reducing him to a near-allegorical figure rather than a fully realized individual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The echo test drives immediate action, but the truncated plot feels like an excerpt rather than a self-contained narrative. The connection between abandoned mansion and library is logical, yet the word limit prevents meaningful escalation or resolution of stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich decay—corroded pipes, storm-lashed cliffs—creates a haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like the vibrating rosebud and sonorous hum immerse readers, though the “hidden worlds” concept remains abstract rather than viscerally experienced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., library as a “lung”) offer thematic depth, and the clash between cold logic and empathy resonates. Emotional payoff is limited by narrative brevity, but the subtext of reclamation vs. control lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrases like “colliding destinies” flirt with cliché, while passages about “organic sympathy” risk pretension. The rosebud’s symbolism and “fantasy practicality” twist elevate originality, but inconsistent tonal restraint and occasionally overwrought phrasing undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s ambition outpaces its execution in the tight format. Assigned elements are tightly woven into the setting and theme, though the lack of narrative payoff and reliance on exposition leave a sense of incompleteness despite evocative imagery.</comment>
