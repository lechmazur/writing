<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has surface-level contradictions (messy/poetic, violent/passive) but lacks depth in emotional reasoning. Motivation shift from destruction to non-violence feels abrupt, relying on vague "whispers" rather than inner logic. Voice lacks distinctive rhythm despite being a poet-narrator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear arc from toxic behavior to enlightenment works, but compressed resolution feels unearned. Cause/effect between botanical samples and ideology shift needs more concrete progression. Pacing stumbles slightly between atmospheric descriptions and plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Haunting as "echo of past conflicts" offers interesting texture but atmospheric details (dust, subway sounds) remain generic. Sensory language is present but unevenly applied - more olfactory/tactile elements needed to ground the "empty abundance" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses botanical metaphor effectively for theme, but emotional impact diluted by heavy exposition. Subtext about cultivating peace through environmental change is clever, though ending feels more like summary than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh angles (botanical samples as non-violence symbols) and tropes ("haunted attic wisdom," poet-insomniac shorthand). Some purple prose ("garden of potential") and predictable contrasts between drunkenness/sober conversations undercut originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements勉强cohere conceptually but strain under word limit. Botanical samples and whispers drive theme effectively, while drunken confessions subplot feels hastily discarded. Theme lingers, but technical polish missing for "flawless" publishability.</comment>
