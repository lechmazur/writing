<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's dry wit and reckless precision are present but thinly developed; motivation to archive spectral methods feels secondary to plot mechanics rather than deeply intrinsic to his identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on dance-as-method framework, which stretches logic despite poetic resonance; transitions between backstory and present action require more narrative scaffolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse bedroom evokes rich atmosphere through precise details (dust motes, concertina melody) but could deepen temporal specificity tied to "just after" timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional impact derives from metaphorical intersections (dance as memory conduit, rope as broken vow); some thematic residue about preservation vs. release lingers, though subtext remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by reframing haunt conventions through archival impulse and ritualized dance; sensory details (battered concertina, coarse rope) prioritize specificity over generic eeriness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story demonstrates strong craft in mood and concept integration but lacks narrative urgency or thematic heft required for elite literary distinction.</comment>
