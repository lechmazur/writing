<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks depth; numb fascination and ethical ambiguity are stated but not fully embodied in actions or internal conflicts. Cold curiosity feels surface-level without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence stumbles in the word limit—resolution feels abrupt despite clear progression. The connection between knitting codes and cosmic interference is conceptually intriguing but lacks visceral cause-effect development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (cigar scent, clinking needles) and jazz age preservation create a vividly immersive, contrasting atmosphere. The tension between mundane actions and cosmic stakes is atmospherically strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery (shimmering mug, unraveling research) elevates the story, but deeper themes of obsession vs. ethics remain underexplored. The ending lacks emotional resonance, leaning on vague numbness over specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate descriptions ("veil of ordinary perception"). The knitting-codes method is inventive, though cosmic wonder trope could feel fresher. Emotional subtext leans on detached observation rather than organic nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive but compressed; jazz age framing and cosmic methods clash in tone briefly. The brevity sacrifices lingering impact, but the juxtaposition of mundane tools with sublime ambition is thought-provoking within constraints.</comment>
