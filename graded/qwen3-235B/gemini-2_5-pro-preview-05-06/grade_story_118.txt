<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a conceptual device. Motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict; reactions to objects feel dictated by plot needs rather than organic personality. No distinct narrative voice emerges despite collective consciousness premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression but lacks narrative tension. Method drives plot but becomes repetitive. Beginning and end connect thematically but lack emotional payoff. Pacing maintains forward motion but feels mechanically constrained by word limit rather than purposefully condensed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting establishes mood expertly through sensory language - dense atmosphere, hissing wax, textured obsidian. The secret agent facility's sterile expectations contrast with ritualistic candle process. Atmosphere enhances concept but mechanical references (regret-data patterns) undercut emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors transform bureaucratic horror into visceral poetry. Wax patterns as codified failure demonstrate striking symbolism. Ending's resigned observation carries thematic resonance. "Enlightened necromancy" encapsulates haunting ethical ambiguity that lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some overwrought descriptions ("synthesized consciousness symphony") border on purple prose. Sensory details effective but unevenly distributed. Emotional states implied through environmental cues rather than stated, though collective voice occasionally defaults to conceptual abstractions rather than human responses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Leverages all elements cohesively but prioritizes concept over emotional impact. Artificial constraints feel purposefully employed as narrative framework. Leaves lingering questions about institutional morality rather than neat closure. Stylistic sophistication elevates above formulaic structures.</comment>
