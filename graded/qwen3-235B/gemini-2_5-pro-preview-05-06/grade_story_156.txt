<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Thorne's confusion is established but motivation for 'understanding evolutionary wisdom' feels abstract. His 'boldly timid' attribute is stated more than demonstrated through actionable behavior. Interactions with the key and villagers reveal surface-level contradictions but lack psychological depth. The dialogue with Elara lacks distinct voice, reading more like philosophical exposition than organic exchange.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc (naïve outsider → modest revelation) is clear but feels rushed within the word limit. The catalyst (bus observation → Elara's wisdom) occurs abruptly, lacking emotional buildup. Cause-effect between Thorne's liberalization goal and bird symbolism is implied but underdeveloped. Pacing stumbles in balancing worldbuilding (village customs) with character introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subterranean village succeeds through sensory details (saline tunnels, humming quiet, bioluminescent swallows) that enhance mood. Bus journeys create effective liminal spaces for reflection. Atmospheric tension between 'eerie' isolation and villagers' 'joyfully tragic' philosophy is vividly rendered. However, the spare key's connection to the salt mine setting feels inconsistently materialized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery of synchronized swallows as evolutionary wisdom metaphor works conceptually but lacks emotional urgency. Elara's dialogue contains resonant phrases ('deep rightness of belonging') that feel slightly didactic. The ending's revelation about respecting existing systems avoids easy answers but could benefit from more visceral showing rather than abstract telling. Lingering question about Western interventionist hubris remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt AI tics but occasionally defaults to ornate description ('roadmap of wrinkles') over psychological nuance. Some metaphors ('evolutionary wisdom') feel intellectually fashionable rather than freshly envisioned. While avoiding most tropes, the 'enlightened native' trope emerges faintly in Elara's wisdom. Emotional register remains contemplative without visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements but unevenly – the salt mine setting and bird observation method create cohesion, while 'boldly timid' and 'joyfully tragic' labels sometimes overshadow organic characterization. The brief format feels limiting rather than purposeful; deeper exploration of the counterpoint philosophy is needed. The key and evolutionary wisdom concepts suggest potential for layered meaning that remains partially realized.</comment>
