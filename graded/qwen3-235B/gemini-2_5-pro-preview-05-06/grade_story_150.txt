<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's outlaw/poet duality shapes actions well, but lacks depth beyond initial traits. Motivation of curiosity is clear but under-developed through transformative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression from observation to critical choice works within constraints, though climax feels abrupt. Plot coherence maintained but resolution lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Steampunk dome's sensory immersion (metallic textures, ticking rhythms) and dynamic text walls create evocative contrasts. Atmospheric fusion of mechanical and existential themes masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (dice vs. mechanized fate) create layered meaning. Lingering question about agency in a predetermined cosmos provokes thought. Subtle tension between free will and structure powerfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through paradoxical cowboy-poet-philosopher hybrid. Some ornate phrases ("symphony of steam"), but unique imagery like sentient brass walls offsets potential formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but don't transcend expectations. The constrained format works as intentional vignette but lacks emotional resonance beyond atmospheric tension.</comment>
