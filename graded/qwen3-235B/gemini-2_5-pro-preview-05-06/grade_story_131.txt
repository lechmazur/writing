<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness as a defense mechanism is established but lacks deeper psychological exploration; her motivation to transform fear into courage is clear but inconsistently manifested in actions beyond the central task.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by gravitational anomaly and cryptic message is logical but unevenly paced; the resolution feels abrupt despite narrative coherence, relying on convenient symbolic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through counterintuitive gravity effects and tactile details (e.g., vibrating stones), though the emotional weight of the orphan's backstory remains underdeveloped in the setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively structured around a single transformative moment; writing demonstrates disciplined control over tone and symbolism within constraints, though deeper character exploration is sacrificed.</comment>
