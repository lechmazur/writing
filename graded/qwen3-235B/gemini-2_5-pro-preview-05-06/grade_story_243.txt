<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character suffers from underdeveloped motivations beyond surface-level curiosity; nervousness feels imposed rather than organically tied to deeper psychological stakes. The necromancer trait remains superficial, unconnected to broader existential themes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains momentum through mystery-driven progression, but rushed resolution lacks emotional payoff. Cause-effect between mural analysis and revelation feels logical but execution lacks depth to fully satisfy the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere shines through vivid digital decay imagery ("error message waterfall") and coded color symbolism. Retro game world integrates effectively with both tone and thematics of corruption, though physical sensations remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional subtext through metaphor (paint drips as data corruption), layered with philosophical inquiry about power structures. The ending's ambiguity creates lingering tension rather than frustration despite brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most genre traps through digital/necromantic fusion concept, but strains at edges (echoing footsteps as beta glitch feels like pseudo-explanation). Some overwritten phrasing ("spectral sounds...core concept") detracts from otherwise original vision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically rich whole greater than its parts, yet word constraints expose superficial treatment of several components (sleeping old gods, fishhook's mechanics). Lingering conceptual ambition justifies format.</comment>
