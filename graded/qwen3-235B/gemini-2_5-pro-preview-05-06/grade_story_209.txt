<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's profession as woodsman is underdeveloped, but emotional core of grief and realization through object (hairbrush) creates significant depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed but coherent; device malfunction as pivotal moment feels slightly rushed despite strong thematic connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, unsettling atmosphere through specific sensory details ("ozone," "skeletal antennas") that mirror character's emotional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Moderate emotional resonance through metaphorical failures (device/personality), but psychological revelations stay surface-level rather than layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original conceptualization (mapping echoes as emotional mapping) with minimal formulaic writing; however, some overly elaborate descriptions border on purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrated; constrained length works thematically but sacrifices some nuance. Ending offers closure without cheap sentimentality.</comment>
