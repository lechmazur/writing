<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Finch's quirks (mad botanist, carnivorous plant) define his actions, but motivations lack psychological complexity; obsession explained superficially through dialogue, not layered characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ionization attempt drives plot but lacks escalation; sudden failure feels abrupt. Framing within intermission creates tension, yet circular structure (no resolution) undermines coherence in brief narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tea house's sensory details (ozone, flickering film) evoke atmosphere; high-altitude setting enhances mystique. Contrast between tweed formality and mountain austerity works, but cultural specifics remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vibrant metaphors ("mist-enshrouded resolve") and ironic tone ("loyalty as fickle as mountain weather") elevate craft. Subtext about humanity's futile control over nature resonates, though emotional impact limited by satire's dominance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through eccentric combinations (botanist-spliced film science) but relies on "mad scientist" archetype. Language occasionally veers into self-parody; purple prose minimized but feels consciously stylized rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements (belt, film method) tightly integrated into comedic-mystical tone. Brief span highlights eccentric premise but lacks thematic closure. Provokes curiosity about Finch's future failures rather than delivering resonant finality.</comment>
