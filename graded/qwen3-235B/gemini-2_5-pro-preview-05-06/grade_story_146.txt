<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The character exhibits clear internal conflict (faux fortune teller vs. real visions), but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient emotional layering. The "peaceful anger" attribute lacks contextual integration, and voice remains inconsistently distinct despite intriguing conceptual seeds.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from vision to revelation, but pacing feels uneven - the crypt discovery needs slower buildup, while the ending resolution rushes the implications of sacred development. Cause/effect logic holds, but the thematic weight feels underdeveloped for the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sets a vivid atmosphere with sensory details (hum felt in bones, dry earth scent), but the archive's connection to planting season remains abstract rather than organically felt. Environment shapes action but lacks immersive specificity about the "extinct language" element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism through the bone flute's cyclical growth/decay imagery. Ending provides thematic resonance, but emotional impact remains muted due to limited character interiority. Literary devices enhance rather than overwhelm, with clear theme development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with "peaceful anger" and linguistic archive elements, but follows a somewhat predictable mystical artifact quest structure. Some phrases ("ancient stone") verge on clich√©, while character reasoning occasionally feels overly logical rather than viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements into a cohesive whole, though several fit awkwardly (attribute "regularly seldom"). Stylistic choices serve clarity more than heightened impact. The brief format feels constrained rather than deliberate, with lingering potential unexplored.</comment>
