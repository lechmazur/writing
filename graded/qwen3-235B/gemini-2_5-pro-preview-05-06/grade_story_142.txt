<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (legacy restoration) and financial desperation, but lacks emotional depth; actions are consistent but personality remains largely undefined beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc with logical cause-effect, but pacing feels compressed; the word limit strains gradual revelation of the seed/locket solution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive, with decay and spectral contrasts vividly rendered through sensory details; setting deeply informs the thematic tension between past and present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through harmonizing theme and symbolism (seed as renewal); writing style blends poetic precision with narrative momentum, though some metaphors verge on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with unique interplay of science (botanical illustration) and supernatural, but contains occasional overly ornate phrasing; character psychology remains understated yet plausible.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All assigned elements are tightly woven into the narrative; achieves thematic cohesion and leaves lingering reflection on legacy-as-cultivation, though constrained by brevity.</comment>
