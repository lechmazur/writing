<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's cheerless demeanor and fatal flaw are well-integrated, but emotional complexity could be deeper; motivation drives the plot but transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear cause-effect, but the leap from experimental error to temporal elasticity feels underdeveloped; pacing remains effective despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (humming servers, decaying chest) masterfully create atmosphere; setting deeply supports thematic and character elements with only minor underexplored potential.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of alchemy and sci-fi avoids clich√©s; language is vivid without excess, though slight overreliance on "hum" motif edges toward formulaic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of assigned elements; brevity enhances thematic impact through focused emotional arc; leaves lingering questions about self-redemption.</comment>
