<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (truth against lies) is clear, but psychological depth undermined by occasional summary over lived experience; stage fright manifests physically but not fully cognitively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compact yet complete arc; key-turn action tightens tension logically; inheritance concept threads through plot organically despite brevity; pacing balances introspection and forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting fused meticulously with thematic concerns; sensory details (cold vacuum vs pressed flowers) create tangible juxtaposition; "defiant hush" tone permeates environmental and psychic spaces alike.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (crushed daisy/fragile astronaut) resonate beyond plot; layers of inheritance/submersion form philosophical subtext; emotional impact emerges through symbolic action rather than declarative statements.</comment>
