<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (restoring kingdom) is clear but underexplored; peaceful anger is stated rather than embodied; "amiable gambler" facade lacks depth beyond surface juxtaposition; reactions to ledger remain intellectualized rather than visceral</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves micro-arc through ledger-gala connection, but hydrolyze revelation feels abrupt; pacing manages density without feeling rushed; beginning/end linkage exists but lacks payoff magnitude; cause-effect logic holds for artifact theory but emotional stakes remain abstract</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Firefly imagery creates atmospheric potential but remains underutilized; charity drives functionally integrate but lack period/cultural specificity; setting contrasts (urban gala vs. natural reeds) are minimally developed; sensory details feel selectively applied rather than immersive</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness in unbecoming/image dissolution concept persists; ending leaves thematic tension unresolved; conflict remains intellectualized rather than viscerally engaging; writing style shows control but over-replies on abstract diction ("peaceful anger," "quiet inferno"); subtext about truth-reconstruction is present but lightly handled</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but contains AI-like phrase clusters ("ethereal beauty," "faint glimmers of hope"); emotional contours feel calculated rather than organic; some mechanical connections (fireflies=hope, petals=dismantling) lean on conventional symbolism; prose occasionally becomes ornate without purpose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements technically cohere but often operate in parallel rather than organically interacting; abstract concepts outpace narrative embodiment; brevity serves thematic compression but hinders emotional investment; leaves intellectual impressions more than visceral impact</comment>
