<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (mastery of strategy) is clear and logically tied to his behavior, but lacks psychological depth; "sweetly confrontational" tone in dialogue is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Minimalist plot structure functions within word constraints; the hiker's entrance creates narrative momentum but resolution feels abrupt and thematically underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quasar deck's juxtaposition with bees creates strong symbolic atmosphere; sensory details (wax/kettle sounds, cold air) effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Philosophical themes and cosmic/natural metaphors elevate, but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral; ending lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids most clich√©s but occasionally veers toward romanticized solitude tropes; some overwrought phrases ("ephemeral blueprints") dilute authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively to explore interconnectedness; poetic brevity works to advantage; secondary character introduction lacks narrative payoff.</comment>
