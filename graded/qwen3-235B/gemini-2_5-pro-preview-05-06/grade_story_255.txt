<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Promises depth through unique motivation but fails to fully humanize the seer; motivations are clear but lack emotional resonance or complexity beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structural coherence exists within strict limits, but the transition from decryption to resolution feels abrupt; lacks gradual escalation despite conceptually strong arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lush, immersive atmosphere with tactile sensory details; setting and scent method create tangible tension; metaphors like "vacant eyes" and petrichor elevate mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid poetic imagery (e.g., "digital ghost") and thematic undercurrents about truth vs. noise are compelling, but emotional impact is muted by clinical detachment in execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with scent-based decryption but occasionally slips into overly ornate phrasing ("parched landscapes of the world"); mostly maintains authentic emotional subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel calculated rather than organic; short form enhances poetic density while constraining emotional payoff; lingering conceptual questions outweigh character connection.</comment>
