<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s whimsical inventiveness and role as chronicler are clear, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Her motivation aligns with actions, but the character lacks complex internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from environmental decay to the pivotal meltwater drop, with the thermometer’s rise as a clear catalyst. The concise arc is satisfying, though the ending’s thematic weight feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive details (glistening stalactites, warm air) anchor the atmosphere. The setting’s fragility mirrors the theme, though some descriptions verge on excessive without deeper functional purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Haunting metaphors (thermometer as "truthful harbinger," meltwater as "tear") elevate the narrative. Emotional resonance emerges through subtext and symbolic objects, though occasional poetic flourishes risk overshadowing nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with inventive fusion of steampunk and ecological allegory. Language balances precision and lyricism; the "artist’s brush" metaphor and mechanical fortune-tellers feel fresh, with minimal artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates a thematically rich microcosm of environmental collapse. The bittersweet tone and layered symbolism linger, though the brevity occasionally limits deeper exploration.</comment>
