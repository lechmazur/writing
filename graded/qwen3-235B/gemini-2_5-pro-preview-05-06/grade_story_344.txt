<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Omitted interiority and underdeveloped trauma-to-healing arc leave protagonist's transformation feeling abrupt; motivations implied through action but lack visceral specificity in the character's voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes cohere thematically but lack driving conflict; episodic pacing suits contemplative tone but sacrifices narrative urgency within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering (taste of star anise, tremors in hands reaching for jam) creates palpable atmosphere where emotional and physical spaces become intertwined metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric parallels between jam preservation and memory haunt effectively; underdeveloped secondary characters limit emotional impact despite resonant central metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Evasive phrasing ("quietly bold," "lightly heavyhearted") risks abstracting emotion but mostly succeeds through concrete anchoring in taste sensations and physical objects.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element integration is elegant but safe; story feels meticulously constructed rather than organically urgent, lacking electrifying narrative risk-taking.</comment>
