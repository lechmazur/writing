<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise subverts introspection tropes; avoids clich√©s with surreal psychological abduction; some metaphorical abstraction risks ambiguity but not artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohesively explore internal truth-seekin; concise structure serves thematic compression, though tonal shifts and rushed climax hint at word-limit strain.</comment>
