<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism anchors her character, and her motivation to archive storms as emotional preservation is clear. The fusion of method and personality is effective, though emotional depth could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circular structure with rising tension in the storm’s climax, but lacks a strong resolution; pacing manages coherence within constraints but feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (server hums, thimble clicks) immerse readers. The contrast of sterile digitization with storm chaos is evocative, though the setting’s connection to the thimbles could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (thimbles as emotional monuments) and subtext about memory vs. digitization are masterful. The ending’s lingering doubt elevates the thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of sci-fi (digitization) and poetic metaphors avoids clichés. Language is precise but ornate without excess. Emotional resonance emerges through atmosphere, not explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements interweave tightly; the brevity accentuates the story’s haunting tone. Leaves lingering questions about memory and authenticity in a digitized world.</comment>
