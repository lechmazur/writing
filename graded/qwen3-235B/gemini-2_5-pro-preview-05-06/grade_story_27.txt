<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters remain static; Alistair's "politely vindictive" motivation lacks nuanced exploration, reduced to repetitive dialogue. Silas' "stagnant mind" is stated, not demonstrated through layered interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot structure compressed by tight word count sacrifices cohesion; petrification resolution feels abrupt. Causal connection between Silas' choice and punishment lacks psychological or thematic buildup within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative details like "sunburnt skin" peeling paint and avian activity contrast effectively with eerie undertones. Atmosphere occasionally veers into excessive metaphorical overkill without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chilling finality and metaphorical richness (statues as cautionary growth aversion) linger. Subtextual themes of stagnation vs. transformation emerge powerfully, but dialogue leans on expositional truths rather than subtextual tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through precise imagery (warbler chirps against petrification), but lunar phase mechanics echo familiar tropes with insufficient reinvention. Stylistic flourishes occasionally overshadow narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent parable but betray their artificial assignment through thematic scaffolding. Brief format succeeds atmospherically more than thematically; haunting lingers more than philosophical inquiry.</comment>
