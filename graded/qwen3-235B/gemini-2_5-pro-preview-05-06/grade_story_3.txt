<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is consistent but lacks emotional depth; surly demeanor and "serenely frantic" energy are well-established, but internal motivations remain abstract rather than viscerally felt through concrete actions or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence present but minimal; the symbolic weaving as "action" creates cyclical tension rather than progression, leaving resolution ambiguous despite poetic closure. Pacing risks monotony without narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly realized through evocative sensory details (salt-worn stones, wind-as-sighs) and the graveyard's "dignified chaos" mirrors the protagonist's psyche, though the "between seasons" timeframe feels underutilized thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (cosmic patterns as market transactions) and symbolic resonance (yarn constellations), but emotional impact is intellectualized; the ending's linger is conceptual rather than visceral despite memorable imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps (fresh metaphors like "salt and time," nuanced sensory specificity) but occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction ("dignified chaos") and overreliance on conceptual weight over human-scale conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a central metaphor but strain under the weight of their symbolic significance; the brevity works thematically but leaves too many narrative threads (e.g., market wisdom's connection to cosmic patterns) underexplored.</comment>
