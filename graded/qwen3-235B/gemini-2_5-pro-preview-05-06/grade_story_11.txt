<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak character distinctness; motivation clear but psychological complexity underdeveloped. Flighty cartographer trait surfaces inconsistently. Serene anger lacks nuance beyond surface description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression within constraints, but emotional arc remains under-realized. Plot relies on conceptual momentum rather than dramatized cause-effect. Pacing uneven in tighter moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strangely normal setting juxtaposition initially striking but under-utilized. Atmospheric thinness undermines secret society mystique. Sensory details sporadic rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic interplay and symbolic coherence. Painting as map conceit offers intellectual resonance. Subtextual rebellion effective, though emotional payoff muted. Central conflict remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but veers toward conceptual abstraction as default. Mechanic's patch metaphor shows ingenuity, while secret society framework borders on familiar. Language generally purposeful with occasional imprecision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively within conceptual framework but lack visceral interconnectedness. Imposed brevity works both for and againstâ€”focused yet underdeveloped. Lingering thematic question compensates technical brevity limitations.</comment>
