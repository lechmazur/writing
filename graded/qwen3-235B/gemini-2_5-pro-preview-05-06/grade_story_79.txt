<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Brody’s resolve and grief are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict beyond surface-level determination; his ‘voice’ is stylistically rich but one-dimensional as a grieving lawman.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The quiet progression from searching to symbolic resolution works, but the compressed arc feels rushed, especially in transitioning from despair to fragile hope without deeper emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The library’s eerie stillness and sensory details (sunlight, dust, silence) powerfully evoke grief’s weight; the ethereal atmosphere aligns with the chain and celestial theme, though the setting itself could be more distinct.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (“tear of a god”) and lyrical prose deepen the theme, but the narrative’s emotional payoff leans too heavily on descriptive abstraction rather than visceral character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into overly ornate prose; the method of using poetry and science is inventive, but the sheriff’s grief remains archetypal rather than deeply human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion and poetic style elevate it, but the brief arc feels constrained by its form—thematic elements resonate, yet the emotional and conceptual layers lack full realization.</comment>
