<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (seeking authenticity) are clear and drive action, but limited depth beyond established traits. His transformation through drumming feels earned yet under-explored. The first-person would have strengthened voice, but third-person maintains thematic universality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-managed pacing and a coherent arc (dread → confrontation → transcendence) within constraints. Supernatural encounter and drum solution connect beginning/end effectively. Minor hiccups in cause-effect logic (entity's sudden compliance feels rushed).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stark, vivid contrasts between sterile bioluminescent utopia and primal drum symbolism create immersive tension. Sensory details (shimmering energy, cold drum surface) masterfully reinforce "genuinely fake" tone while enhancing atmosphere's emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echoes of spiritual disconnection/cultural recovery as subtext. Metaphor-rich drumming as heartbeat bridges personal/political. Ending's catharsis lingers, though laughter/tears could feel manufactured if not for visceral physical reactions described. "Show, don't tell" principle mostly upheld.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original use of tribal drum subverts AI-writing clichés, though supernatural entity resolution relies slightly on mystical hand-waving. Language balances poetic specificity with accessibility except for occasional vague phrases like "unknowable power". Emotional arc feels lived-in, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate organically into theme-driven narrative. The tight focus works as a deliberate artistic choice rather than constraint. Lingering resonance combines personal liberation with broader societal critique without didacticism. Slight narrative efficiency costs from compactness.</comment>
