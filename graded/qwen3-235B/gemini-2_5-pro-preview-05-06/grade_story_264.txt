<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characters are vividly sketched but lack psychological depth; motivations are clear but mostly surface-level, with insufficient exploration of internal contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies heavily on compressed exposition; pacing feels rushed in key transitions, though the resolution achieves thematic symmetry within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is immersive through precise sensory details (projector hum, refracted light), but the shooting star tracking station's technical elements are underutilized as more than just backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery elevates the story (e.g., stars “breathe”), but emotional resonance is diluted by overreliance on poetic description over character action; ending feels thematically resolved but narratively static.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with inventive combinations (alchemy + tech), but some phrases (“hauntingly cheerful”) verge on abstract vagueness; tone remains consistent without slipping into formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively, though the timeframe feels arbitrarily chosen rather than thematically integral; style balances precision with creativity, leaving a quiet, lingering impact.</comment>
