<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vividly contrasts decaying industrial dystopia with fragile beauty; sensory details about radioactive haze and glitter's texture immerse readers; location's symbolic connection to rebirth enhances thematic resonance</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful imagery ("veins of the earth") and symbolic color metaphors stand out; emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition; "feminize the essence" lacks subtlety; theme of perseverance beneath despair remains compelling</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Wasteland orchard" combines tropes without subverting them; "merry bitterness" conceptually fresh but executed clich√©dly; excessive descriptors ("toxic haze," "perpetual twilight") cross into purple prose; emotional nuance feels surface-level despite aspirational metaphors</comment>
