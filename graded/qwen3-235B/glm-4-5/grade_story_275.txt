<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but execution relies too heavily on passive observation over active choices revealing depth; inner life remains underdeveloped despite lyrical framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot progression through angle-based translation is inventive, though compressed arc feels slightly rushed during symbolic seed sprouting; thematic payoff justifies structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmospheric details (skeletal trees, comet's glow) masterfully create haunting beauty; setting functions almost as a character central to emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of flora as rebellion against cosmic indifference elevates narrative; emotional beats occasionally veered toward poetic abstraction over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Creative integration of flower-album decoding avoids clich√©, but some descriptors (e.g., "deliberate wilderness") border on self-conscious artifice; emotional subtext stays surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion maintained excellent element synergy despite constraints, though certain conceptual connections (weathervane angles to script) rely on suspended disbelief rather than organic logic.</comment>
