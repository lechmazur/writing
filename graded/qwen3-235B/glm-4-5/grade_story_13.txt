<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (tracking evolutionary changes) is explicit but superficially integrated; "solemn" and "mild fervor" manifest as flat descriptors rather than demonstrated traits; actions lack emotional nuance, reducing complexity to archetypes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rigid plot structure (poem → discovery → progression) feels mechanically formulaic; cause-effect ties to concept are logical but mechanical; pacing prioritizes plot over psychological/emotional development, leaving arc feeling artificial within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative fragments (shifting sands, rusted hinges) create atmosphere, but setting remains sketch-like; time decay theme is undercut by lack of tactile details; tone contrasts with action (solemnity vs. mystical garden discovery) feel unearned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery ("garden wisdom transformed into living knowledge") elevates impact, but reliance on declarative exposition ("his motivation strengthen") undermines emotional engagement; theme of time/evolution has conceptual depth but shallow execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Excessive thematic clichés (secret gardens, mystical flora) paired with repetitive descriptors ("functionally dysfunctional") suggest algorithmic pattern generation; emotional beats (determination, reverence) feel imposed rather than organically developed; insufficient tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds in cramming all elements together but lacks artistic cohesion; structural economy serves plot mechanics over thematic resonance; slight intrigue from evolutionary-mysticism interplay is undermined by thin character engagement and predictable poetic clues.</comment>
