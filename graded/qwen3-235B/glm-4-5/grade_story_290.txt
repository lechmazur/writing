<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's intelligently foolish nature is clear but motivations lack visceral depth; reactions to the figurine show some nuance but inner conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with resonant beginning/end; plot relies on implausible figurine mechanics but maintains coherence within its mystical logic despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visual and auditory details create strong atmosphere, but the caves' role feels disconnected from the urban taxi setting; tone contrasts well with cosmic concept but lacks physical integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and metaphorical resonance elevate thematic concerns; dialogue operates on dual levels, though some philosophical exposition risks abstract detachment from emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shapeshifter trope given fresh context, but "overthrow" execution avoids clich√© while the harmonic caves/taxi juxtaposition reveals subtle AI patterning in spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements create thematic resonance rather than feeling forced; brevity serves the concept but some connections between setting pieces remain tenuous.</comment>
