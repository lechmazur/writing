<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (unmasking an icon) is clear but inconsistent with 'jumpy' trait; faltering moment feels rushed; necromantic powers underutilized beyond ritual climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but relies heavily on exposition; system's footsteps as antagonistic force introduced too late; pacing falters during mural explanation; method of paint drip analysis lacks narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pixels, static, and glitching effectively build atmosphere; clashing robe colors and protest mural provide vivid detail; 'digital dust' and hollow code mask are evocative; auditory elements underdeveloped beyond footsteps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Twist about synthetic god creates meaningful tension; imagery of unraveling reality is strong; ending sacrifices resolution for thematic impact; showing through glitching environment superior to exposition; theme of truth vs control resonates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; protest mural metaphor is inventive; system footsteps lean on generic horror tropes; emotional stakes remain surface-level; writing style balances poetic flourishes with clarity; subversion of 'wise mentor' archetype fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly emphasized; some assigned elements (paint drips) feel arbitrary; 'jumpy' and 'bizarre' lack narrative consequence; thematic ambition outweighs emotional execution; conceptually novel but structurally conventional.</comment>
