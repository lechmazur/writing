<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the fusion of gambling and idealism lacks emotional depth. The family tradition and telekinesis connection feels forced rather than organically shaping decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot moves purposefully but rushes between key moments. The action (dice gamble) drives immediate stakes, but the tapestry's decoding feels tacked-on rather than integrated into narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The space pirate setting with dragon tapestries creates intriguing contrasts. However, "sacred disorder" atmosphere is inconsistently maintained with generic tech descriptions that undercut the mystical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors link farming to rebellion, but emotional resonance is diluted by tell-don't-show tendencies. The thematic connection between gambling and ecological balance is conceptually rich but unevenly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fusion of sci-fi and medieval imagery feels conceptually fresh but execution falters into ornate abstractions. Some phrases overexplain (e.g., explicit "whispered secrets" references) rather than trusting reader interpretation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Successfully threads many elements but cohesion wavers. The tapestry's importance and gambling mechanics shine, while family rituals and "sacred disorder" concepts feel imposed rather than naturally evolved.</comment>
