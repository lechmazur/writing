<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Archetypal traits without human nuance; motivation clear but emotional depth feels stated rather than earned through specific actions or reactions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Competent but formulaically combines assigned elements; lacks the innovation and narrative urgency required for high-stakes literary markets.</comment>
