<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation (chaos as justice catalyst) ties to actions but development feels compressed; sentimental bond to hairpin shows but doesn't deepen throughout.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Boast-driven plot progression works but pacing falters—ship's maiden voyage as simultaneity lacks thematic payoff; too many revelations packed into short arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ancient palace atmosphere is thin: crumbling walls and stone columns evoke setting but lack sensory specificity; time period doesn't influence character behavior or conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Thematic strength in "truth over treasure" motif; emotionally affects fall short of visceral impact through over-reliance on telling in key moments ("felt sorrow") instead of symbolic nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Challenges clichés in presenting justice as bloodless revelation—but leans on "wise fool" trope; dialogue feels stylized rather than human, with portentous declarations over understated authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structurally sound but derivative: required elements function without surprising alchemy; theme lingers ("justice through truth"), but brevity prevents transcendent execution.</comment>
