<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation and transformation are clear, but emotional shifts feel accelerated; "seldom odd" remains surface-level, and his distinctiveness in dialogue/narration is understated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; connection between solitude and party is logical yet underdeveloped within the tight word limit, relying on predictable cause-effect without deeper tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Icy lair and board games create a vivid, contrasting atmosphere; sensory details (e.g., laughter "defying thermodynamics") effectively enhance mood, though setting's whimsy occasionally overshadows thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes introspection through symbolism (black rose, garden of life) and subverts isolation/connection tropes; ending resonates thematically but lacks narrative urgency or emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical moments compete with overwrought phrasing and clich√©s (e.g., personified despair, "frost giant's gentleness"). Emotional nuances are mixed between showing and telling, though attempts freshness in the board game contrast.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional coherence with assigned elements, but thematic connections are thin; style leans into poetic abstraction at the cost of depth. The brief length exacerbates underexplored ideas rather than amplifying them.</comment>
