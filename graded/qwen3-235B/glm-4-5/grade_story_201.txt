<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; whimsical trait emerges inconsistently through action rather than shaping inner psychology or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence with clever twist, but emotional payoff feels truncated by word limit; celestial tracking mechanism strains believability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements serve plot with minor contrivances; brevity enhances urgency but weakens thematic payoff; atmospheric details elevate conceptual framework without transforming it.</comment>
