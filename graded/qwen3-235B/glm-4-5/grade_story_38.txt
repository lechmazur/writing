<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Weaknesses: The poet's insomnia and poetic identity lack integration beyond surface descriptors. His transformation via party confessions feels under-explored. Strengths: Motivational throughline of non-violence vs. personal darkness is consistent; botanical interactions reveal character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weaknesses: Resolution feels rushed despite word limits; subway intervals as structural device works but creates artificial pacing. Strengths: Clear arc from isolation to community; elimination method via parties strains credibility but drives plot effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Haunted botanical atmosphere is visceral and original; subway liminality creates haunting temporal dissonance. Weaknesses: Tactile sensory details underdeveloped; empty abundance concept insufficiently embodied beyond metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strengths: Botanical whispers as metaphor for ecological wisdom add depth; emotional undercurrents emerge through setting interactions. Weaknesses: Subtext about artistic creation vs. self-destruction could be more visceral; some poetic abstractions dilute emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weaknesses: Botanical sentience relies on familiar magical realism tropes; party salvation lacks psychological nuance; "meticulous mess" description feels like checklist item.
