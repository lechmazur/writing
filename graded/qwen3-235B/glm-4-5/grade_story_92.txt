<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist's blend of ambition and pretense lacks psychological depth or evolution despite the setting's potential for moral reckoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but feels compressed; key plot beats (theft motivation, silent alliance) emerge yet resolution lacks earned tension or payoff due to underexplored stakes within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere via stained glass and "loud silence" creates mood, but setting doesn't organically pressure characters' choices; the haunted mansion feels aesthetic rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "blood as currency" hint at theme but remain surface-level; dialogue and closing twist prioritize concept over emotional resonance or layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Reliance on genre tropes (haunted houses, blood-as-currency) without subversion; polished phrasing like "carefully careless" often masks hollow characterization and predictable moral ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements function but lack cohesive integration; the premise's ingenuity outpaces execution, with underdeveloped conflict and thematic potential lost in brevity's rush.</comment>
