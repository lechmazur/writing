<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematically linked but the apathy-to-action transition lacks nuanced internal conflict; the summoned coral reefs lack emotional weight despite metaphysical symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure works but plot mechanics (connecting frames via coffee grinder) strain coherence; pacing balances introspection with narrative progression within tight constraints but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ethereal setting blends mysticism with ecological themes but sensory details prioritize poetry over worldbuilding; dream studio's metaphysical rules remain underexplored, weakening atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (river wisdom/coral rebirth) elevate the narrative but emotional beats rely too heavily on telling; theme of post-collapse renewal resonates through coral symbolism but lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of esoteric concepts with tangible objects avoids clich√©; emotional shifts remain abstract but avoid overt "sadness" tells; literary devices feel purposeful despite occasional overpolished prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements converge effectively but unevenly weighted - coffee grinder's significance overshadows frame mechanics; thematic momentum and poetic economy make it feel intentional rather than compressed.</comment>
