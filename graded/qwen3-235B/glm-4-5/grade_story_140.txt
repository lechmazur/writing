<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict and transformation remain superficial; motivations shift abruptly without psychological depth, undermining the weight of their cosmic revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Non-linear structure undermines coherence; repetitive phrasing ("across the hush of dawn's second breath") and compressed arc make the resolution feel abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Abandoned circus setting and sweet decay create immersive juxtapositions, but time compression flattens atmosphere into mere aesthetic without affecting character or plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (doll as prison/key, jasmine/starlight scent) succeed, but over-reliance on poetic description overshadows emotional nuance and narrative economy in the constrained format.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Formulaic cosmic mystery tropes (abandoned spaces, ancient powers) and rhythmic repetition suggest algorithmic defaulting; tone shifts abruptly from brooding to saccharine/surreal without earned transition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of elements lacks bold vision; atmospheric flourishes cannot compensate for underdeveloped thematic coherence and predictable mythopoeic revelations.</comment>
