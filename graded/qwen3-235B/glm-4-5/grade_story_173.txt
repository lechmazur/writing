<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment> Elara's traits (wandering orchardist, plant communication) shape her actions well, but her internal motivations remain underexplored beyond the stated goal of trade route restoration. The phantom hand connection feels underdeveloped, weakening emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment> Plot moves efficiently through the underwater retrieval sequence, but key questions (why Aquilonia's ledger matters, how dimensional shifts work) remain unaddressed. Cause-effect between phantom hand use and ledger activation lacks explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Visceral sensory details about sediment-memories and cold energy create strong atmospheric immersion. Underwater time distortion and ethereal maps add multiversal texture rather than merely serving as set dressing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment> Botanical trade codes and tree spirit bonds suggest depth, but emotional beats rely too often on stated "bittersweet grit" rather than subtle subtext. The phantom hand's significance requires more symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment> While avoiding overt clich√©s, the structure leans heavily on "rescue artifact from ancient ruin" tropes. Some phrases ("weight of history but light with hope") veer toward melodrama that dilutes thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment> Elements function collectively but lack synergistic integration - the kitchen table wisdom and multiverse frame remain conceptually parallel rather than intersecting. The ending's thematic closure feels insufficiently earned.</comment>
