<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is abstract and emotionally distant, with minimal internal conflict rendering reactions predictable. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot movement exists but feels forced by thematic elements rather than organic progression. Resolution relies on concept over narrative cohesion within tight constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function technically but lack transformative unityâ€”individual pieces fascinate while the whole remains impressionistic rather than resonant.</comment>
