<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (guilt/redemption), but "unusually normal" trait feels underdeveloped. Interactions with ghosts reveal depth but lack concrete behavioral specifics tied to his con artist past. Tape dispenser's symbolic role remains repetitive rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows static nightly pattern rather than progression. Circular structure works within constrained word count but lacks traditional arc. Ghost dialogues repeat thematic points without building narrative momentum. Ending hint at confession fails to materialize as concrete resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dystopian decay is visually present but atmospheric details remain generalized (rusted equipment, gray skies). The ghosts as "broken dreams" metaphor works but environmental interactions feel surface-level. Sensory details about the farm's sensory degradation (smells, textures) are missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in tape dispenser/con artist duality. Ending's potential tension between confession and avoidance collapses into passivity. Subtext about seeking intangible redemption through tangible remnants of past life is compelling. Dialogue with ghosts shows emotional nuance rather than stating themes directly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids typical ghost-story tropes by making spirits manifestations of collective human failure rather than scare tactics. Tape dispenser as literal and metaphorical "empty vessel" shows ingenuity. Some phrases ("gathering darkness of a world he helped create") border on clich√© but overall maintains distinct voice through metaphorical restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements function together but connections feel strained in places - the "mild fervor" tone conflicts with his resignation. Ghost-interrogation method dominates disproportionately to other assigned aspects. The dystopian farm primarily serves as convenient backdrop rather than shaping character's emotional journey. Lingering questions about redemption remain unearned.</comment>
