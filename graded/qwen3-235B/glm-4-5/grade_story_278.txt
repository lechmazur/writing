<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weaks in internal conflict depth; brooding trait isn't fully excavated. Glasses-as-motif well-handled but escapes feel overly passive despite physicality of sculptor's work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Disappearance mechanics lack tangible stakes; pacing mostly controlled but car-washing-as-cover feels contrived. Closure achieved with lingering mystery rather than narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric precision in sensory details (dust/water) elevates. The crater base's claustrophobia effectively amplifies tension between entrapment and dissolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphoric transformation resonates; symbolism of unfinished sculptures as narrative device works. Emotional subtext implied but occasionally soft-focus rather than piercing insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten passages ("murky desire") undercut otherwise fresh imagery. Subversion of escape via disintegration prevents formulaic outcomes, but some descriptors strain authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Elements interwoven with purpose; short-form limitations expose thinness in conspiracy elements. Leaves resonance through poetic closure but lacks structural ambition within constraints.</comment>
