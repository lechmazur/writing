<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Predictable motivational arc despite surreal elements; "personally impersonal" remains nebulous concept rather than revealing true character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fractured coherence due to abrupt transitions between oil changes and cathedral; plot momentum collapses under weight of excessive conceptual baggage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Unsettling originality in cathedral-orphaned object juxtapositions; only occasionally undermined by stock mystical language about bees as cosmic messengers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overloaded with mandatory elements that feel like narrative struts rather than organic components; conceptual scaffolding visible beneath surface.</comment>
