<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters show minimal active motivation; "zealot" label lacks behavioral grounding. Spiritual realization feels narrated rather than demonstrated through evolving actions. No dialogue to establish distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abstract meditation on sacrifice rather than traditional plot. Clear thematic bookends with underdeveloped tension. Arc exists conceptually but lacks narrative momentum in tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Brass mechanisms and mahogany tables create vivid scholarly atmosphere. Sensory details inconsistent - emphasizes visual/spatial elements while neglecting other senses that could deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Repetitive use of "rustic refinement" and similar phrases weakens originality. Subverts "mad scientist" trope but descends into abstract generalizations that could suggest algorithmic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually dense but emotionally distant. Assigned elements fit logically but lack alchemical cohesion. Theme of transformation remains more intellectual concept than lived experience.</comment>
