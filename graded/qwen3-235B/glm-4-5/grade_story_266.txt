<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imaginative elements avoid formulaic writing but occasionally veer into baroque excess; emotional subtext often stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements merge with distinctive tone, but cohesion suffers from uneven integration of abstract concepts; impressionistic style sometimes sacrifices narrative clarity.</comment>
