<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character has strong established traits, but the transformation feels abrupt despite the emotional awakening. Motivation to preserve knowledge connects to rebelliousness but the leap to altar-building lacks psychological nuance. The mitten does reveal his latent vulnerability, but inner conflict remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from detachment to compassion exists, but the secret agent setting introduces friction with folk remedies without clear narrative payoff. The altar's implementation feels narratively disconnected from the espionage elements. Pacing is efficient but pivotal emotional beats lack development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses vivid sensory details effectively (frost, lantern light) but the secret agent center jars with the folkloric altar concept. Timeframe enhances isolation, while the merging of espionage infrastructure with supernatural domestic traditions creates dissonance that weakens immersive cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (mittens as heart, armor as emotional barrier) resonate powerfully. The ending's thematic symmetry works, but the rebellion as nurturing idea would carry greater weight with clearer showing of his internal struggle rather than telling about emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blends intriguingly unique elements (espionage vs altars) but suffers from mechanical transitions between concepts. Some poetic imagery counterbalanced by uneven tone shifts. Folk remedies and knightly discipline feel organic, but the secret center and lawful rebelliousness require more grounded integration to avoid feeling algorithmically juxtaposed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains narrative integrity despite uneven element fusion. The knight's arc delivers emotional resonance, though thematic cohesion is compromised by overambitious layering. The ending lingers conceptually, but structural looseness around world-building prevents full immersion.</comment>
