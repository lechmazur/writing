<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strengths in establishing the watchman's obsession with cosmic patterns, but surface-level exploration of his isolation and surly demeanor. Motivation remains consistent, but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression from ritual to revelation works within constraints, though the resolution feels abrupt. Pacing is deliberate but could deepen tension between cosmic discovery and mortality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Masterful sensory immersion in the graveyard's liminal space; salt-etched epitaphs, seasonal winds, and celestial imagery unify the atmospheric tone and thematic tension between life/death, order/chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose contains striking metaphors and layered symbolism (yarn=cosmic map, knots=duality of existence), but emotional impact diluted by occasional abstract exposition rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Refreshing use of nautical mysticism avoids generic magic realism tropes. Some ornate phrasing, but overall voice feels distinct. Subtext about human attempts to impose order on the unknowable resonates organically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elegantly ties elements into thematic tapestry about interconnectedness of life, death, and cosmic order. Strong atmospheric unity, though the market wisdom concept feels like a missed opportunity for deeper metaphorical exploration.</comment>
