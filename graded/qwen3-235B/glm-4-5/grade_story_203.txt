<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Protagonist’s stage fright and inherited trauma are hinted but underdeveloped; motivation to rectify grandmother’s lies is clear but lacks emotional depth; character’s voice remains diffuse despite third-person proximity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Opening and resolution connect through inherited truth, but pivotal revelation about the grandmother feels rushed; key beats of exorcism are coherent, but some logical gaps (e.g., drones’ relevance) disrupt momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Orbital debris and toy drones create vivid, memorable atmosphere; tone balances melancholy and defiance, but sensory details uneven—drones buzz and debris shimmers without deeper integration into emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Twist subverts exorcism tropes effectively; metaphors (wildflowers/pressed memories) enrich subtext; ending transcends genre, prioritizing liberation over defeat, though some emotional beats rely on vague abstraction (“truth bloomed”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through space setting and non-traditional exorcism, but contains ornate phrasing (“truth and fiction blurred like stars in a nebula”); emotional shifts are partially stated rather than dramatized, slightly flattening depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere mostly through theme rather than organic interplay; orbital setting and wildflowers succeed, but toy assembly drones and “defiant hush” feel peripheral; concept execution is clever but unevenly woven into narrative fabric.</comment>
