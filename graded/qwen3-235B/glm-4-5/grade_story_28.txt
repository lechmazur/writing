<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's professional motivation as an archivist is clear, but "slyness" remains superficial. The emotional shift to desperate optimism feels imposed rather than organically developed through concrete actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a ghost-hunter arc with functional progression, but the central revelation about visitors disappearing lacks narrative buildup. The fork's supernatural activation feels like a convenient gimmick rather than earned progression within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich carnival decay (rusted colors, echoing footsteps) powerfully immerses readers. The setting-as-living-archive metaphor gains emotional force through tactile details like the vibrating fork, though sonic/spatial elements could be more precisely executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative central metaphor about cultural preservation resonates beyond the genre trappings. The "desperate optimism" tone is conceptually compelling, though emotional impact diluted by passive voice and explanatory adjectives rather than visceral characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar haunted-location tropes. Strong moments of specificity (vibrating utensil as key) contrast with generic descriptors ("living archive of human experience"). Tone shifts occasionally feel didactic rather than experiential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Competently constructed but overly reliant on atmospheric shorthand. The strongest elements (fork's transformation, setting specificity) coexist with formulaic ghost-hunting framework. Cohesion exists but lacks the transcendent originality required for prestigious publication.</comment>
