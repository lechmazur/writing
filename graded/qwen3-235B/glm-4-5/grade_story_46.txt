<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually rich but lack emotional texture; the blank-faced performer's obsession feels intellectualized rather than psychologically embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but relies heavily on poetic abstraction over narrative momentum; the revelation lacks concrete stakes despite atmospheric elegance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid, synesthetic descriptions create a haunting dreamscape where setting and tone fuse seamlessly – the waterfalls’ roar juxtaposing piano melodies exemplifies masterful atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (celestial patterns as "lens to another world") and thematic resonance about language vs. experience elevate the craft, though emotional immediacy is diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures; the fusion of mythic guardian archetype with prosaic plastic ring and scientific obsession avoids AI-generated tropes, though some phrases ("melancholic melody") teeter on conventionality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; surreal beauty masks thinness of narrative progression, though thematic unity and final imagery linger powerfully.</comment>
