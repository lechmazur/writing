<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While Fern’s sentience and internal conflict between comfort and curiosity are evident, their motivations lack depth beyond a surface-level yearning for knowledge. The "scalding ambivalence" is stated but not fully embodied through actions or decisions that reconcile their apathetic devotion with their restlessness, leaving the character’s transformation feeling underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The decision to "outrun" the owner’s return drives the plot, but the journey to the drive-in feels rushed, glossing over specific obstacles or revelations tying to Fern’s ability to "tend to the unspoken." The arc—a return to the windowsill—is conceptually clear but strained by compressed pacing that undercuts emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned drive-in’s decay is vividly sketched (torn screen, overgrown parking lot), but the setting’s atmospheric potential clashes with Fern’s domestic origin. Sensory details are sparse aside from the glowing bookmark; the "new neighborhood" lacks distinct texture, weakening the connection between Fern’s movement and the environment’s role in amplifying their restlessness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of unspoken secrets as cinematic projections is poignant, and the closing image of Fern as a keeper of buried stories resonates. Emotional beats are often told rather than shown (e.g., "scalding ambivalence" without tangible consequences), but the central idea—of hidden knowledge as both a burden and a bond—lends thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in anthropomorphizing a houseplant with psychic empathy elevates the story, but phrasing like "scalding ambivalence" and "whispering through leaves" leans toward clichéd abstraction. Fern’s journey relies on predictable whimsy (sentient plant = emotional metaphor), though the drive-in’s lost-film-reel twist is a clever subversion of "hidden knowledge" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story’s ambition outpaces execution; the assigned elements are present but unevenly integrated. The drive-in’s lore and bookmark’s symbolism create lingering intrigue, yet the constraint feels visible—moments of introspection are abbreviated, and the return to the windowsill lacks the poignancy of a truly transformed perspective.</comment>
