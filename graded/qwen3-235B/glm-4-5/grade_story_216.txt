<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation for decoding symbols is clear, but character remains an enigmatic cipher rather than a psychologically nuanced figure. Actions align with assigned traits yet lack emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through structured rituals but lacks dramatic tension. Revelation feels preordained rather than earned through narrative development. Closure exists but feels perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere created through mist, moonlight and phone interference is striking. Spatial details vivid but disconnected from character's inner world or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness in washed symbols and scapegoat duality is undercut by overly explicit exposition. The ending's thematic resonance feels superficial rather than transformative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Unconventional premise is diluted by archetypal phrasing ("sacred symbols", "ancient wisdom") and clinical emotional cadence that undermines the mystical elements' credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of required elements creates surface cohesion, but mechanical integration—particularly between setting and character function—prevents full narrative transcendence.</comment>
