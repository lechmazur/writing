<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's timidity is stated but not fully embodied in actions; motivation to fulfill childhood promise drives the plot organically, though the shift from passivity to leadership lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Limited word count manages complete arc from passive mourning to active healing. Plot driven by object and concept, but the transition to community action feels slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (cedar's scent, industrial decay) and symbolic fusion of Greek myth with industrial decay create immersive atmosphere that deeply reinforces themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors and symbolic layering elevate thematic resonance. Ending achieves emotional closure through action rather than statement, with subtext about collective memory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in blending mythic and industrial elements, though some metaphor density borders on purple prose ("rivers of ancient Greece"). Emotional nuance in quiet courage feels authentic despite third-person.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are organically interwoven rather than checklisted; brevity amplifies poetic impact. Leaves lingering questions about the relationship between personal and collective healing.</comment>
