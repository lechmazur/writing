<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious metaphors occasionally verge on abstraction, but the poetic tone and subversion of the "failed predecessor" trope avoid formulaic outcomes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements blend into a thematically unified whole, though some narrative choices (e.g., skeleton reveal) feel slightly predictable despite their functional execution.</comment>
