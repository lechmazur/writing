<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's static existence lacks evolution; contradictory traits stated rather than demonstrated. Motivation exists but isn't deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows cyclical structure with minimal progression; beginning/end connection exists but lacks emotional payoff or meaningful narrative shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-flood atmosphere is evocative with concrete sensory details (lavender's scent, salt-crusted memories), though setting doesn't actively shape plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong use of cosmic metaphors and thematic resonance, but emotional depth often relies on abstract statements rather than embodied subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("palpable enthusiasm") and thematic repetition; avoids major AI clich√©s but shows occasional overprecision (e.g., "methodically random").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</question><comment>Elements superficially integrated; lavender bundle and "unknown galaxy" motif stand out, but setting and method feel loosely connected to core themes.</comment>
