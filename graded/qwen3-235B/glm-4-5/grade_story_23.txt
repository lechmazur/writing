<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lacks depth in internal character logic; motivations and personality traits are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete, nuanced actions. The bard feels like a generic archetype with minimal emotional or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is loosely coherent but lacks causality; the climax relies on a coincidental act (orchard keeper) that feels tacked on. Resolution rushes past complexity, leaving key causal links unexplored and the arc feeling incomplete within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on heavy-handed descriptors rather than immersive, specific sensory details. Setting elements (solar wind, orchard) coexist without meaningful interplay; the "phantasmal humor" tone is inconsistently applied and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of cosmic imagery and symbolism, but emotional resonance is diluted by overreliance on poetic abstraction. The ending attempts thematic closure (renewal, hope) but lacks the weight to make these ideas feel earned or deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Floral phrases and cosmic metaphors veer into purple prose. Some fresh touches (leaves as "conduits") undercut by generic descriptors ("heartbeat of the world"). Emotion is implied through action but feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are superficially cohesive but lack symbiotic integration. The tight word limit exacerbates a sense of thematic surface skimming; the ending feels contrived rather than resonant, leaving the impression of a half-realized concept.</comment>
