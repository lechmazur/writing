<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's muteness is integral to communication through Charlie, but motivation to 'archive human connections' lacks psychological depth and evolves vaguely.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc from isolation to connection, but pacing falters with abrupt shifts between weather obsession and human interactions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (iridescent sand, triple moons) create intrigue, but the parallel universe's scientific/mystical aspects remain superficially explored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual fusion of muteness and ventriloquism is fresh, but 'euphoric agitation' feels like an authorial affectation rather than organic emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist without seamless integration - the parallel universe and temporal framing feel like backdrops rather than vital to the redefining family theme.</comment>
