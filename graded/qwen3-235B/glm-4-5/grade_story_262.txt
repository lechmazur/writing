<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization is superficial, relying on abstract descriptors over psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized; inconsistent internal logic (how does an alien require disguises when "righteously flawed" implies visibility of flaws?)</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative compression creates artificial transitions; plot mechanics (puzzle tile discovery via organ) lack causal logic; resolution feels imposed rather than earned through character action</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting exists primarily as metaphor (bathhouse=rebirth, organ=sadness) without material specificity; missed opportunities for tactile historical contrast between Roman past and sci-fi present</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stilted metaphoric repetition ("fiercely tender") undermines emotional authenticity; theme of fear vs. knowledge remains didactic rather than visceral; lacks narrative subtext</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Excessive use of abstraction ("vibrations of lost knowledge") over concrete imagery; clich√©d binaries (fear/bravery) replace nuanced psychological exploration; tonal shifts feel arbitrary</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Surface coherence achieved through checklist use of elements, but thematic unity remains shallow; speculative components function more as genre decor than integral narrative force</comment>
