<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but thinly realized; internal contradictions stated more than dramatized, with motivations implied through abstraction rather than concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative momentum stumbles between metaphysical concepts and literal actions; cause/effect logic dissolves at key transitions between marble cracks, puzzle edges, and cosmic rebalancing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lunar setting lacks tactile immediacy; sterile colony atmosphere only superficially connects to the prophet's spiritual mission, with minimal sensory immersion beyond vague references to machinery hums.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Poetic language and paradoxical motifs ("happily sad") create intellectual resonance, though emotional weight remains ethereal rather than visceral; succeeds as mood poem more than narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original metaphysical premise undermined by overuse of abstractions like "bashful arrogance" that feel contrived rather than organically psychological; inconsistent stylistic register fluctuates between mystical and clinical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels calculated rather than organic; striking imagery fails to coalesce into unified thematic power, though the cosmic rebirth conceit lingers conceptually.</comment>
