<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Abstract, metaphorical approach fails to develop a coherent personality or emotional depth; motivation is stated but not dramatized or interrogated. Motivation to "map consciousness flows" lacks psychological grounding or earned transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Pseudo-plot exists as thematic cycle rather than narrative progression; repetitive descriptions substitute for causal momentum. No discernible stakes or conflict resolution despite tight word count. Abstraction undermines structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Visually evocative but emotionally sterile environment; reliance on vague descriptors ("realistically imaginary") over concrete sensory engagement. Atmosphere operates independently of character psychology rather than enhancing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery (origami glowing with "otherworldly light") countered by heavy-handed symbolic over-explanation. Lacks emotional authenticity beneath poetic gestures; thematic concerns about legacy remain intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on conceptual abstraction produces artificial "depth." Recurring phrases like "fathomless gaze" feel algorithmically reinforced rather than authorially controlled. Attempts at lyrical prose frequently collapse into self-parodying metaphor clusters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements function as disconnected symbols rather than organic components of narrative. Surreal framework prioritizes aesthetic over meaning. Formal experimentation fails to transcend gimmickry to achieve genuine thematic cohesion.</comment>
