<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's strategic motivation is intriguing but underexplored; the "sweetly confrontational" trait feels surface-level despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Narrative lacks clear plot progression; thematic echoes between beginning/middle/end are minimal despite cosmic grandeur.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is striking but uneven—juxtaposition of quasars and beekeeping creates dissonance rather than cohesion; sparse sensory detail.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery occasionally veers into cliché ("ancient light") but avoids significant formulaic structures; tone remains distinct if uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements exist alongside each other rather than throughlines; ambitious concept falls short of literary cohesion required for top-tier publishability.</comment>
