<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's brazenness and impulsiveness are shown through bold actions (entering dangerous lab, drawing protective circle), but motivations tied to betrayal feel somewhat superficially layered beyond surface revenge tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Focused structure maintains coherence within constraints, but the climax feels abrupt—transitioning from finding charcoal to confrontation lacks escalation that would make warning feel earned rather than plot-convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (crushing pressure, warmth of charcoal, murky agents approaching) create immersive atmosphere where underwater decay mirrors societal collapse, though the setting's full potential isn't mined beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echoes of betrayal create thematic resonance; ending delivers poignant message about resilience. However, reliance on telling ("transforming pain into purpose") weakens emotional impact compared to subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original use of superstitions and charcoal avoids complete predictability, but the social upheaval context feels generic, and character reasoning occasionally leans on clichéd tropes (orphaned hero, dying genius) without subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong central conflict and atmospheric cohesion elevate the story above average, though its brevity leaves some elements underexplored. The thematic message lingers, but execution occasionally betrays formulaic tendencies.</comment>
