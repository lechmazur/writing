<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation alignment; sharp wit compensates for underdeveloped linguistic ineptitude. The patch's symbolic weight drives action better than abstract prophecy elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from denial to acceptance, but prophecy resolution feels rushed. Family photo ritual's connection to chamber mechanics remains underexplored within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrast between water/steam and chamber lights works, but sci-fi elements lack cohesive integration. Shipwreck atmosphere competes uneasily with domestic ritual.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chamber's visual metaphors and tactile dance descriptions create emotional resonance. Prophecy twist lacks originality despite effective physical storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Machine-generated tics present ("sharp-witted dancer with...mind of a chess master"). Strong subtext beneath bubble bath surface, but some purple prose ("ambivalence...warring with fear").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work through sheer narrative force rather than elegant design. The metaphor of submerged truth-as-rhythm resonates despite contrived conceptual scaffolding.</comment>
