<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is semi-cogent but lacks psychological depth; the missionary's internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral, weakening emotional stakes. The fork's symbolic role is clearer than the character's transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic gestures rather than organic cause-and-effect. The piano method feels arbitrarily imposed rather than logically embedded in the worldbuilding, weakening narrative coherence despite a clear beginning/middle/end structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</comment>Atmosphere dazzles visually but fails to ground emotional reality. Sensory details prioritize aesthetic over experiential immersion (e.g., "dying embers" of monarchs clich√©). Glass desert exists as poetic concept rather than active narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors elevate themes of duality, and the fork's metamorphosis offers emotional resonance. Over-reliance on "showing" through heavy-handed symbols occasionally cheapens impact. Ending's thematic neatness undercuts potential ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ornate description ("otherworldly hum," "capriciously consistent patterns") often substitutes for genuine originality. The piano method feels like mystical abstraction rather than fresh interpretation. Overused "divided soul" trope diminishes thematic surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly unified. The piano/conduit concepts strain toward synthesis while atmospheric details often exist as standalone poetic fragments rather than narrative drivers. Transformation arc feels perfunctory rather than earned.</comment>
