<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on contradictory descriptors ("angry peace") suggests artificial profundity; repetitive phrasing ("imperfect knowledge," "extinct crafts") indicates conceptual redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synthesis; thematic message feels predetermined rather than discovered; prose overcompensates with dense symbolism at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
