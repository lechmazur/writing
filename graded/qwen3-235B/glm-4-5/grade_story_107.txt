<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation lacks psychological depth; transformation feels imposed rather than earned through nuanced behavior. Telling about "bitter honey" motivation weakens emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Premise collapses under word limit: sudden illness-to-redemption arc strains credibility; sabotage plot introduced too late to cohere with earlier atmospheric focus.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Insect symphony hall" shows promise but remains atmospheric window-dressing; failed opportunity to integrate soundscape with character's psychological erosion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bitter honey" and typewriter silence gesture at theme but lean on recognizable symbolism rather than original imagery; emotional impact undercut by passive narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Generative AI fingerprints evident: "shadowy organization" cliche, flat "guardian" figure; verbose description substitutes for genuine emotional resonance; inconsistent tonal control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element checklist assembled rather than organically fused; thematic scaffolding (redemption through artifact preservation) feels externally imposed rather than emergent from narrative logic.</comment>
