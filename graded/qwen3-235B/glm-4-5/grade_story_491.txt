<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains flat; motivations tied to "seeking wisdom" lack psychological depth or personal stakes. Flashbacks to apprenticeship hint at backstory but don't clarify his present drive. Torn wristband's emotional significance remains underdeveloped despite its physical presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mystical arc with cause-effect coherence in quilt unraveling's physical/emotional consequences. Pacing manages cyclical structure (lullaby beginning/ending) and metamorphic transformation within constraints, though the greenhouse's role as active antagonist remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines humid greenhouse decay with spectral plant revival effectively, but extinct flora function more as scenic backdrop than integral setting. Sensory details (quilt shimmer, wristband glow) enhance mood but lack organic connection to character's tactile experience of the world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (butterflies as disseminated knowledge) and paradoxical concepts ("serene" vs. metaphysical danger) skillfully. Subtext about preservation vs. revelation works thematically. Ending achieves poetic resonance but risks sentimentality through explicit "profound respect" declaration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Contains moments of original imagery (quilt dissolution, spectral vegetation) but leans on well-worn magical realism tropes (ancient texts, mystical quests). Predictable character logic ("acknowledged genius transforming into respect") dampens emotional surprise despite atmospheric uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synergy - greenhouse environment doesn't pressure character choices, wristband's transformation lacks narrative setup. Achieves conceptual ambition but execution creates friction between abstract themes and grounded details like calloused fishing hands.</comment>
