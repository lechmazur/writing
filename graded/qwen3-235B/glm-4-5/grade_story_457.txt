<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but rushes from discovery to revelation; pacing compresses crucial developments, leaving some cause-effect relationships under-realized within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses cosmic metaphors effectively but underutilizes the observation deck setting; sensory details remain abstract rather than visceral, diluting immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in combining hermit/typewriter/zipper concepts undercut by overreliance on philosophical abstraction over human nuance; avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into self-indulgent prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic skeleton undermined by underdeveloped narrative muscle; assigned elements interact meaningfully but unevenly, with some feeling more schematic than organic.</comment>
