<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's contradictory traits (docile/bruiser/brash tenderness) create superficial complexity, but lack psychological depth; motivation shift from resurrection to plant communion is logical yet emotionally remote</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Twist-driven plot maintains internal logic within tight constraints; some compressed beats (baton's reveal, consciousness evolution) undermine pacing precision</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lushly rendered but inconsistently integrated setting (man-eaters, glass corridors); sensory details enhance tone but drum solos remain arbitrary atmospheric device</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stylistic verve and thematic ambition elevate story; lacks emotional visceral punch; translation-as-resurrection metaphor intellectually rewarding but emotionally detached</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subverts resurrection trope effectively; occasional overwritten phrases ("carved through reality", "brash tenderness") and structural predictability prevent perfect originality</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into surprising thematic resolution; prose fluency and structural economy demonstrate craft despite minor tonal dissonances between components</comment>
