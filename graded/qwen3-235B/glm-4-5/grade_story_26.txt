<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but thinly explored; their internal struggle with shame and fragmented identity lacks psychological depth despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from obsession to catharsis, though the condensed structure sacrifices nuanced cause-effect clarity between DNA work and emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Visually vivid but disconnected; cyberpunk aesthetics don't meaningfully intersect with the DNA/bell metaphor to influence the protagonist's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate themes of connection, but emotional beats rely too heavily on abstract description rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality in DNA-animated bell concept undercut by clich√©d cyberpunk elements and overwrought phrasing that sometimes veers into self-parody.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but uneven; elements cohere superficially rather than thematically, leaving a sense of missed opportunity for deeper metaphor.</comment>
