<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s intellectualism and social awkwardness are established but underdeveloped; her reliance on the doll lacks emotional depth, and the transformation of weakness into strength is too simplistic to fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but relies heavily on coincidence; the sudden bay reaction to art feels unearned, and the arc is compressed, leaving key beats underexplored despite functional structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vividly rendered, but the post-FTL setting adds little beyond a throwaway line; sensory details are strong but unevenly distributed across elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., transient art mirroring fragility) and atmospheric imagery elevate the tale, but over-reliance on summary (“awkward elegance,” “determination”) weakens emotional immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on underdog tropes without subverting them; the porcelain doll and bioluminescence show some originality, but the “heralded outsider” arc and vague FTL context read as generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are present but inconsistently integrated; the bay’s role is cohesive, but FTL and “fashionably timeless” feel tacked on; the theme of fragility-as-strength lacks sufficient narrative payoff.</comment>
