<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Attempts to contrast prudence with secret curiosity are undermined by shallow execution. Motivation lacks layering beyond generic ancestral search. Assigned attribute of cheerfulness feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically integrated through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints. Cryptic pattern revelation as climax works, but the connection between tile patterns and letters lacks sufficient groundwork. Pacing efficient but somewhat schematic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Visually rich but inconsistent atmospheric logic - "shifting architecture" contradicts "ancient palace" foundation. Sensory details abundant yet unevenly weighted. The Minoan elements feel superficial rather than culturally embedded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery of shadows and shifting realities creates lingering unease. Subtext about heritage's weight effective, though emotional beats sometimes told rather than shown. Ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Minoan palace reimagined contains original touches but remains surface-level exoticism. Cryptic letters follow trope templates with minor twists. Overly neat binder ring symbolism feels contrived despite atmospheric integration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into functional narrative but lack symbiotic depth. Several elements (shifting architecture, cheerful stoicism) feel decorative rather than essential. Technical execution solid but thematic ambition undercooked.</comment>
