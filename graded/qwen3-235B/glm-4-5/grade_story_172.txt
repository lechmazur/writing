<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is minimally defined through poetic gestures rather than psychological depth; motivation is clear but operates more as thematic concept than lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear progression undermines coherence; abrupt dimensional shift to beach lacks narrative scaffolding, but the cyclical structure (hallway/bookends) provides formal unity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually evocative but thematically underdeveloped; atmosphere works harder than character to convey meaning through precise architectural metaphors and liminal spaces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic architecture resonates thematically; prose contains poetic gravity but occasionally obscures emotional immediacy; twist subverts doomsday tropes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose and metaphysical handwavium, but the conceptual inversion of "reversed wishes" and architectural symbolism demonstrate inventive thinking within genre constraints.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptually elegant but emotionally distant; executes formal elements expertly without fully transcending its archetypal scaffolding; publishable but not definitive.</comment>
