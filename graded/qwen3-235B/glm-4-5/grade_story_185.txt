<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; traits like 'peculiar' and 'calm' shape surface actions but lack inner conflict or nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through abstract descriptions rather than concrete cause-effect; the arc is visible but feels rushed, resolution lacks earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich visual imagery (holographic data, crumbling pencil) enhances atmosphere, but sensory details and integration of setting (probability center) remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (keys as probabilities, graphite's "inner light") elevate the narrative, but emotional resonance is unevenâ€”subtle craft clashes with abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by generic descriptors ("entropy," "final stand") and formulaic cosmic stakes; prose veers toward excess ornamentation without sufficient emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't fully interdependent; the ending feels conceptually tidy rather than earned, with themes gestured toward rather than deeply examined.</comment>
