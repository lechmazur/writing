<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character functions as a thematic vessel, but lacks distinct personality beyond symbolic purpose. Actions align with stated traits but motivations remain abstract, more philosophical conceit than humanized drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Static moment masquerades as narrative progression. Conceptual circularity exists between beginning/end but lacks tangible plot mechanics. Pacing suffocates rather than escalates.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Abandoned repair bay offers effective visual contrast, but sensory details remain surface-level. Atmosphere leans too heavily on gothic clichés without deeper integration into character or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic resonance around perpetual beginnings works well, but emotional impact remains intellectual rather than visceral. Heavy reliance on metaphysical abstraction dilutes tangible character/storytelling interplay.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Rhétorical flourishes border on self-parody with "prickly wonder" and "wilderness wisdom." Overwrought abstractions and lack of concrete character grounding suggest algorithmic flourish-seeking rather than organic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coherence exists through thematic repetition rather than narrative purpose. Assigned elements superficially interlocked but lack deeper functional interdependence. Lingering impressions remain vague.</comment>
