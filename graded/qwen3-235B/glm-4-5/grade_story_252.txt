<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character's penitence is clear but underdeveloped; motivations shift without depth, and the "lovingly hateful" attribute is stated rather than embodied through nuanced internal conflict or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels compressed; the method of tracking petals lacks logical integration, and resolution occurs abruptly without sufficient emotional or narrative buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vault's "icy warmth" and sensory details create a vivid, haunting atmosphere; however, the connection between the preservation of fruit and memory feels conceptually underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyrical imagery and symbolic use of petals/anchor evoke mood, but emotional resonance relies on abstraction over concrete "showing," undercutting its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by reliance on familiar tropes (crack in reality, redemption arc); poetic language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction rather than deep originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack cohesive synthesis; the story leans on juxtaposition rather than organic integration, though the theme of fragility lingers compellingly.</comment>
