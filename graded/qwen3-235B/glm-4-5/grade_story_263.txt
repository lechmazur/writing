<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's zealotry is inconsistent with his non-confrontational, reflective methods; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth. The plush's significance is underdeveloped as a catalyst for his worldview.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but relies on abrupt shifts in faction behavior without showing gradual influence of his storytelling; pacing feels engineered rather than earned through emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Reef city's aesthetic is vivid but underexploited as narrative machinery; symbiotic metaphors are superficially deployed rather than deeply integrated into the factions' conflicts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses symbolism effectively, but theme of moral relativity is stated rather than dramatized; ending resolves too neatly without grappling with complexity of reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in premise but occasionally slips into didacticism; plush and "reversed echoes" demonstrate ingenuity, while some sentence constructions verge on flowery abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative interdependence; length feels restrictive rather than purposeful; philosophical theme lacks visceral emotional grounding for lasting impact.</comment>
