<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's personal detachment inconsistently portrayed; emotional shift at the end feels unearned despite initial precision. Motivation is clear but lacks depth in how it informs specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc, but pacing stumbles—exposition weighs down momentum. Temporal concepts are underutilized in driving the action cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting/timeframe interplay is vivid and immersive. Time-folding enhances atmosphere and plot, though sensory details could be more varied to deepen mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of beauty in imperfection are memorable. Subtext about temporal connection resonates, but emotional beats rely too heavily on summary rather than layered imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Language occasionally dips into ornate phrasing without purpose. Some transitions (e.g., sudden emotional shift) feel forced, and metaphors are inconsistently fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Elements are serviceable but not indispensable—many could be swapped with minimal impact. Story’s creativity lies in premise, not execution of assigned components.</grade>
