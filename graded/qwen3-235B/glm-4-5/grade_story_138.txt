<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Weak character dimensionality; motivations (self-redemption through truth) are stated but not demonstrated through concrete actions. The noble's introspective monologue feels more like thematic scaffolding than authentic psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression: the narrative exists in thematic circles rather than forward momentum. The lab setting and ticket reassembly provide structural scaffolding but fail to create a compelling story engine within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is conceptually strong (the spontaneous combustion lab's danger as metaphor) but execution remains abstract. Sensory details are superficially rendered, with no tangible sense of place beyond conceptual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion through fire/metaphorical combustion works well. The artificial hummingbird's quiet loyalty provides emotional counterpoint to human betrayal. Over-reliance on direct philosophical statements undermines immersive storytelling potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resists genre tropes through poetic metaphors but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction that feels rehearsed. Some phrases ("hollow recklessness") appear as affectations rather than discoveries. Emotional subtext often stated rather than enacted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements work thematically but feel like curated symbols rather than organic components. The brief format enhances introspection but strains narrative urgency. Lingering emotional impact derives from concept rather than execution.</comment>
