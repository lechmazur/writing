<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character acts consistently with assigned traits but remains symbolic rather than fully realized; motivation is clear but underexplored, lacking humanizing contradictions or nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Static structure emphasizes atmosphere over narrative progression; lacks traditional arc but establishes cohesion between post-collapse setting and preservation theme within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in acid rain forest with specific details (corrosive downpour, mutated flora) that amplify thematic resonance of decay and adaptation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (feather perception, puzzle as fragmented knowledge) create strong symbolic framework; emotional resonance remains surface-level due to minimal character interiority or conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Anthology-ready premise with original conceits; occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing ("acidic droplets a constant reminder") but avoids genre tropes through tactile specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Assigned elements cohere thematically but often function as explicit symbols rather than organic story components; the puzzle box and feather create narrative momentum that transcends checklist compliance.</comment>
