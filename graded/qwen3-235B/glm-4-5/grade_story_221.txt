<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya’s heritage as a ghost whisperer is underutilized; her emotional journey is clear but lacks nuance in connecting her psychic abilities to her decision-making. The mermaid ancestor myth feels tacked on rather than organically influencing her choice. Her voice is lyrical but generic, blurring individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tight structure for a short piece, but the shift from hesitation to acceptance feels abrupt. The amber’s activation of spirits is logical but underexplored. Pacing leans on poetic brevity, sacrificing deeper exploration of her internal conflict. The ending resolves the arc but lacks a satisfying climactic beat.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The decaying carnival evokes a haunting atmosphere. The amber’s light/shadow interplay and the shooting gallery’s transformation into a sanctuary are striking. Sensory details are vivid but uneven—more tactile or auditory elements could amplify immersion. Timeframe (letter) adds introspection but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic depth (rebellion, heritage, self-acceptance) is strong. The imagery (thawing ice, pulsing amber) and metaphor of "stepping into light" resonate emotionally. Subtext about inherited identity vs. autonomy is implied but could be sharpened. Avoids melodrama, favoring quiet introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-writing red flags, but the mermaid lore edges toward trope-heavy territory. The tone is consistent, with fresh metaphors (e.g., "current of purpose"). Some phrases ("heart thawing") verge on cliché. Emotional resonance is hinted at but leans on poetic abstraction rather than visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively but sometimes superficially; the amber ties the narrative together, while the ghost whisperer role feels extraneous. The brevity works thematically but sacrifices deeper exploration. The ending’s emotional payoff is clear but not transformative.</comment>
