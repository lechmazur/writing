<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation and conflict are present but underdeveloped; the blend of cybernetic and emotional traits lacks nuance, making the cyber-templar feel more like an archetype than a fully realized individual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within the constraints, but pacing feels rushed in moments critical to character resolution; cause-effect between character actions and outcome is logical, though the tight word limit compresses emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting creates a haunting, mythic atmosphere, but sensory details are abstract and repetitive, relying on vague descriptors like "pulsing energy" instead of vivid, specific imagery that fully immerses the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (light as truth, lightning as revelation) are impactful, but the poetic tone occasionally veers into overwritten abstractions; the ending’s thematic resonance is clear but undercut by heavy-handed exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Blends cyberpunk and mysticism, but phrases like "whirlwind of euphoric agitation" and "refracted spectrum of possibilities" lean on melodramatic tropes; emotional nuance is often stated rather than shown, and the prism/light method borders on over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are woven into the plot but often feel like checklist items rather than organic components; the story’s ambition exceeds its ability to balance all assigned elements cohesively within the word limit, leaving some underexplored.</comment>
