<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Underdeveloped inner complexity beyond surface traits; motivation is clear but predictable. Some emotional depth shown in final confrontation, but character voice lacks distinctiveness or nuance. Actions align with motivation but lack idiosyncratic choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Linear progression works within constraints; cause-effect clear but resolution feels rushed. The amber's discovery drives plot but ritual execution telescopes emotional arc. Strong beginning-middle flow, ending lacks follow-through on revelations shown. Pacing mostly controlled but falters in vision sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct visual texture through shattered glass/spider imagery and fading light. Atmosphere mirrors character's psychological state (crumbling sanctuary filled with artistic remnants vs. broken self). Sensory details (glowing amber, trembling hands) enhance immersion but worldbuilding remains localized rather than thematic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Echoes/symbolism (spider in amber=trapped memories) create conceptual unity. Ending provides closure but lacks narrative surprise. Writing style shows through evocative descriptions but overrelies on tremors/shadows motifs. Minor telling in explicit emotional declarations dilutes impact. Theme of authentic self-confrontation emerges clearly but simplistically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Familiar redemption-through-magic-artifact structure with few subversions. Repetition of "improbable" feels gimmicky; emotional responses remain on surface despite effective setup. The cathedral-artists juxtaposition shows invention but isn't fully exploited thematically. Sensory specifics are vivid but occasionally slip into generic decay descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Solid cohesion despite uneven element integration. Setting/amber relationship works but rumor framework feels artificial. Style occasionally sacrifices precision for poetic density. Compression is skillful but thematic possibilities remain under-harvested. Resonance exists but doesn't linger beyond surface catharsis.</comment>
