<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's phobia-ridden nature informs his actions but lacks psychological depth; motivations are explicit but introspection feels cursory, undermining emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to triumph, but pacing feels uneven; garage sales as exposition slows momentum despite their narrative necessity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting oscillates between vivid desert/library imagery and vague "mundanely spiritual" contrasts; sensory details immerse but thematic integration of environment is inconsistent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in merging stunt double profession with pyramid quest; occasional purple prose ("edge of madness") and predictable emotional beats prevent full marks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively utilized but not indispensable; story works within its constraints but lacks transformative ideas that would elevate it to masterwork status.</comment>
