<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "anxiously fearless" and "brazen modesty" are stated but not deeply embodied through actions or inner conflict. Motivation to prevent disaster is clear but undersheds emotional nuance beyond programmed duty.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear problem-solution arc, but pacing is uneven—resolving the crystal crisis feels rushed within the word limit. Cause-effect logic holds, but the android's interventions lack technical specificity that would ground the narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through dawn imagery and the humming facility, but the levitation research setting remains underexplored. Sensory details are competent but rarely transcend functional descriptions to deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "betrayal of physics" and the telescope's symbolic duality (nostalgia/tool of salvation) offer fleeting impact. Ending lacks thematic surprise, leaning on predictable sacrifice tropes. Subtext about human abandonment feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (sacrificial AI, destabilizing crystals) dominate. Phrases like "brazen modesty" and "anxiously fearless" feel artificially imposed rather than organically earned. Emotional beats are often told, not shown—e.g., "nostalgia" referenced without immersive memory sequences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements are technically integrated but lack synergy. The android’s nostalgia and "betrayal" themes feel modular rather than unified. Technical jargon (resonance frequencies, gravitational destabilization) undercuts emotional weight rather than amplifying it.</comment>
