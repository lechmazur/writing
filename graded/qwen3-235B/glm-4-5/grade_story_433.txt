<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (seeking solace, resisting failure) and aligns with actions, but the protagonist remains archetypal rather than fully individuated, with interiority conveyed through abstraction rather than specific behaviors or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The snowbound timeframe and ritual create narrative momentum, though the transformation of the gallery into a grove lacks transitional logic. The trajectory from brokenness to wisdom provides arc completeness within constraints, but pivotal moments feel compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystalline descriptions of shifting frosted glass and melting art create vivid atmosphere. The ephemeral setting mirrors the theme of transient power, though the liminal grove's connection to the gallery's premise remains underdefined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like "power as warmth rather than force" offer thematic resonance. While emotional beats are poetically rendered, the moral revelation feels familiar rather than freshly earned through action, leaning on assertion over demonstration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Despite immersive sensory details, the narrative occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction ("demure audacity," "scars of their past") that obscures psychological nuance. Tropes like "price of power" are revisited but not reinvented.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story coherently unites its elements into a mythic parable with satisfying thematic symmetry. While the brevity aids focus on the protagonist's transformation, the ending's wisdom risks facile resolution of complex themes.</comment>
