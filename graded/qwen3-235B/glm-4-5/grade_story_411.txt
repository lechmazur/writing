<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's mechanical identity lacks integration with his quest; motivations feel abstract rather than embodied in his actions or mechanical traits. Emotional responses (tearing up) inadequately reconcile with synthetic nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragment-reassembly as plot device strains logic but maintains cohesion; beginning/end connection exists but relies on metaphorical rather than structural progression. Pacing unevenly stretches/empresses time without clear narrative justification.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive but unbalanced - overrelies on sight while neglecting other senses; setting's surreal elements create atmosphere but insufficiently interact with character or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and layered imagery elevate thematic depth, but emotional impact diluted by telling rather than showing vulnerability; ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original setting concepts undercut by repetitive "repulsively attractive" phrasing and occasionally ornate description; emotional beats stated overtly rather than emerging organically through mechanical/human paradoxs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Compelling imagery and theme cannot fully mask forced elemental integration; structure demonstrates ambition but sacrifices narrative momentum and character logic for abstract symbolism.</comment>
