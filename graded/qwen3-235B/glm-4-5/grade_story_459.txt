<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's unique traits (supernatural sight, grief, elegance in clumsiness) are established with emotional nuance, but motivation feels slightly underexplored beyond generalized longing for peace</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion through recurring rituals and symbolic objects, but lacks significant complications or revelations within the constrained word limit to fully develop narrative arc</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully blends tactile sand castle details with ghostly ambiguity, though the surreal lab setting occasionally strains credibility as functional environment</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid imagery (sand turrets as silent witnesses, shimmering flower crown) creates resonance. The "haunted heart" metaphor elegantly bridges emotional and supernatural realms, though some descriptions verge on poetic excess</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Despite skillful integration of assigned elements, story feels like opening chapter rather than self-contained piece. Lingering emotional impact emerges from character interiority rather than narrative events</comment>
