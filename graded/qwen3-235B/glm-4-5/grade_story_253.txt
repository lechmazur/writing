<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits (polite bandit, eloquent silence, proud humility) are mostly stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Motivation for time mastery lacks psychological depth, feeling more like a plot device than organic desire.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act progression fits the word limit, but the transformation through the harp feels abrupt. The classroom memory motif provides circularity but lacks narrative tension. Causes/effects of time manipulation are vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting blends sci-fi and mythic tones, but electronic wilderness remains superficial. The harp's significance is asserted rather than earned atmospherically. Sensory details (glowing circuits, distorted notes) are sparse and abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (harp as fractured time, hobble-to-grace) add thematic cohesion. Ending achieves catharsis through symbolic imagery, though emotional impact is diluted by abstract narration rather than grounded action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Repetitive use of 'hush,' 'distorted notes,' and 'proud humility' borders on formulaic. Overwrought phrasing ("eloquently silent" juxtaposed with silence) feels performative. Emotional subtext is often labeled rather than shown through specific choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mechanical integration of elements (chip, harp, refuge) feels obligatory. Some symbolic resonance exists, but the story prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative clarity. The ending's thematic weight is undercut by vagueness.</comment>
