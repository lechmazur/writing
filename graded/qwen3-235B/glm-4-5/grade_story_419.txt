<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Presentation of empathic sensitivity is clear but lacks depth in reconciling physical craft with supernatural perception. Motivation to "honor legacy" remains abstract rather than demonstrated through tangible character history. The blacksmith's actions align with stated traits, but her internal conflict between no-nonsense practicality and emotional sensitivity remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a repair-as-restoration arc with satisfying resolution, but relies heavily on passive descriptions over active progression. The action of fixing the ornament drives the narrative minimally due to limited external obstacles or internal stakes. Pacing feels compressed, with the haunting elements more atmospheric than integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eerie Victorian dollhouse museum creates a strong visual and emotional tone through precise descriptions of miniature spaces and sensory details like "sighing" dollhouses. The post-human framework is established but underutilized—the dollhouses’ active watching undermines rather than enhances the haunting atmosphere. Setting serves the melancholic tone better than the plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story creates emotional resonance through the heartbeat synchronization metaphor and illumination of historical memory. The symbolism of a glowing ornament reviving collective grief shows craft, but lacks layered meaning beyond sentimentalism. Ending satisfies thematic goals without subverting genre expectations. "Heart still beats" theme is conveyed but not deepened through narrative techniques.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in blending blacksmithing with hauntology, but the "sighing dollhouse" conceit and "exhale" resolution verge on cliché. Some generic descriptors ("profound sorrow," "delicate process") weaken impact. The empathic connection through heartbeat borders on mystical abstraction rather than unique exploration. Emotional nuance is stated more than shown through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Story maintains cohesion but prioritizes conceptual symmetry over narrative rigor. Assigned elements form a thematic necklace rather than an integrated organism—particularly the overly symbolic heartbeat method and "steadily free" phrasing. The ending lingers emotionally, but the miniature scale of objects contrasts unevenly with grand metaphysical claims.</comment>
