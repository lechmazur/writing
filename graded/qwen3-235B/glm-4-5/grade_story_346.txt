<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract symbol rather than fully realized; motivations are stated indirectly but lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but feels compressed; cause-effect logic between soliloquies and escape requires more narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid but disconnected from character stakes; bioluminescent honeycomb and wasp nest juxtapose poorly with metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sophisticated metaphors (lint-as-map, sound-as-rhythm) exist, but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral; lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Contains striking phrases but suffers from rhythmic monotony; "precise madness" tone is inconsistently maintained amid abstract transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements like balloon pops and wasp nest feel arbitrarily chosen; thematic integration is ambitious but unevenly executed within constraints.</comment>
