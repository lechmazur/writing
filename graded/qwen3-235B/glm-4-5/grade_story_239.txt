<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains largely symbolic, with clear motivation but shallow psychological depth; gestures and actions vaguely signal defiance, but lack emotional complexity or humanizing details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Predictable structure (setup-performance-outcome) executed with clarity; pacing flows logically within word constraints but resolution feels abrupt, lacking escalation in stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gorgeous but static imagery (glowing rings, moonlit room) without deeper ecological, temporal, or metaphysical integration of the tree-related setting into character or plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Powerful thematic resonance in countering historical erasure through art; overly abstract prose often substitutes metaphorical flourish for concrete emotional engagement with moral consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyrical but occasionally hollow descriptors (radiant shifts, labyrinth of time) occasionally veer into self-conscious poetics; originality in memory-as-magic but diluted by archetypal character tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere metaphorically but lack visceral impact; short form feels economically used rather than artistically essential, with potential for deeper exploration of silence/erasure.</comment>
