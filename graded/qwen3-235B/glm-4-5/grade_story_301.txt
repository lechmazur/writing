<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Personality doesn't organically influence methods or reactions. No distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through repetitive actions without clear tension or stakes. Structure is circular, feeling incomplete due to lack of consequences. Cryptic symbols drive the plot but lack emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory details create evocative jazz age ambiance. Atmospheric coherence outweighs narrative logic. Setting serves as mood rather than functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some vivid metaphors (e.g., "tingling sensation" of cosmic wonder) but lacks emotional resonance. The ending feels inert rather than transcendent. Theme of reality manipulation remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Blends cosmic horror with domestic objects in an original way. Avoids genre clich√©s but relies on excessive adjectives ("numb fascination," "ethically questionable") that border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent execution of surreal premise, but lacks urgency or thematic depth. Cohesive in design while feeling intellectually hollow beneath its ornate surface.</comment>
