<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character development is minimal; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through actions. The "aggressively kind" attribute lacks concrete behavioral evidence, and the observer's intangibility weakens their psychological depth or narrative resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but constrained by the word limit. The whale's call as a temporal trigger feels arbitrary, but the resolution aligns with the premise. Pacing is uneven, with some elements (e.g., the dancer's performance) underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse establishes mood effectively with sensory details like "whispers" and "stormy sea," but the setting's symbolic potential (e.g., erosion vs. preservation) is underexplored. Atmosphere often relies on vague phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom") rather than vivid, specific imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts to evoke themes of cultural preservation through symbolism (whistle, whale) and subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. The ending feels abrupt rather than resonant, and the central metaphor lacks fully realized emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story leans on Gothic tropes (haunted lighthouses, spectral observers) without adding fresh subversion. Prose is overly ornate ("brazen calm," "captured spirit") without sufficient psychological or contextual grounding. Emotional beats are stated rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements feel imposed rather than organically integrated. The dancer’s storyline is too underdeveloped to create cohesion. While the whistle-as-artifact conceit is intriguing, the story’s ambition to merge mysticism and modernity falters under its own abstraction.</comment>
