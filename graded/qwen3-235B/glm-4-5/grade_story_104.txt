<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's stoic demeanor is well-established but motivation to suddenly break free feels underdeveloped. Internal conflict is stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful action. The cameo's symbolic importance is mentioned but not viscerally felt through lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory from museum closure to rebellion, but the emotional weight of the package's contents lacks sufficient buildup. Time limitations prevent full exploration of the steward's pivotal decision. Cause-effect logic holds but feels compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Miniature museum setting contains vivid visual details but other elements like the orchard gate feel disconnected. Sensory immersion limited to sight/touch; atmospheric sounds and textures from mechanical miniatures remain underexploited. "Cynical warmth" manifests inconsistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective bookending with miniature perfection versus human imperfection creates thematic resonance. Symbolism of the cameo and crack motif works well. Emotional beats lean on descriptive statements rather than subtext, reducing overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains recognizable melancholic archetypes. Some phrases border on ornate ("lullaby of conformity"). Motivation reads logically consistent but misses nuanced human contradictions. The steward's transformation lacks visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but several assigned elements function as window dressing rather than narrative drivers. The miniature museum concept is well utilized; the orchard framing and encrypted shipping add conceptual friction rather than narrative fuel. Memorable for concept over execution.</comment>
