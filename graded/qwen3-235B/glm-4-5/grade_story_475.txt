<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains a cryptic symbol rather than a psychologically plausible figure; motivations are implied through poetic abstraction but lack intimate human complexity or emotional grounding</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular structure (beginning and ending with dissolution/escape) creates coherence but sacrifices narrative momentum; key actions feel mystically inevitable rather than logically earned</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hyper-sensory details about light, texture, and decay create visceral immersion; however, the circus setting's thematic resonance with performance/delusion is underexplored</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality in blending brewing with temporal manipulation; struggles with balancing lyrical prose against functional narrative clarity; metaphors occasionally overshadow character agency</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion achieved through recurring motifs; emotional resonance limited by archetypal rather than psychologically specific character engagement</comment>
