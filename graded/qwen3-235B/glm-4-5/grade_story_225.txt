<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly developed; the apothecary's exile is stated rather than demonstrated, and the alliance with the officer emerges abruptly without psychological nuance or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; the Morse code transmission drives action yet resolves too quickly, with the butterfly-treaty connection underexplored within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting blends steampunk and war imagery effectively but relies on genre clichés ("scattered diamonds" sunlight, "wounded animal" pipes); sensory details overwhelm coherence at times.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Symbolism of butterflies as peace metaphors is clever, but subtext remains superficial; tone shifts between poetic and didactic without fully integrating both modes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conceptually inventive but execution wavers; the highlighter pen’s dual purpose feels contrived, and phrases like "battered marvel" verge on mechanical repetition seen in algorithmic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements force-fit into a moralized arc; ambitious theme clashes with underdeveloped execution, leaving a disjointed impression despite lyrical language.</comment>
