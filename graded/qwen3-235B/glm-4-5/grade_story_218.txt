<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually rich but lack psychological depth; motivation is clear but the emotional evolution feels accelerated, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but suffers from forced pacing around key meetings; the improv show encounter and sudden carnival appearances strain plausibility despite thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (ink-stained hands, shifting clock tower) establishes eerie atmosphere, but sensory immersion remains sporadic rather than fully enveloping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (games as emotional architecture) and lyrical prose create lasting resonance; resolution relies slightly heavily on sentimental closure rather than earned emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dual metaphysical/physical aspects and carnival liminality show inventiveness; some descriptions of isolation and connection verge on familiar existential tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Creative core exists beneath slightly mechanical narrative structuring; elements combine into a thematically consistent whole but lack the transcendent originality required for top-tier literature.</comment>
