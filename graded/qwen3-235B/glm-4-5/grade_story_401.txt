<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's wilderness guide identity lacks deep integration with central motivations; emotional arc of inherited guilt is compelling but relies heavily on expository revelation rather than psychological nuance; "guiltily innocent" trait drives action but remains superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing strains credibility through rapid emotional transformations; cause-effect chain between decoding blanket and healing generations of guilt feels abbreviated; circular structure (coffee ritual framing) effective but resolution appears rushed within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marine decay imagery and cold-depth preservation create hauntingly coherent atmosphere; sensory details (coral-encrusted throne, shifting light) masterfully anchor fantastical elements in physical reality; setting actively shapes narrative possibilities rather than passively containing them.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Skillfully intertwines metaphorical layers (ring as burden/promise, blanket as map) but emotional resonance undermined by over-reliance on declarative statements about "healing generations" rather than fully dramatized transformation; ending's thematic weight feels somewhat overwritten.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through distinctive decoding mechanism; emotional progression shows nuance beyond formulaic redemption arcs; maintains tonal consistency despite fantastical elements; occasional phrasing ("manic clarity") risks abstraction over embodiment but rarely compromises authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Excessive thematic signposting ("scales of justice," "equalizing history") slightly undermines literary sophistication; core concept's emotional power shines through despite structural imperfections; leaves lingering questions about inherited trauma's universality rather than immediate narrative satisfaction.</comment>
