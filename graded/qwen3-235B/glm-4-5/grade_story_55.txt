<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ethereal descriptions substitute for actual character depth; motivations are implied through poetic abstraction rather than demonstrated through concrete choices or psychological consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Incident-free stasis dominates; the "race against time" device is entirely symbolic with no tangible stakes or consequences. No discernible narrative arc within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Holographic utopia imagery contrasts effectively with tactile keys, but the studio's purpose conflicts with a bard's analog preservation efforts. Atmosphere compensates for worldbuilding gaps.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overwhelm emotional authenticity; metaphors ("music flowed through air") are conceptually memorable but lack visceral impact. No sustained tension despite thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Dense metaphor clusters border on self-parody. Tropes of doomed artists and silent studios recur without subversion. Overwrought phrasing muffles genuine emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergize. The utopian setting feels arbitrarily chosen rather than thematically essential for craft preservation themes. Prose richness outweighs execution.</comment>
