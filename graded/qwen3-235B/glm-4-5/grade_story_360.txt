<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "meekness" contrasts necromantic heritage but remains underdeveloped; motivations for family redemption are clear but lack psychological nuance. The broken pen ties to legacy but isn't fully leveraged for emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows discovery arc cohesively, but the dew drop revelation feels abrupt despite earlier sensory groundwork. Pacing balances description and action within constraints, though thematic resolution could be more earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Goblin city's bioluminescent fungi and playground sounds create strong atmospheric contrast. Sensory details like "glowing mushrooms" and stone-throwing games immerse but some worldbuilding elements remain unexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Symbolism of water-refracted light revealing interconnectedness is effective, as is weaving themes of mortality/light balance. However, emotional impact is slightly dulled by heavy thematic signposting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subverts necromancer trope through meekness/childlike wonder rather than violence. Some phrases overreach ("peculiarly sincere wonder") but the core conceit of using dew reflections instead of magic shows ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral beauty of the dew-drop insight and goblin-child contrasts leave lingering resonance. Assignments like "tone = mystic simplicity" are occasionally shoehorned, but the story maintains cohesion.</comment>
