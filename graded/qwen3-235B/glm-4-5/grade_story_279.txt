<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits like 'tactically reckless' are stated but not deeply demonstrated; motivations for her climate mission remain underexplored; actions align with plot demands more than organic behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a repetitive structure of footage comparison leading to revelation, but lacks rising tension; beginning/end connection exists via her mission arc, yet middle drags with redundant actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting's surreal 'giant's book' clashes tonally with climate focus; 'electric peace' is an intriguing but vague mood descriptor; sensory details are sporadic and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Attempted metaphors (e.g., 'path of gradience') feel vague; emotional impact is muted by heavy exposition; ending lacks resonance beyond plot resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Uninspired handling of 'rebel lone scientist' trope; over-reliance on abstract phrasing ('electric peace') weakens immersion; thematic depth leans on stated ideas rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Ambition is clear, but execution falls short in character/setting synthesis; strengths (conceptual premise) are undercut by inconsistent tone and shallow emotional stakes.</comment>
