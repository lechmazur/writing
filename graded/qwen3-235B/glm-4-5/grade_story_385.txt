<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's "pleasant meddler" trait underdeveloped; manipulative nature inconsistently tied to actions. Motivation to decode symbols lacks emotional depth despite clear ties to assigned concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing uneven but achieves narrative closure via skates-as-ritual solution. Assigned action/method logic requires suspension of disbelief; cause-effect connections between symbols, skates, and footprints feel contrived despite surface coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Hospital/skyscraper atmosphere sterile and dissonant with rusted object. Sensory details exist but remain superficial; beach symbolism feels tacked onto clinical setting rather than organically integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery ("pulse of obsidian walls") contrasts with vague thematic resonance. Climactic epiphany about skates-as-tools lacks emotional payoff despite clever metaphor use; tension remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√®-horror tropes but employs recognizable "mysterious markings" framework. Writing style precise but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction. Character reasoning logical without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>
