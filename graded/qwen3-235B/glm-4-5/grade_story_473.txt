<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Arc exists but unfolds too passively, relying on thematic weight rather than dramatized conflict; the beginning and end echo but lack cause-effect momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</comment><comment>Story possesses striking imagery and thematic ambition but struggles to fully integrate all elements into a unified narrative; concept over execution.</comment>
