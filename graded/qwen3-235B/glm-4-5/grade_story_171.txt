<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arthur's stamp collecting ties to his obsession with preserving the past, but his emotional journey is more implied than explored. His motivation to find magic is clear, but his connection to the fading sign lacks deep integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed in key moments (e.g., sudden shift to teary nostalgia during the tape). The ending feels forced—a childlike lesson about "seeing magic" undercuts the eerie atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered: the bicycle-powered carnival and faded orchard evoke a liminal space. Sensory details (e.g., "haunting notes of the concert") immerse the reader, though the setting occasionally tips into whimsical caricature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (garnet in dust, blank luggage tag) are effective but oversimplified. The story succeeds in "showing" Arthur's emotional connection to stamps, yet its message about magic as ordinary wonder borders on didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Ravenously gentle" and "bold vulnerability" ring formulaic. The bicycle-powered carnival leans on quirky tropes without subverting them. Emotional beats ("tears," "transported back") rely on familiar sentimental shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is thin: the carnival’s bicycle tech and faded sign feel stylistically at odds. The final message is simplistic, but the interplay of stamps, memory, and magic offers subtle thematic unity. Would benefit from deeper ambiguity.</comment>
