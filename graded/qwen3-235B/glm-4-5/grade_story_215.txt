<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prioritizes external conflict over deep psychological insight; characters function more as narrative tools than fully-realized beings despite intriguing traits like 'inwardly social' exorcist juxtaposition; dialogue showcases verbal sparring but lacks emotional complexity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on compressed exposition to convey puzzle progression; while dance-driven climax shows promise, the rushed execution of multi-locational puzzles undermines structural integrity; thematic payoff outweighs narrative coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Psychic research facility setting remains underutilized backdrop; attempts to blend academic and supernatural elements lack sensory specificity; 'crowded dance floor' lacks distinct spatial characteristics beyond plot utility</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Displays technical competence but lacks stylistic distinctiveness; clever dialogue exchanges compensate somewhat for thematic heavy-handedness; theme of science/spirituality synthesis introduced too late to achieve full resonance</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Newcomb-esque synthesis present in concept but not execution; genre-hybrid premise promising but execution relies too heavily on 'mysterious artifacts' and 'hidden rooms' tropes; emotional beats often told rather than shown through refined character behavior</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Demonstrates creative ambition in forced thematic element combination but sacrifices character depth and pacing precision; while conceptually intriguing, execution lacks the polish necessary for elite literary status; feels more like proof-of-concept than complete artistic statement</comment>
