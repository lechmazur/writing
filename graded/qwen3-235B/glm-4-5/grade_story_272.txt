<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character traits inform some actions but remain surface-level; motivation is clear yet abstractly rendered, while reactions to objects feel symbolic rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear arc but relies on underexplained mechanics; the method of using a whistle to decode data lacks logical consistency, undermining narrative cohesion within the constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative details (neon lights, cold coffee) but fails to integrate the digital archive's surreal logic with the diner setting, diluting the storyâ€™s tonal unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "tree of regret" gesture at thematic depth but lean on abstraction over emotional immediacy; the ending resolves mechanically rather than resonantly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blends tech and mysticism with some originality, but excessive metaphorical abstraction and formulaic "lonely inventor" tropes undermine authenticity, leaning on familiar beats without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story holds together mechanically through its assigned elements but struggles to balance brevity with thematic complexity, leaving some connections underdeveloped.</comment>
