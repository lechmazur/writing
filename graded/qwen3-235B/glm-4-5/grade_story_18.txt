<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Statue's motivation (truth-seeking) is clear but static; tragic joy is stated more than shown. The hair tie connects to backstory but lacks deeper integration with overall agency or character evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence through atmospheric progression, but the resolution with the artist feels rushed without sufficient build-up. Assigned elements shape direction but lack tight interconnectivity for a complete arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (steam, smog, flickering lamps) create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Integration of setting with theme is strong, though some descriptors risk veering into gothic clich√© without deeper thematic grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolic interplay (statue's duality, lies vs. truth) elevate impact. Emotional resonance relies heavily on atmospheric telling rather than nuanced "showing" of transformation; ending is poignant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere and concept are original but undercut by occasional purple prose ("gloomy cheerfulness") and overly ornate phrasing. The calligraphy method feels extrinsic, and emotional beats lean on familiar tropes (e.g., misunderstood art) rather than subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements like the hair tie and telepathy are woven into the core, but mechanical integration (e.g., calligraphy) feels imposed. The ending introduces thematic weight abruptly, leaving cohesion uneven despite a memorable central conceit.</comment>
