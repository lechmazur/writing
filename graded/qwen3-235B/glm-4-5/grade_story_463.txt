<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to eroding promises and dance are plausible, but the sentinel's "dry wit" remains superficial. Emotional stakes feel underdeveloped despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc and resolution within constraints, but the transition to the dance feels abrupt without prior setup. Pacing mostly controlled but occasionally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere is effectively rendered through tactile details (frayed rope, eroded coastline) and ghostly visuals. The lighthouse's history permeates every interaction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (rope as eroded vows, dance as preserved memory) elevate the narrative. Subtext about preservation vs. progress resonates emotionally, though occasional vague phrasing ("reckless precision") weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original in conceptualizing grief through dance and eroded promises, but some descriptive phrases ("translucent form performing first steps") verge on Gothic clich√©s. Emotional nuances occasionally veer toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coalesces around memory's persistence, but reliance on predetermined elements (dance, haunted lighthouse) creates friction between atmospheric needs and narrative focus.</comment>
