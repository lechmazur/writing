<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits (bookishness, geographically challenged mind) are conceptually tied to actions but underexplored. Motivation for revolution feels stated rather than organically demonstrated. The key cover's emotional influence lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise and conclusion align logically, but the word limit strains development of the climax's emotional weight. The key cover's activation of the system feels rushed despite clear cause-effect mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague tech-dystopia motifs. Frequency manipulation lacks sensory specificity; the sterile monitoring station fails to evoke oppressive control. Mournful elation is hinted through repetition rather than immersive detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Echoes of Kafkaesque dread and redemption through sacrifice create thematic resonance. Imagery of oppressive frequency control contrasts effectively with liberation metaphors. Ending avoids neat resolution, but emotional impact relies partially on telling rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality falters with "bookish assassin" as clich√©-meets-exotic trope. The geographically challenged "gift" feels contrived. Sensory details border on generic, but the blending of meditation and technological violence offers fresh thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but lack symbolic cohesion. The brevity works for tension but sacrifices emotional nuance. The open-ended termination of the old order invites reflection but feels undercontextualized.</comment>
