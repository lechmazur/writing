<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity beyond symbolic functions; motivations are clear but psychologically shallow. The paradox of being "independently dependent" is more poetic concept than lived reality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a ritualistic arc but lacks dramatic tension and payoff. The transformation occurs without resistance or consequence, weakening narrative momentum within the limited space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival and surreal visions create evocative atmosphere with strong sensory elements. Setting and tone work together to establish emotional resonance beyond decorative function.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Repetitive dreamlike descriptions and poetic abstractions often feel like ornamental scaffolding rather than organically developed elements. Tropes like "whispers of futures" feel clich√©d rather than innovative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><comment>Story maintains coherence but lacks narrative urgency or thematic weight beyond its own poetic surface. The experimental elements serve atmosphere better than meaningful storytelling.</comment>
