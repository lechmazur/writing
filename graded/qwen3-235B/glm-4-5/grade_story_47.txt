<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, but lacks depth beyond the assigned traits. The 'eagerly jaded' attribute is present but underexplored, and the ward’s emotional arc feels thinly rendered despite logical alignment with her role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is loosely coherent but suffers from compressed pacing and contrivances (e.g., stolen phones). The beginning/end connection is thematic but underdeveloped, and cause-effect logic (e.g., how she deciphers voice notes) is ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative through silence and symbolism (e.g., origami), but sensory detail diversity is limited. The "soundless sanctuary" contrasts effectively with emotional resonance, though some setting-character connections feel superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., glove as legacy/guide) and imagery elevates the theme. The ending’s emotional weight and layering of subtext (hope amid mortality) are impactful, though occasional "telling" weakens showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality is mixed: "reframing the familiar" is fresh, but "stolen phones" and "fearless laughter" lean on clichés. The prose avoids excess ornamentation but occasionally defaults to predictable phrasing (e.g., "graceless beauty").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates most elements, though some (voice notes) feel forced. The brevity serves thematic momentum, but the premise’s emotional weight isn’t fully earned due to thin character interiority.</comment>
