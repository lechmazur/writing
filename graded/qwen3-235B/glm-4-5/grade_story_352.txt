<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or emotional nuance; motivations are stated but not earned through lived experience or internal conflict. Traits like "feral" and "blithe discontent" remain abstract descriptors rather than lived behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows with dreamlike logic but lacks narrative momentum; circular structure feels intentional yet risks inertia. Clear connection between beginning/end, but pacing prioritizes atmosphere over forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create immersive atmosphere but struggle to cohere. The "feral" aspect of the character and the factory's mechanics remain vaguely connected to the broader mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor and paradoxical imagery ("ink that appears/disappears," "library of melodies") deepens thematic resonance. Subtext about ephemeral art vs. preservation lingers, though emotional connection remains distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids AI clich√©s with vivid originality in set pieces (e.g., impossible tree), but edges toward pretentiousness with excessive poetic abstraction. Some phrases lean on ornate vocabulary over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion but sacrifices emotional specificity. Brief length works against narrative stakes; thematic ambition exceeds the character/narrative depth achieved within constraints.</comment>
