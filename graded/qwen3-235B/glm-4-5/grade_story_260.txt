<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (gathering lost souls) is clear and consistent with his actions, but lacks depth beyond his singular dedication; minimal personal history or internal conflict weakens three-dimensionality despite symbolic ties to the brass key ring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical rhythm rather than a traditional arc, fitting the word limit but lacking progression; cause-effect (rewriting diaries ↔ souls finding peace) is logical, but the repetitive structure weakens narrative urgency or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, blending tactile details (clinking brass, pen scratches) and ethereal imagery (blue-glowing keys, whisper fragments) to create haunting mood; setting and timeframe amplify thematic isolation but verge on cliché ghost-story tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (crosswords as spiritual bridges, seeds of reconciliation spreading like vines) and symbolic objects deepen themes; poetic prose elevates impact, though emotional resonance is undercut by lack of plot-driven tension or character vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through specific, original mechanics (crosswords as healing tools) and subtextual depth, but occasional ornate phrasing ("noble chaos," "whisper fragments") risks veering into melodrama; emotional stakes lack visceral, nuanced grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story weaves assigned elements cohesively, but leans on atmospheric repetition rather than structural ambition; brevity feels constrained rather than deliberate, sacrificing lasting impact despite compelling central idea.</comment>
