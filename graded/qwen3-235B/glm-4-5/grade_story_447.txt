<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Achieved consistency in portraying Jenkins' defiance and clandestine influence, with her grandmother's stew and the ear's deterioration symbolizing her internal conflict. However, emotional depth remained surface-level, particularly regarding her brother's backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure was coherent with a meaningful arc from tool acquisition to burnout, but the 400-word format struggled to fully develop the transformation of Millfield beyond superficial neighborly reconciliations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory tapestry through olfactory (stew), tactile (thinning fur), and visual (glowing text) details created a lingering atmosphere where magical realism and domesticity collided thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism through ear-to-stew metaphors for impermanence and the satisfying paradox of using childhood remnants for adult responsibility elevated the narrative beyond mere magical realism tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoided most clich√©s through unique emotional stakes, though the magical ear device bordered on predictable. Avoided purple prose through restrained description of deteriorating objects as narrative mechanism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Successfully integrated assigned elements thematically but occasionally prioritized concept over character interiority. Left lingering questions about secrecy's costs but didn't fully explore them.</comment>
