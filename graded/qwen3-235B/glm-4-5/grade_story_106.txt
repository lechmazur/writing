<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's shift from sullen to hopeful is abrupt and underexplored; motivation to "erase boundaries" feels intellectually stated rather than emotionally lived; voice lacks distinct individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on mystical shimmering water as a narrative shortcut; the "method" of quilt patches is inconsistently applied; pacing alternates between overwritten exposition and underdeveloped transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich in isolated details (murky water, rusted machinery) but the setting's symbolic decay aligns thematically with the character's internal state; some sensory elements feel randomly chosen rather than purposefully curated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors are coherent but lack subversive depth; the theme of boundary-erasure resonates through quilting and stamps but leans on abstract philosophical language rather than visceral storytelling; ending feels intellectually tidy rather than emotionally earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive sentence structures ("clutching," "spreading," "imagining") hint at formulaic writing; stamp-collecting as a metaphor is original but psychologically undercontextualized; emotional shifts often told rather than demonstrated through organic action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but cohesively superficial; the brevity creates tension between thematic ambition and emotional underdevelopment; lacks the revelatory precision expected at the highest literary tier.</comment>
