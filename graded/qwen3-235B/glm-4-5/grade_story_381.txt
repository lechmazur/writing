<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivations tied to mentor and mapping are present but underdeveloped. Necromantic abilities remain disconnected from the primary task. No dialogue prevents voice distinction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists but feels low-stakes. Plot progression relies on static descriptions rather than dynamic tension. The mapping action drives the story, but the “hum of resolve” lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Effective sensory details about crystal light and sound create atmosphere, but holographic projectors and necromantic elements lack integration. “Futuristic nostalgia” is superficially rendered through sci-fi film references without deeper cultural or emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Imagery (pulsing lights, scuffed cap) creates mild emotional resonance, but themes of preserving magic and honoring mentorship remain underexplored. Lacks subtext or surprising metaphors; ending feels overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on familiar tropes (mentor’s relic, spirit communication, lone explorer). Some phrases (“eerie shadows,” “dazzling display”) border on generic. Emotional beats stated rather than shown, with predictable resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Convoluted synthesis of necromancy, sci-fi, and cinema references lacks cohesive logic. Elements exist side-by-side rather than interlocking—e.g., necromantic powers never intersect meaningfully with movie quotes or crystal magic. Unique concepts (e.g., holographic nostalgia) underexploited.</comment>
