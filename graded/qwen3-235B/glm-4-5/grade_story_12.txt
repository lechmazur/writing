<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Flat, underdeveloped transformation; motivations explained, not earned through actions. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite introspective premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rushed arc; plot pivots on implausible connection to tile. Kayaking metaphor derails structure. Resolution abrupt, disconnected from initial aloofness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Futuristic mall underrealized; sensory details perfunctory. Atmosphere inconsistent—merges sterile tech with mystical memory without tension or cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric framework (kayaking/mapping memory), but over-reliance on stated themes ("language of the soul") undermines subtext. Ending poetic but didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Formulaic transitions between ideas. Overly ornate abstractions ("ceramic matrix") clash with cardboard character beats. Clichéd metaphors (broken-whole duality) lack revelatory power.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially integrated but strain under scrutiny. Ambitious thematic layering (memory as geography) remains unfulfilled. Style occasionally memorable but often hollow.</comment>
