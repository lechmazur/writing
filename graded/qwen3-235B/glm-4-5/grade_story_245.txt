<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character displays consistent motivation through symbolic actions (chopstick, jogging), but emotions lean towards stated rather than nuanced revelation through action. Internal conflict lacks full visceral immersion despite strong thematic foundations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story follows a circular structure mirroring psychological stasis rather than dynamic arc. Tea-leaf revelation feels underdeveloped as narrative pivot point. Jogging motif effectively connects temporal progression but lacks concrete cause-effect mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from rust-regret taste imagery and graveyard metaphors, but futuristic elements remain superficially rendered. Sensory details like recycled air clouds lack distinct sci-fi resonance. Abandoned spaceport's potential as active environment unrealized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (baptismic waterfalls, tealeaf path) create thematic depth, but some devices (repeated "twisting sensation") become redundant. Ending's emotional impact diluted by persistent abstraction over embodied experience. "Memorialize" retains conceptual strength despite uneven execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tealeaf divination strains credibility in sci-fi context. Heart's revolt remains abstract trope rather than organically developed phenomenon. Overuse of adverbial qualifiers ("biting sincerity") detracts from visceral immediacy. Voice occasionally slips into poetic generalities over character-specific nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into melancholic whole, though several devices operate at surface level (spaceport as clich√©d purgatory). Thematic resonance around self-revelation through patterns shows promise, but emotional payoff remains intellectually suggestive rather than viscerally felt. Structurally cohesive within constraints.</comment>
