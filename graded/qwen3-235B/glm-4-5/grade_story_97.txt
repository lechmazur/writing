<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pure motivation clarity, but character's abstract nature and lack of tangible traits beyond "fact/emotion conflict" limit depth. Gestures toward individuality without full realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from quest to revelation, but rapid transformation feels underdeveloped. Pacing uneven – compressed emotional logic sacrifices narrative momentum during pivotal shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stylized descriptions ("shimmering reality") create atmosphere but rely heavily on abstract metaphors rather than concrete sensory engagement. Ethereal setting benefits from thematic cohesion but lacks tactile grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors work overtime with satisfying results – compass's inward turn, "cradle" timeframe. Emotional subtext emerges through symbolic objects rather than stated feelings. Theme crystallizes through metaphorical action rather than narrative substance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Earns originality points for emotional landscapes concept but occasionally relies on rhythmic repetition ("heartbreak-induced visions" echo diminishes impact). Nuanced tone balance between clinical ("fact-minded") and vulnerable prevents formulaic structures from solidifying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tightly woven core concept but sacrifices emotional weight for symbolic density. Assigned elements serve thematic functionality over visceral storytelling. Lingering resonance comes from metaphor's afterimage, not character's particularity.</comment>
