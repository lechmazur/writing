<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent motivation drives Finn’s actions, but emotional depth remains superficial. His internal conflict between doubt and destiny is hinted but not deeply explored through nuanced reactions to the notebook or encounters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc from searching to fulfilling destiny, but pacing feels rushed in key revelations. The method of "chance encounters" lacks tension and causal logic, undercutting coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blends decay and mysticism effectively through sensory details (artificial moonlight, petal patterns). The urban orchard’s atmosphere enhances the goddess’s absence and Finn’s obsession.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language (symbols mirroring constellations) and layered themes of legacy/loss elevate impact. The ending’s mystical transformation is resonant but slightly under-earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on “chosen one” tropes without fresh subversion. Occasional overuse of abstract phrases (“familiarly unknown”) and uneven emotional subtext mar originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive but uneven—some elements (notebook, fluctuations) integrate seamlessly; others (chance encounters) feel imposed. Lingering questions about dreams’ restoration offer thematic weight.</comment>
