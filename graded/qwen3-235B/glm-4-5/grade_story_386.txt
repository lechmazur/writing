<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weirdly archetypal character despite 'trustworthy strange' mandate; motivations stated more than demonstrated through specific actions; emotional complexity buried under ornate description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable time-travel arc with insufficient complication; catapult activation lacks tangible stakes despite lyrical prose; celestial alignment justification feels like hand-wavy time travel convention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric collision between atomic science and ancient tradition creates intriguing tension; specific sensory details (humming core, glowing thread) undercut by over-reliance on abstract descriptors like 'hush' and 'void'.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose creates haunting imagery ('bind old wounds with unstoppable will'), but lacks emotional ballast; ending feels more like narrative obligation than earned catharsis; theme of cultural resurrection remains surface-level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Originality undermined by AI-writing-signature phrases ('whisper of forgotten ages' cadence); 'embroidered tablecloth as time map' concept fresh but lost in repetitive adjectival thickets; emotional beats telegraphed rather than revealed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Competently fulfills assigned elements but never transcends prompt-checking; atomic lighthouse/tablecloth synergy initially intriguing but underdeveloped; word count exposes structural fragility despite lyrical passages.</comment>
