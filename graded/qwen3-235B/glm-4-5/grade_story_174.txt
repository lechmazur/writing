<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually coherent but lacks emotional depth; his regret drives the plot but feels underexplored beyond surface-level statements. Motivation and actions align, but internal conflict remains sketchy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but rushes resolution; the connection between frost patterns and the library’s revelation lacks visceral buildup. Pacing balances tight word count but leans on convenient narrative pivots.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly imagined (mist, frost, river-stone eyes), but the car in a waterfall-hidden library fractures immersion. Sensory details elevate setting, though structural incredulity lingers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (frost = cosmic instructions, leaves = memories) and thematic focus on impermanence resonate. Ending feels resolved but derivative; emotional impact hinges on symbolic layering over raw human tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story avoids outright clichés but embraces familiar mystical-revelation tropes. Frost-carving method is creative but strained by the car’s illogical presence. Language occasionally leans on overwrought phrasing (e.g., “language of patterns and possibilities”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Solid integration of assigned elements, but cohesion frays at edges (car in cave). Premise is intriguing, but emotional weight and narrative momentum are unevenly distributed. Style elevates material but can’t fully mask structural seams.</comment>
