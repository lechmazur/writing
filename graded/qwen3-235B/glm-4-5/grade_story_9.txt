<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lack of emotional depth; character exists primarily as a conduit for themes. Sarcastic voice feels performed rather than earned. Motivation for stewardship is stated more than dramatized through meaningful action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear progression of lock openings creates forward motion. Visions-as-plot-mechanism functional if conventional. Resolution feels premature rather than earned. Pacing loses some coherence during abrupt transitions between introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Neon desert setting contains rich potential but underdeveloped beyond aesthetic juxtaposition. Sensory details overly concentrated on visual elements at expense of other senses. Atmosphere and ecological themes only partially integrated into concrete reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strikes a delicate balance between poetic metaphor and environmental didacticism. The concept of distilled futures within water rings shows inventiveness. Ending lacks emotional resonance despite clever imagery. Theme dominates subtlety of craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Combines familiar archetypes (doomed prophet, ticking-clock artifacts) with some fresh environmental metaphors. Dialogue feels performative rather than organic. The "probably unlikely" motif lacks payoff. Occasional purple prose undermines otherwise striking imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on symbolic heavy lifting outweighs narrative cohesion. Elements feel arranged to fulfill requirements rather than organically developed for storytelling purposes. Lingering ambiguity about central conceit undermines deeper engagement.</comment>
