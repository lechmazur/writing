<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear through her rebellion against developers and preservationist focus, but her emotional complexity remains sketchy. The 'braided bitterness' and dialogue reveal surface-level defiance rather than multidimensional psychology. Actions align with motivation but lack authentic inner conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic save-the-building structure with the chamber's plans serving as resolution. The constantly shifting passage provides minor momentum, but the 400s-word arc feels compressed - key revelations about architectural genius and historical significance lack earned emotional weight. Transition to victory seems abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective initial atmosphere through weather motifs ("storm breathes," "cold drafts") and tactile details (rough stones, rain scent) create eerie tension. However, the "knowing" ancient elements feel derivative rather than truly menacing. The haunted passage concept remains underutilized as an active force rather than backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses architectural personification ("walls whispering secrets") and cyclical storm motifs to symbolize historical memory. Ending ties theme to physical preservation, but emotional impact diluted by overt exposition ("sincere rebellion had saved history"). The "braided bitterness" tone emerges inconsistently rather than permeates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overuse of passive phrasing ("was constantly changing," "had woven itself") weakens immediacy. Clich√©d descriptors ("ancient and knowing") and repetitive storm-weather motifs undercut originality. The "whispered family secrets" element feels procedurally included rather than organically developed, with minimal emotional nuance behind stated bitterness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack narrative synergy - "constantly changing" passage serves plot mechanics more than thematic depth. Story feels constrained by checklist rather than organically constructed - the storm framework and building tradition motivations exist in parallel rather than interlocking. The conclusion provides resolution but lacks lasting resonance.</comment>
