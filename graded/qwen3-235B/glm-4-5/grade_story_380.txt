<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aris's fragmented state and motivation are conceptually strong but lack specific emotional grounding; reactions to the album and dream theft gesture at depth without full exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear arc but feels rushed and underdeveloped in cause-effect logic; pivotal transitions (e.g., dream plunge) lack narrative momentum despite poetic framing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere is vividly conveyed through light/shadow and sensory decay, but the treehouse's connection to Aris's psyche remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and imagery elevate the prose, but character psychology and theme connection rely too heavily on "telling"; lacks layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid descriptions avoid overt AI patterns, but "quiet mania" and "fragmented self" lean on familiar literary tropes; emotional resolution feels conventionally sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Conceptual ambition is present but diluted by underdeveloped elements; the brevity works against full thematic realization rather than enhancing it through elegance.</comment>
