<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is stated but underdeveloped; internal shift feels abrupt rather than earned through action. Quietness serves more as aesthetic than meaningful trait influencing behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear structure relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatic progression; thematic cohesion between beginning and end exists, but lacks tangible plot mechanics to anchor the abstract revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere created through sparse but vivid details (bird calls, glass dome), but setting remains backdrop rather than active participant in the character's transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors and cosmic themes elevate the narrative; however, emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction and declarative statements about enlightenment rather than embodiment through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasional poetic flourishes counterbalanced by repetitive phrasing ("recovered memories," "universal language") and structural predictability in reincarnation trope execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic skeleton exists, but execution unevenly balances lyrical prose with underdeveloped conceits; memorable concept hindered by thin emotional mediation.</comment>
