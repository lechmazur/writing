<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's emotional conflict is present but underdeveloped; motivations tied to past relationships and survival lack psychological nuance. Indifference to danger feels inconsistently rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is loosely coherent but relies on vague connections (recipe’s effects, unresolved avalanche metaphor). Pacing unevenly balances character introspection with urgent action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but underused—neon and slums described superficially. Sensory details lack specificity to deepen mood or character stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance undercut by over-reliance on abstract metaphors. Ending attempts thematic closure but feels forced. Subtext about fate lacks grounding in character interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd spy romance tropes. Purple prose, generic descriptors, and abrupt thematic shifts suggest formulaic construction. Urban exploration’s role feels contrived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements feel compartmentalized rather than integrated. Narrative tension prioritizes concept over character logic. Ending’s “peace” lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>
