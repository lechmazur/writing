<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character exists as archetype rather than fully realized individual. Motivations implied but underdeveloped; inconsistent use of "commonly individual" weakens psychological coherence. Emotional responses often stated rather than dramatized through specific actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot remains static, relying on atmospheric tension rather than progression. Flame manipulation lacks narrative consequence; resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through causal chain. Pacing inconsistent - shifts between exposition and action without clear momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through vivid but imprecise details like humming fibers and impossible flame patterns. Booth exists as symbolic entity rather than lived-in space; sensory details present but unevenly weighted. Tone fluctuates between Gothic gravity and half-committed whimsy without clear narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery (flame's dance, trembling napkin) creates visual impact, but emotional resonance limited by heavy-handed exposition. Central conflict between guardian and supernatural force introduced but insufficiently dramatized through actions or irreversible stakes. Ends with unresolved tension rather than structural completion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Demonstrates AI writing tendencies: ornamental descriptions over specificity ("ancient fibers humming"), repetitive phrasing ("whispered confessions"), and overused metaphors (veil, sanctuary/prison). Attempts innovation with zero-gravity flame but executes through vague spectacle rather than narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements combine formally but not organically - feels composed through checklist assembly. While brevity serves circular structure, forced mysticism and undefined concepts (zero-gravity booth mechanics) suggest superficial engagement with premise. Lingering questions feel unintentional rather than provocative.</comment>
