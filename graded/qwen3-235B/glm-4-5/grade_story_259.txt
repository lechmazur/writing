<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Underdeveloped character outside of assigned traits; motivation to collect myths is clear but lacks personal stakes or emotional depth; telescope use is symbolic but doesn't meaningfully reveal character traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Static progression through a setting rather than a plot; accidental double-booking serves only as setup; lacks urgency or transformation; weak cause-effect chain within constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually vivid cybernetic plant with painted history creates compelling atmosphere; sensory details like machinery hum and telescope's symbolism enhance tone, though worker interactions remain superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (telescope as conduit/divine lens) and theme of spiritual-mechanical symbiosis add depth; evocative imagery but lacks emotional engagement; ending feels more like summary than impactful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by merging spirituality with hard sci-fi; metaphors specific (sacred circuitry, "digital souls") not generic; some lyrical passages risk preciousness but maintain narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</comment>Story coexists with elements rather than integrating them; atmospheric but meander-like; brief length exposes structural thinness beneath strong imagery; memorable concept without narrative rigor.</comment>
