<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (impossible promise) is clear but lacks psychological complexity; "mild curiosity" underdeveloped compared to obsessive determination shown; emotional reactions to revelations feel underexplored despite transformative premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but relies heavily on expository reveals through holograms; cause-effect between rain resonance and time reconstitution remains unconvincing; pacing condenses epic scope unevenly, creating tonal dissonance between intimate mourning and cosmic revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ship graveyard establishes haunting atmosphere through evocative decay imagery; rain motif effectively bridges temporal divide; cosmic intimacy conveyed through tactile descriptions of the ring box; lacks olfactory/gustatory details that could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonance metaphor creates profound thematic connections between memory and precipitation; ending's philosophical weight lingers; emotional impact undercut by overly abstract explanations of reality-bending artifacts; "showing" through holographic memories works strongest.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some overwritten abstractions ("cosmic intimacy") verge on purple prose; original use of rain-as-archival-memory stands out; avoids major AI-writing markers but occasionally substitutes concept depth for emotional specificity in character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain logical consistency; brevity serves the elegiac tone but limits thematic exploration; the central mechanism's metaphysical logic remains intriguingly ambiguous, sparking discussion about memory's endurance.</comment>
