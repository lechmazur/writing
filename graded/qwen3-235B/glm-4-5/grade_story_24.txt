<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is implied but not deeply explored; the dentures shape his voice but their symbolic weight feels underdeveloped. The "meandering" aspect lacks tangible influence on plot decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing inconsistencies; the action of sowing emotion drives the narrative well, but the timeframe reference to an apologetic text creates an artificial pause that doesn't fully integrate with the momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Detailed atmospheric elements like "fractured idyll" create strong visuals, but sensory details verge into overwritten territory. The mountainous bookstore's significance feels slightly overstated rather than organically felt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept of warmth vs. coldness resonates metaphorically. The puppet shows' emotional impact is shown rather than told, but the philosophical dentures concept lacks deeper exploration of human vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some phrases feel overly conceptual ("sow seeds of emotion"), but the core narrative approach remains distinctive. Avoids most AI commonalities but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction where specific actions would strengthen impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but some assigned elements feel like checklist items rather than narrative necessities. The apologetic text framing device particularly strains credibility as organic story structure.</comment>
