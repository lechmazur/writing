<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated but not fully embodied through specific actions; the transition from "aimless" to determined guardian lacks psychological depth or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is overly reliant on convenient discoveries (hopscotch code) with insufficient causality; the arc from wanderer to guardian feels narratively compressed and emotionally unearned despite high-concept premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on superficial sensory details ("snowflake melted") without sustained immersion; archive setting's connection to culinary heritage feels arbitrary rather than organically constructed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Some effective metaphors ("seeds of vigilance") undercut by excessive abstraction and emotive clich√©s ("mournful elation"); emotional impact is diluted through narrated rather than dramatized feeling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Predictable emotional beats and ornamental language ("factually imaginative") suggest formulaic construction; repetitive "snowflake melting" motif and underdeveloped subtext indicate AI-assisted composition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story attempts thematic coherence but struggles under element overload; the hopscotch discovery feels more like contrived plot device than organic revelation supporting its cultural preservation message.</comment>
