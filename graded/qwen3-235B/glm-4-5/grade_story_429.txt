<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with desire to preserve heritage, but internal conflicts and personality nuances remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a restorative arc but lacks narrative tension; transitions between actions are logical yet predictable, with "folding" timeframe creating conceptual confusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from vivid aurora imagery and sensory details of restoration process, but setting remains generic and temporal element ("folding") undermines coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative moments in audio resurrection resonate emotionally, but thematic reliance on "breaking chains" clich√©s and repetitive "hushed euphoria" phrasing weakens subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Excessive use of "crackles," "hushed euphoria," and sentimental closure suggests formulaic emotional cues; family recipe/spice scale concepts show potential but execution feels mechanically connected rather than organically discovered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through recurring motifs, but some elements (specifically "folding") strain plausibility; brief length obscures character history that would strengthen emotional stakes.</comment>
