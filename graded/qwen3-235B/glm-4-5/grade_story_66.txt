<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is emotionally abstract but lacks visceral depth; motivations are implied but not deeply earned through actions. The "deserter" label is more symbolic than humanized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on internal realizations over events; cohesion exists but pacing feels uneven. The resolution occurs abruptly without earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric with strong visual details but under-explored thematically; the plant communication study's scientific premise isn't fully integrated. Sensory immersion is partial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Highly effective metaphors (masks, mirror) and lyrical prose. The theme of fragmented identity is resonant, though emotional impact is softened by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uncommon imagery avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers toward self-conscious poetics. The concept of "carbonizing" thoughts is inventive but risks over-symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh narrative execution; the story leans heavily on poetic resonance over structural rigor. Conceptual ambition outpaces character and plot development.</comment>
