<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's duality as former human/watchman is intriguing but underexplored; motivations hinted at but lack depth; "forcibly gentle" touch shows inner conflict yet remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear patrols substitute plot progression; cyclical structure mirrors character's stagnation but weakens narrative momentum; vague connections between actions and emotional shifts impair coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visually immersive with vivid honeycomb/hexagon imagery but sensory details unevenly distributed; tone leans on "golden" aesthetic without deeper ecological or societal worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like "jubilant remorse" and ruler symbolism elevate text; lacks concrete stakes or tension; ending reiterates themes without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in bee-fingerprint system and human transformation but formulaic descriptions ("kaleidoscope," "whispers") and predictable melancholy undercut freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cohesive tone maintains eerie beauty, but forced integration of some elements (fingerprint method, timeframe) strains plausibility; thematic tension between freedom/entrapment resonates weakly.</comment>
