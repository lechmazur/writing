<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak motivation portrayal; jadedness feels superficial. Core actions align with quest for truth, but lacks emotional depth or nuanced personality development beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear structure with fireworks as temporal anchor, but the doodle-to-map method strains plausibility. Pacing uneven in middle, yet delivers resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crystal lab offers visual interest, but underexploited atmosphere. Sensory details minimal—fireworks provide basic temporal marker without enhancing mood cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Glowing crystals and inherited perception hint at deeper themes, but emotional impact diluted by explicit explanation rather than organic symbolism. Premise intriguing but insufficiently unpacked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystal-as-obsession avoids full cliché, but "optimistic desperation" feels imposed rather than earned. Doodle method borders on contrived logic. Language occasionally overdressed but not florid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outweighs execution. Elements combine inventively but lack thematic resonance. Ending raises questions without adequate payoff, leaving story feeling provisional.</comment>
