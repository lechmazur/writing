<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's telekinesis and motivation are clear but lack dimensional depth; assigned traits align with actions but insufficiently explore emotional or psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on abrupt transitions between visions and reality; climax feels truncated despite effective utilization of assigned elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Combines unique elements (telekinetic bookbinder, carnival ruins) with familiar tropes (price of knowledge); avoids algorithmic repetition but falls short of subverting conventions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weaves assigned components into a thematically cohesive whole, though some elements (timeframe, attribute) underdevelop originality or narrative necessity.</comment>
