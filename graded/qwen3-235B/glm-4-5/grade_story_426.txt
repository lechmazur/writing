<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (preservation of knowledge) is clear, but emotional depth remains surface-level despite symbolic parallels between his fractured career and the teapot. "Aloof passion" lacks nuanced behavioral evidence, relying on declarative descriptions rather than concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure shows purposeful arc from determination to triumph, but the hacking of "bizarre music playlists" strains credibility. The marathon training/resilience parallel works narratively but feels tangential to the central discovery method's artificial complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dust-filled air, flickering lights, and eerie soundscapes vividly establish a decaying liminal space. The cracked teapot's physicality and the Blackwood family's ghostly musical legacy deepen atmosphere, though touch/smell details remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (teapot/career, marathon endurance) succeed through measured symbolism over exposition. Emotional resonance emerges strongest in the teapot embrace, but the theme of "forgotten knowledge" relies heavily on established tropes rather than original thematic territory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>Originality shines in the audio frequency decryption concept and teapot's symbolic weight, but overuse of "haunted" clich√©s (recorded screams, "lingering in shadows") and predictable "prodigy-exile" archetype undermine fully subversive potential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but occasionally strained by element overload. The timeframe's connection to plot mechanics (marathon training enabling focus) works inventively, though the "angrily peaceful" tone inconsistently informs both narrative and character decisions.</comment>
