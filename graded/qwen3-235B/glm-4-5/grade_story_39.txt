<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack psychological depth; the "earnestly deceptive" trait feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but slightly rushed; the transition from discovery to salvation glosses over technical/emotional complexity, yet maintains coherence within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mars biodome atmosphere has vivid moments (e.g., "crystal lens pulsing") but underutilizes sensory specifics; bookshop setting feels disconnected from core action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective imagery ("sculpt a new tomorrow from ruin") and thematic resonance about preservation vs. innovation, but emotional beats often told rather than shown (e.g., "hope," "grim determination").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s; "ephemeral cameos" and "reverberating light" are inventive. Some phrases ("sculpted from ruin") verge on overused, but overall freshness remains strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transcendent synergy; the narrative fulfills its brief competently but doesn't surpass genre expectations for literary innovation.</comment>
