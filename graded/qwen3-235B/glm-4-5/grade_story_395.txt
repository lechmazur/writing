<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marshal's duty and rebellion feel externally assigned rather than organically integrated; emotional stakes of her heritage preservation lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on serendipitous timing (eclipse, festival) with coherent cause-effect, though alliance formation feels hastily telescoped without sufficient tension or relationship-building.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lush setting details (glowing petals, misty pools) create immersive atmosphere, but architectural logic of hidden library beneath spa strains credibility without foundational worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ethereal imagery and cyclical structure (ending with revived dance) convey poignancy; thematic depth about cultural preservation is explicit rather than subtly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose alternates between inventive metaphors ("hummed melodies") and formulaic descriptors ("shared experience at main stage"); some elements (fortune cookie, cloud spa) lean into fantastical absurdity without grounding subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>High-concept elements work cohesively but occasionally distract from emotional authenticity; final dance performance provides thematic payoff while leaving broader implications underexplored.</comment>
