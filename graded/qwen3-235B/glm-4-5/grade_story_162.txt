<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation (harmony in chaos) ties to the character's military past and island secret, but "uniquely trustworthy" lacks concrete demonstration. The gambler's carefree nature conflicts with his focused determination, weakening consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to revelation via videotape, but the 400-word compression leaves arc underdeveloped. Pacing drags on atmospheric introspection while the central action (unlocking the blueprint) remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Workshop's "half-finished projects" mirror the gambler's psyche effectively, but overreliance on "scent of salt, sun-baked sand" clichés dilutes the island's emotional weight. Tonal dissonance between noir grit and romantic nostalgia weakens cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (workshop as mind, gambler as deconstructor) show craftsmanship, but the ending's vague "free them all" lacks emotional punch. Subtext about trust and secrecy lingers, though surface-level tells ("turmoil in his heart") undercut subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some flowery transitions ("laughter of a woman who had once been his entire world") verge on melodrama. Tropes (romanticized military trauma, island secrets) go mostly unchallenged. Emotional beats feel telegraphed rather than naturally earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels mechanical—every assigned element is present but strained. The tight timeframe highlights underdeveloped emotional stakes. Conceptual ambition exceeds the execution's capacity for resonance.</comment>
