<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains emotionally static; "bitterly optimistic" and "reckless precision" are named rather than demonstrated through specific actions. Father's disappearance is underexplored motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong inciting incident but rushed resolution; convergence occurs too conveniently via the parking stub. Pacing mismanages tension between scientific theory and mythic transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid astronomical phenomena contrast weak terraforming of xenobiology station; atmospheric potential undercut by inconsistent engagement with the setting's scientific purpose. Sensory details prioritize spectacle over logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric stitching of realities has emotional resonance, but thematic weight collapses under abrupt transcendence. Prose oscillates between lyrical abstraction and plot-driven exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Derivative tropes (fractured realities, cosmic chosen ones) undermined by flashes of originality in stub-to-stars motif. Emotional responses often stated rather than embedded in action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements unevenly weighted; parking stub and migration of clouds essential while xenobiology station feels perfunctory. Ending sacrifices narrative closure for thematic grandeur.</comment>
