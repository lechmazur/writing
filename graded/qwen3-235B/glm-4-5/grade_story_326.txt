<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to defy genetic limits is clear but underdeveloped; reliance on symbolic objects over character actions to convey depth; "sweetly fierce" trait feels imposed rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent arc from failing magician to savior, but pacing stumbles under compressed word limit; key plot points (walkie-talkie success, genetic restoration) feel rushed or unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</comment>Setting is visually rich but emotionally flat; underground fairy city lacks immersive sensory logic; cosmic timeframe and fairy genetics conceptually clash rather than synergize.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (fan/DNA bridge) are conceptually bold but emotionally distant; ending's thematic message lands intellectually rather than viscerally; underdeveloped subtext about legacy vs. innovation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (e.g., "whirred to a halt," "cosmic possibility") border on self-parody; some originality in blending science (DNA) with fantasy but leans on familiar redemption arcs without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic synthesis of genetic identity and performative magic, but execution prioritizes concept over emotional resonance; strong core idea weakened by occasional narrative contrivance.</comment>
