<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; spiritedness defined through actions but lacks psychological depth or internal conflict to fully realize motivation beyond symbolic significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates cohesion but lacks narrative stakes; progression feels static, more vignette than structured arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ethereal grit conveyed through vivid sensory detail (neon, shadows) but urban setting beyond the shop remains thinly sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thematic resonance present, but emotional weight occasionally undercut by overt thematic exposition rather than subtextual development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in premise (DVD/neon as hope vectors), but character trope and formulaic defiance of cynicism undermine perceived ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but sacrifices character/personal stakes for poetic abstraction; lingers atmospherically but lacks narrative dimension.</comment>
