<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict development; her actions align with her traits but lack deeper emotional subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure with logical cause-effect, though pacing feels slightly rushed in key moments; the arc’s resolution is concise but could use more thematic payoff.</comment>
