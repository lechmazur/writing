<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is intriguingly enigmatic, but lacks emotional depth and psychological complexity. Motivation (price of war) is hinted at but insufficiently layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Narrative progression through physical metaphors is masterful. The flattery-as-ambition arc culminates in a viscerally satisfying resolution within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere with tactile contrasts (wooden bead/mirrored grotesquerie), but virtual calls element remains superficial despite comms unit integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stunning symbolic density (mirror/bead/ritualistic movement) with elegantly subtextual examination of perception vs reality. Ending delivers thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original metaphysical execution with minimal purple prose, though some over-reliance on visual metaphors risks aesthetic overload without emotional complement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Excellent character-method synthesis and theme delivery, but virtual calls element feels artificially inserted rather than organically essential to narrative architecture.</comment>
