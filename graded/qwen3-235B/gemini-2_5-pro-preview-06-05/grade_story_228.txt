<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's desperation to disprove self-doubt is clear but insufficiently explored; her herbalist identity remains more metaphor than lived reality; motivations are hinted rather than deeply embedded in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pivotal action (storm, plant regrowth) drives plot but feels rushed; cause-effect chain is logical but lacks tension development; beginning/end connection exists but feels abrupt within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dystopian bunker atmosphere established through sterile imagery but underutilized; sensory details about cold tech vs. warm relic show promise but need deeper integration; tone shifts inconsistently between clinical and poetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Subtext about healing through simplicity resonates powerfully; emotionally impactful ending with cessation of inner drumming; rich symbolism (clothespin/plant recovery) elevates impact; some emotional beats told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("desperate vine," "artificial tomb") are fresh but occasionally overwrought; avoids most tropes through unique combination of elements; emotional stakes feel human despite occasional explanatory phrasing; tone remains consistent but occasionally ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion achieved despite constraints; elements serve plot thematically more than practically; stylistic flourishes both enhance and distract; brevity is both strength and limitation.</comment>
