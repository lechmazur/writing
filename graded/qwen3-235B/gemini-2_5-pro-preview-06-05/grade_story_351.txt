<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s poetic sensibility is evident through lyrical sensibilities, but the "dreamy poet" attribute feels overshadowed by her formal rebellion against amnesia. Motivation to serve the unremembered is clear and consistent, though her actions (ceremonial ritual) reveal more discipline than dreaminess. Voice lacks distinct first-person idiosyncrasies despite poetic third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ritualistic action drives the plot efficiently within the word limit, with beginning (solving riddle), middle (waiting for shadow alignment), and end (souls released) creating a tight arc. Method of using wax-seal symbols feels internally consistent but lacks explanation beyond mystical implication. Pacing is deliberate but risks stagnation without conventional conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory immersion is exceptional—the ivy as a "slumbering serpent," coal smoke scent, and visual fragments of ghosts vividly establish decay and memory. The disused station’s decay mirrors the theme of forgotten lives, while the sundial’s verdigris surface ties setting to concept. Atmosphere enhances rather than distracts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (ivy "making space for light," sundial as "map of forgotten afternoons") creates haunting beauty. Subtext about memory’s fragility resonates through the ghosts’ half-existence. Ending’s poetic resolution ("a poem, finally remembered") ties theme to action. Minimal dialogue and focus on sensory showing elevate craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases ("thick as a slumbering serpent") border on overwritten, but originality shines in combining poetry with ghost-ritual mechanics. Avoids overt tropes through specificity—wax-seal cryptology, the sundial’s "unarrived future." Subtly layered motivation elevates beyond formula, though the "quietly intense" tone occasionally feels like checklist adherence rather than organic choice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere remarkably under constraints—the sundial’s crack as narrative focal point, the unopened letter’s symbolic weight. The compression works deliberately, using brevity to amplify the eerie stillness. Finishes on a resonant thematic note about collective memory without overstating its message.</comment>
