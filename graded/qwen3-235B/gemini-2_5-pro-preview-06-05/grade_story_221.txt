<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and introspective, with motivation tied to shadow identity and amber relic; underdeveloped Leo strains plausibility, but emotional arc remains cohesive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tight structure mirrors thematic progression from hesitation to resolution within constraints; pacing occasionally lingers on description at the expense of advancing emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (smell of rust, blank-eyed ducks) create immersive decay; parallels between drowned wrecks and haunted carnival amplify thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (amber's "golden tomb," heart-thaw, "whisperer for the dead") deepen layers; conflict introduced and resolved through interiority without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Occasional ornate phrases ("calliope music... summers long past") border on purple prose but rarely overwhelm; deeply human emotional logic and subtext prevail over formulaic constructs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements (amber, carnival, family tradition) are woven into character's psychology; some elements (thawing heart) feel slightly less earned than others.</comment>
