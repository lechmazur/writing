<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's tension is effectively tied to motivation and method, though "tense bodyguard" trait could be more actively demonstrated through physicality. Serene anger manifests as disciplined focus rather than explosive energy, which works but needs more kinetic expression. Motivation is clear, but the connection between contractual ownership and emotional yearning could use deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc within constraints, though the pivotal action of ratification feels slightly underdeveloped. The gradual collection of information creates organic momentum that pays off logically. Timeframe element lacks visible impact on pacing. Coherence is strong, but tighter integration of "timely rebirth" concept in structural beats would enhance thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lunar greenhouse offers striking visuals but underuses environmental specificity - more could be made of sensory contrasts between artificial Eden and desired natural world. The Shackleton Crater setting informs the atmosphere but deserves more tangible interaction beyond spatial placement. Tonal consistency between serene anger and fabricated environment is well maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong metaphorical language ("whispers like pollen") but occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over emotional immediacy. The central conflict is clearly conveyed through physical objects (photo) and conceptual ideas (ownership). Ending achieves thematic resonance through understated execution rather than overt dramatics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through nuanced depiction of psychological tension and bureaucratic mechanisms of control. No machine-generated repetition detected; metaphors ("low-frequency hum of resolve") feel purposefully constructed. Emotional undercurrents emerge through restrained description rather than exposition, with only occasional lapses into abstracted phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Despite containing all elements cohesively, some story components feel more organic than others. The lunar setting and photo are particularly well-integrated, while timeframe and attribute receive more functional treatment. Narrative momentum and thematic clarity suggest editorial polish, though the brief length occasionally strains explanatory space.</comment>
