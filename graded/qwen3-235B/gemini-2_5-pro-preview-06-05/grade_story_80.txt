<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are implied through actions but lack depth beyond the 'daring pathfinder' label. Motivation is present but underexplored beyond surface-level obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Logical progression from logs to door, but the conclusion feels abrupt. Pacing works within constraints; setup exceeds payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (rust, ozone) create a haunting atmosphere. Setting and tone align well, though inns are underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh premise avoids overt tropes, but some phrasing ('whispered in static') leans familiar. Tone shifts from manic to serene feel credible.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting narrative, but brevity limits thematic payoff. Ambition exceeds execution in character depth and emotional resonance.</comment>
