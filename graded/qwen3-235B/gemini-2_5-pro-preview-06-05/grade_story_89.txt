<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks nuanced behavioral complexity; actions align with stated goals but fail to reveal deeper psychological layers or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc is structurally sound but compressed; plot progression hinges on mystical handwavium rather than earned dramatic beats, undermining causal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but thematically mismatched; sterile city vs. spiritual awakening has potential but sensory details overwhelm more substantive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses potent symbols (nail/seed connection) and contemplative tone, but emotional impact is diluted by overstylization and underdeveloped consequences of the "revolution."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in concept but occasionally falters with flowery abstraction ("motes of light that danced in the air") and underexplored thematic paradoxes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coherent conceptually but thin on execution; the brevity sharpens focus on key symbols while sacrificing narrative specificity that would make the transformation visceral.</comment>
