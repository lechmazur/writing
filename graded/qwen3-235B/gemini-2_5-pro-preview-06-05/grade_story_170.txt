<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hollow ache and shame are consistent but lack visceral specificity; character's "method" feels more intellectual than emotionally lived, diluting her free-spirited dimension. Voice occasionally slips into abstraction rather than rooted subjectivity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Memorizing letters provides nominal arc but feels schematic; cause-and-effect between stone wall completion and inner healing lacks organic connection. Pacing struggles to balance exposition and introspection within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Briny atmosphere and tactile details (leather, thimble) immerse effectively; coral restoration station's "vibrant life" as counterpoint to decay is evocative, though underexplored spatial relationships weaken immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (science as poison/textile, shame as resonance) elevate, but explicit declarations of emotion undercut subtlety. Ending's juxtaposition of clinical/natural imagery offers thematic resonance within tight framework.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes in favor of psychological interiority, though "heart of doubt" and "hollow echoes" verge on clich√©. Sensory language is specific but occasionally romanticized (e.g., "rhythmic recitation" risks idealization).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Mosaic of elements suggests thematic ambition but strains coherence; emotional progression feels assembled rather than organic. Some components (e.g., sewing kit) integrate memorably, while others (coral station) remain atmospheric scaffolding.</grade>
