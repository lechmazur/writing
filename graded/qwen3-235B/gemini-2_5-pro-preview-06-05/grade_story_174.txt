<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation of regret drives the character's journey, but emotional depth is uneven, leaning on introspection without fully exploring inner conflict or secondary traits beyond his creative failure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective progression from frustration to revelation, but the leap from library to frost lacks narrative bridging, relying on poetic imagery over logical causality within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive details like the icy lacework and waterfall's mist create strong atmosphere, but the "ephemeral time" element remains abstract and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (frost revealing paths) and emotional arc resonate, though occasional exposition ("regret that had anchored him") undercuts subtlety; ending achieves thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original use of elements (e.g., silver nitrate, frost patterns) avoids clich√©; no overwrought description, though the library's mystical "forgotten knowledge" trope lacks subversion. Nuanced synthesis of science and artistry feels human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Highly cohesive despite complex layering; elements like the maple leaf and frost serve thematic unity rather than feeling forced. The brevity enhances focus on transformation.</comment>
