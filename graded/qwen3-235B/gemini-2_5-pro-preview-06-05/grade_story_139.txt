<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's stubbornness feels central but lacks nuanced depth; his methodical obsession with teeth marks is unique yet under-explored in psychological terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from dream to revelation, but the 20-year backstory feels compressed; resolution too easily flattens complexity of revenge narrative.</comment>
