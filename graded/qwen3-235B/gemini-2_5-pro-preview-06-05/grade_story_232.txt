<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris’s motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond his obsession; his reaction to the cutlass and coffee reveals determination but lacks emotional complexity. The "bleary-eyed" trait is surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot relies on a sudden, unexplained connection between coffee grounds and the cutlass; pacing is uneven, rushing from stillness to action without full logical cohesion. The beginning-end linkage feels contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (servers’ hum, cutlass’s weight) create a vivid, eerie atmosphere. The digital nomad camp contrasts intriguingly with ancient mystery, though not fully explored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (coffee as a guide, cutlass as a key) add depth. The ending’s momentum is strong, but overt phrases like “dire enchantment” reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (coffee-ground divination, cutlass as non-weapon) but leans on “obsessive scholar” tropes. Language is occasionally ornate but mostly purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but uneven; the digital nomad setting feels accessory rather than integral. The ending is evocative but the story’s brevity leaves thematic depth unfulfilled.</comment>
