<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing (somnambulist scout guided by ancestral memory) but emotionally inert; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth or evolution; actions align with traits but no unexpected contradictions or complexities emerge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent descent-discovery-ascent structure within constraints, but lacks dynamic tension or stakes; the action of "scouting" drives progression but remains procedural; abrupt transitions between exploration and resolution undermine arc cohesion in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered with sensory specificity—dappled light, moss, crystalline growths, humming decay—but leans on vaguely mystical shorthand rather than deeper ecological or historical logic to ground the setting's impossibilities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong prose style with lyrical precision ("sun bled through the canopy," "ghostly topology of her lineage") but emotional impact remains intellectualized; symbolism (light vs. darkness, science vs. spirituality) is clear but under-problematized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Creative in blending sci-fi ruins with folkloric mysticism, but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction over concrete imagery; "bottled lightning bugs" verge on novelty, and "ancestral home as territory" lacks cultural specificity; some phrases ("secrets only the dreaming could hear") tip into generic etherealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><comment>Premise shows ambition in fusing mythic and scientific frameworks, but execution feels like a sketch for a longer work; the assigned elements create intriguing textures but don't fully converge into a resonant thematic whole within the brevity.</comment>
