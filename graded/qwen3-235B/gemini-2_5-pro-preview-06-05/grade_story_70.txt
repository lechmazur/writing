<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's rigidity and emotional arc are compellingly shown through meticulous actions and pivotal discovery, though the transformation feels slightly rushed without deeper exploration of conflicting emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tightly compressed plot maintains cohesion and momentum despite the word limit, though the transition from analysis to emotional collapse could benefit from one more beat of emotional resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully intertwines setting and psychological states—the toxic botanicals mirroring emotional toxicity, Tesla bulb's evolving symbolism—but verges slightly on gothic overfamiliarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose wields devastating metaphors ('empathy in arms of steel'), with the teardrop/pollen revelation serving as both literal and thematic keystone; the final 'thunder in ears' line risks melodrama but earns its intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through unexpected emotional mechanics (analyzing loss residues), but some descriptions border on ornate ('dance of shadows,' 'glass mocking then warming') strain the precise austerity a great literary story demands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Transcends element-checking through their symbolic interweaving (envelope residue as emotional fingerprint, Tesla tech as enlightenment metaphor), though the 'glass breaking empathy' trope is slightly derivative of Gothic redemption arcs.</comment>
