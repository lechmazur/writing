<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Leo's phobias and obsessive quest drive his actions effectively, but his internal psychology remains cryptic and underexplored beyond surface-level eccentricity. His transformation is implied rather than earned through granular emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot flows logically from obsession to quest to resolution, with the net-untangling as a clear narrative pivot. Pacing falters slightly in the pyramid sequence, which feels condensed at the expense of full immersion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative, cohesive atmosphere through tactile details like "tide-worn sextant" and "dusty light in an abandoned chapel." The pyramid library’s uncanny mundanity amplifies the thematic tension between spiritual and visceral experiences.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of fear-as-knotwork resonates beyond the plot, with understated symbolism (e.g., the net as a literalized psychological barrier). The ending’s quiet catharsis avoids melodrama, leaving lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Few clichéd phrases ("psychic residue of millennia") undercut otherwise fresh imagery. Emotional nuance in Leo’s gradual self-liberation contrasts with minimalistic "telling" in his internal monologue, yielding a hybrid of show/tell.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements like the envelope and net are ingeniously interwoven, though the stunt double premise feels underutilized thematically. The compact structure suggests intentionality, with imagery and metaphor leaving a persistent, unsettling impression.</comment>
