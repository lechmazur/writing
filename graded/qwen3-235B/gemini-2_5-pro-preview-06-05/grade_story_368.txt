<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Streetwise trait informs decision-making but could have deeper character integration; voice reflects practical wisdom rather than justifies a full orphan background.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with reversed movement as central action; resolution wraps up within word limit but slightly rushed in connecting curse-breaking to hope-harvesting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid imagery of silver fruits and sentient vines builds immersive atmosphere; lacks more sensory detail to fully ground mystical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism and thematic depth about hope/darkness; evocative imagery with subtext about wisdom reshapes magic, achieving emotional resonance through "showing" more than "telling."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Some fairy-tale temple motifs are familiar, but reversed pattern solution and captured-dawn seed add originality; "street orphan solves magical puzzle" avoids formulaic execution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong craft and thematic unity mark a polished piece with literary merit; shows talent but hasn't quite achieved transcendent, once-in-a-generation quality.</comment>
