<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (challenging the status quo) is clear but lacks deeper exploration of why Finn, as a baffled pickpocket, is uniquely compelled to act. His transformation is hinted at but feels more thematic than organic, with minimal emotional depth driving his choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Poetry sessions drive the plot, but the tight word limit flattens the arc—introduction to transformation to confrontation lacks textured progression. The shift from poetry to the mayor feels abrupt, undermining cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse’s oppressive atmosphere and Silas’s uncanny presence vividly support the story’s haunted themes. Some sensory details (spectral static, rust-eaten console) immerse without overelaboration, though the "engine room" feels anachronistically industrial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistic lyricism elevates the narrative, with striking metaphors ("betrayal of a faulty lens") and haunting subtext about memory. The ending’s fusion of threat and elegy resonates, though occasional overwrought phrasing ("scorching poise") dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar Gothic tropes (haunted lighthouses, ventriloquist dummies as uncanny conduits). The fusion of pickpocket-to-avenger is fresh but underexplained. Some descriptors ("crucible," "ephemeral sorrow") border on academic abstraction rather than lived-in voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive and purposeful, though Finn’s dual life remains superficially sketched. The brevity works for mood but sacrifices depth in character logic. The mayor’s impending meeting hints at expansion but isn’t fully integrated into the present-tense immediacy.</comment>
