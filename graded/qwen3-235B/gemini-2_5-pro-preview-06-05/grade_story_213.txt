<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Minimal emotional depth despite clear, consistent motivation; sentinel's actions align with duty but lack interiority or complexity beyond their assigned role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concise, logically progressive plot with strong causal chains; pivotal action (destroying clip) feels earned, though rapid conclusion leaves some consequences underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (algae’s glow, faltering hum) and juxtaposition of sterile lab wedding with primal dawn symbolism create cohesive, haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Polished execution with potent metaphors (sunlight as truth) and thematic weight; emotional distance dilutes catharsis but reinforces the sentinel’s enigmatic aura.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with original premise; precise, uncluttered prose; nuanced interplay of tone and subtext suggests human authorship despite minimalist style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements serve the narrative effectively; some aspects (e.g., sentinel’s lineage) remain underexplored, but tight pacing and metaphorical resonance create lasting impression.</comment>
