<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but emotionally distant; faith crisis hinted through actions but lacks inner complexity beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear magical logic with thematic cohesion, but resolution feels abbreviated; tension between faith and magic resolved too abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visceral and imaginative, using sensory detail (black glass dunes, warped piano) to create a metaphysical atmosphere that shapes character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose balances restraint and surrealism; symbolism (abandoned faith, decaying piano) resonates, though some emotional beats stay just beneath surface-level transcendence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids formulaic metaphors; the piano's "capricious" energy and butterfly's timing feel purposefully strange. Only slightly over-relies on visual motifs at expense of character interiority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story works as condensed metaphysical parableâ€”elements interlock like gearwork, but the ending's intimacy feels earned rather than facile, despite narrative brevity.</comment>
