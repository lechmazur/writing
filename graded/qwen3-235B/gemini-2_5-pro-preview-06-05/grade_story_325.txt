<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finch's mad botanist persona is visually distinct but lacks psychological depth; motivations are explicit but one-dimensional, with emotional reactions primarily conveyed through exaggerated actions rather than layered characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A tightly constrained, self-contained sequence of actions builds tension, but the story prioritizes atmosphere over plot dynamics; the resolution (obtaining "heading") feels abrupt rather than dramatically earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory texture (ozone and oolong scent, visual alchemy of the projector) creates a vivid, uncanny atmosphere; however, the tea house's role as a "high-altitude nexus" remains conceptually skimmed rather than organically embedded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("ghost of a road") and thematic undercurrents about scientific obsession elevate the narrative; however, emotional engagement is mediated largely through spectacle rather than human-scale conflict or revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures with its eccentric conceits (projector-wand coupling, architectural symbolism of thread-like portals); occasionally strained phrasing ("fickle loyalty of a thing bred for consumption") momentarily undermines tonal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Narrative cohesion is achieved through meticulous aesthetic unity, though some elements (tense shifts in plant behavior, belt-film connection) feel more like puzzle pieces clicking into place than organic storytelling; ending lacks visceral impact.</comment>
