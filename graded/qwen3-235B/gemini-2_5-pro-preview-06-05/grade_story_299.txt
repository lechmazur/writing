<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s internal conflict and imperfect love are well-established, but motivation relies on familiar archetypes without delving into deeper personal stakes, weakening the emotional resonance of his sacrifice or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot meanders between introspection and thematic exposition; resolution feels abrupt despite the tight framing. The protest’s inclusion adds color but lacks narrative weight or concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (wind, brooch, chalk cliffs) that mirror the colony’s fragility. However, setting’s historical specificity remains underexplored beyond surface poeticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (amber’s trapped fly = cultural preservation) anchors the story’s emotional core. Prose elevates the theme, though quieter moments undercut the claimed "highly competitive" polish.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evidence of originality in subverting rebellion tropes (quiet archival work vs. confrontation), but some phrases (“soft stone, not molder of opinion”) lean on clichéd contrasts. Emotions are mostly earned but occasionally stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story coheres around its symbolic framework and atmospheric tension, though the brevity slightly undermines deeper exploration of the colony’s history or the protagonist’s transformation.</comment>
