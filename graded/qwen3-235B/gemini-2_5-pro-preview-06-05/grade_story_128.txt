<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is evident but underexplored; his archery skills do little to shape the narrative beyond the final action. Internal conflict lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves decisively but feels compressed; the leap between decoding subtitles and escaping strains logic despite tight pacing. Cause-effect links are functional but superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting shifts impressively but thinly—Egyptian details are atmospheric but not fully integrated with the surreal TV element. Sensory contrasts work, but worldbuilding remains shallow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and the ending's liberation resonate emotionally. The storytelling-as-escape theme is clear but underdeveloped. Avoids clichés but lacks layered meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>No major tropes or purple prose; some phrases ("gilded cage") border on conventional. Emotional beats avoid over-explanation but could be more nuanced. Generally inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements fit cohesively but mechanically. The story hinges on surreal logic over thematic integration; the ending satisfies but feels more whimsical than profound.</comment>
