<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's remorse and motivation are clear but lack emotional depth; reactions to objects and actions insufficiently reveal inner complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed; the ritual’s action drives the story, though resolution feels abrupt despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is evocative and immersive, with sensory details that deepen atmosphere; shipwrecks and greenhouse strongly enhance tone and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and imagery (e.g., fingerprint merging as reconciliation) delivers emotional impact, but some ideas are told rather than shown, diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original and precise use of objects (bone needle, algae) avoids cliché; tone and details are distinct, though "wild frontier" and "indifferent enthusiasm" lean on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with strong thematic interplay; the story feels intentional within its brevity, though some elements’ roles lack nuance.</comment>
