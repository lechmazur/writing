<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prometheus-like tragic determination, but lacks emotional vulnerability beneath the intellectual obsession. Dialogue-free narrative reduces emotional stakes despite distinct voice in cryptic notes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fractal progression of discoveries builds momentum, but the silent revolution's timeframe truncates character arc resolution. Pacing sacrifices causal clarity in final third.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visceral urban decay details undercut by inconsistent quantum-anomalies. The "shimmering reality" remains frustratingly abstract - stronger synesthetic descriptions needed for full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose achieves poetic resonance in documenting memory ghosts, but the ending's "silent march" clich√© undercuts earlier innovation. Subtext-rich through layered perspectives.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dodge the expected time-travel tropes, but occasional phrases like "temporal flotsam" border on neologism overkill. Emotional subtext expressed through artifacts rather than direct statement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Element synergy creates metaphysical anthropology texture. The constrained form feels intentional, though deeper exploration of the director's perspective would enhance dimensional complexity.</comment>
