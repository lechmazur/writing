<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters serve as symbols rather than fully dimensional beings; Kai's muteness is intriguing but underexploited, while guests remain archetypes with gestures substituting for developed motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot compresses a monumental shift into a single action with clarity; time-limited tension between obsidian and light beings resolved through elegant choreography of shared meal. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Haunting industrial decay meets otherworldly elegance in atmospheric details; sensory motifs (steam, dissonant melody) bind setting to emotional undertones more effectively than most genre fiction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in unexpected combinations (boat-chef-music box-diplomacy) but stumbles with overpolished prose; some cosmic descriptors verge on ornamental. No element feels algorithmically generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of bizarre elements achieves tonal unity; brevity works as philosophical meditation on conflict resolution, but thematic overtone occasionally crowds out emotional nuance.</comment>
