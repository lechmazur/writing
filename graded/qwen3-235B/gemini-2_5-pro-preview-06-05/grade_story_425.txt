<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is efficient but surface-level; Kaelan’s shift from warrior to mender is conceptually compelling, but emotional beats (like his transition from gloom to purpose) feel truncated. Dialogue reveals core motivation, but interiority lacks visceral complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Efficient use of constraints: blackout as narrative trigger works, and the needle-based solution ties causality to thematic resonance. Pacing is brisk but occasionally flattens logical stakes (e.g., why the spire destabilizes). Closed loop between disillusionment and rekindled purpose works within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong opening tone (“lavishly austere,” “boring”) sets mood but underdevelops sensory texture. Cosmic fraying and emergency lighting are vivid but inconsistently layered; atmosphere aids plot more than deepens thematic resonance. Tactile details (needle’s weight) contrast with vague environmental descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of mending vs. violence is sharply executed with poetic restraint. Dialogue avoids exposition; subtext about preservation over destruction is resonant. Ending’s philosophical twist (“terribly bored of the alternative”) is memorable, though emotional immediacy is diluted by abstract cosmic language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by pairing the “last star” trope with a maintenance-focused apocalypse. Needle’s symbolism transcends gimmickry, though some phrases (“visible changes,” “cosmic energies”) verge on generic. Language balances poetic and efficient without devolving into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain plausibility (e.g., blackout’s function as plot device). Conceptual layers (duty vs. obsolescence) linger beyond the narrative, but brevity sacrifices worldbuilding density. Ending lands with symbolic weight.</comment>
