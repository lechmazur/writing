<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's grief and role as a historian shape his actions, but "passionately indifferent" feels underdeveloped. Motivation is clear but lacks depth in emotional nuance during introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from memory retrieval to documentation. Tight word economy works, though the connection between parade hush and resolution feels slightly tenuous rather than thematically vital.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (stale beer scent, phantom light) create atmosphere. Parade setting contrasts with solemnity, but secret society hall feels underutilized as a symbolic space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (bell as failed warning, red lights as "surrender") deepen meaning. The wry closing line elevates the poignant levity tone with emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; nightmare-retrieval method feels original. Some phrases ("searing after-images") border on overly literary. Emotional resonance shown through actions over explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively toward documenting progress' costs. Tight format serves the theme, though the "secret society" element feels slightly superfluous. Ends with thematic weight.</comment>
