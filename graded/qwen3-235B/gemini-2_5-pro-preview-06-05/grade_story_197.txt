<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation is implied but not explored. Actions align with traits but reveal little about internal conflicts or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional arc or resolution; the ascent serves as progression but fails to deliver a cohesive narrative within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and immersive atmosphere elevate the setting, though the "Tree" concept risks vagueness without deeper mythic grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphorical framing create emotional resonance, but the story leans on poetic abstraction over concrete thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "cosmic lullaby") stand out, but the abstract tone occasionally veers into ornate abstraction without sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ideas are compelling, but the story relies on concept over execution; cohesion exists, but market competitiveness is weak without stronger narrative stakes.</comment>
