<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has defined traits and a clear arc but lacks depth in emotional nuance and fully realized internal conflict; motivations are implied but not fully dramatized through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and thematically driven but strained by the word limit, with flashbacks and philosophical musings disrupting pacing and tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details effectively evoke decay and introspection, but relies on familiar imagery (mist, rust) without transcending genre tropes for setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative language and metaphorical resonance elevate the narrative; themes of preservation vs. loss are layered, though emotional payoff is softened by brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains familiar literary motifs (street philosophers, haunted landscapes); prose balances lyricism and clarity but occasionally lapses into aestheticized despair.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively but leans on thematic convenience; the abrupt emotional climax feels more engineered than earned.</comment>
