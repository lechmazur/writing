<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara's identity as a dream thief shapes her actions but lacks psychological complexity; her fragmented self is conveyed but motivations remain abstract, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but struggles with pacing compression; the climactic "plunge" feels underdeveloped despite strong symbolic payoff in the final image.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ruined treehouse and post-human setting rendered with atmospheric precision; sensory details like decaying books and psychic echoes create haunting immersion that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("psychic boom") and layered imagery elevate storytelling; ending's emotional weight is undercut slightly by overly cryptic interiority masking character depth deficits.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Avoids genre tropes through original dream-theft mechanics and conceptual fusion of memory/sport; some overly abstract phrasing ("hollow space filled with echoes") borders on pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements create haunting conceptual framework but uneven execution: the sport-based collective memory concept overpowers weaker aspects like the functionally ornamental mathematical challenge trait.</comment>
