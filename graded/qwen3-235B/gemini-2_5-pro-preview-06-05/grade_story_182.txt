<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Absorbing voice but lacks psychological complexity; transformation relies on sudden epiphany over progressive development. Internal conflict remains underexplored beneath the poetic surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Visually cohesive arc but resolution feels rushed; cause-and-effect hinges too easily on magical mural discovery. Pacing oscillates between lush detail and perfunctory revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and sensorily richâ€”the crumbling theater's tactile details and magnetic resonance create haunting presence. However, the mountain remains atmospheric garnish rather than narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors pulse with electricity, and the ending carries resonance. Some lyrical passages risk overwhelming the narrative through density; emotional beats occasionally tell rather than show despite vivid imagery elsewhere.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Originality in concept is undermined by formulaic character introspection that reads like polished genre template. Language dazzles but occasionally slips into poetic overdrive without sufficient thematic ballast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements merge into cohesive whole but never transcend their assigned roles to become fully transcendent. The final image lingers, but the story's ambition sometimes outpaces its execution's precision.</comment>
