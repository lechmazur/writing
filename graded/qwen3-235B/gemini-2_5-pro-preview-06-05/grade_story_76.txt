<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's actions align with his stated motivation to find beauty in decay, but "shyly unstoppable" lacks depth. Emotion is shown through ritualistic actions but lacks internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression with clear beginning/middle/end (ritual → discovery → transformation → return), but lacks traditional conflict or tension. Pacing is deliberate, tension minimal.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Immersive setting through sensory details (fog, rust, decay), but some descriptions lean toward ornate excess. Atmosphere reinforces theme of hidden beauty but occasionally overwhelms narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("world bent," "film of the ship’s soul") and evocative imagery. Ending circles back to quiet satisfaction, but emotional resonance remains subdued.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in using censored text to access lost memories; avoids overt tropes. Some phrases ("phantom breeze") veer toward cliché, but tone avoids over-sentimentality. Feels human-crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements (ruins, magnifier, ritual) integrate cohesively. Lacks transformative subtext or thematic ambition that would justify top-tier prestige. Lingering resonance is atmospheric, not philosophical.</comment>
