<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak emotional nuance in character's internal conflict; motivation explained but underdeveloped through actions. Obsessive focus on singular metaphor lacks progression beyond static melancholy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on repetitive daydream loops that hinder progression; ending resolution feels abrupt despite thematic resonance. Time constraint poorly managed with uneven pacing between concept exposition and payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting evokes mood but fails to evolve beyond aesthetic isolation. Inkwell symbolism underutilized in wilderness context; atmospheric elements remain superficial despite vivid descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (laughter as weight, inkwell as void) undercut by overly abstract language. Thematic ambition in exploring manufactured vs authentic emotion; resolution lacks satisfying narrative tension payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overly poetic descriptions border on affectation; some emotional beats rely on stated existential dread rather than subtext. Conceptual premise original but execution employs predictable melancholic tropes without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements勉强 integrated through thematic threads but lack organic cohesion. Overreliance on symbolic shorthand prevents deeper engagement; poetic tone maintained at expense of character verisimilitude.</comment>
