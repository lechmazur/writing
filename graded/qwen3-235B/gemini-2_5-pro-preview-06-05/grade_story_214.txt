<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's grief-as-antenna transformation is conceptually rich but lacks physiological/emotional texture; motivations shift too cleanly from despair to enlightenment without granular psychological friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on intellectual Revelation through microfilm, which risks cerebral detachment; pacing during discovery moment strains credibility but ends with emotionally resonant circularity between the sea glass' introduction and thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The void-dark atmosphere excels through "ink" stars and grimy console projections, but floating observatory's physicality remains frustratingly abstract - lacks tactile details about weightlessness or artificial ecosystems that could ground the cosmic melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors sing (gravitational whispers, cosmic song), ending transcends self-pity through the "light in collapse" epiphany; slightly undercut by overreliance on adjectival mood-setting ("terrible gift," "hollowing") that tells instead of shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids cosmic horror tropes through uniquely quantum-philosophical grief interpretation; some phrases ("black hole of doubt") flirt with overused physics metaphors but are redeemed by the story's subversion of "signal detection" as emotional archaeology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere but occasionally strain under conceptual ambition - the sea glass as emotional conduit works brilliantly while the "shady archives" method feels like narrative scaffolding rather than authentic worldbuilding choice.</comment>
