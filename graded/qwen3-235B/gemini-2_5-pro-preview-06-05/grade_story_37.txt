<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth; past as con artist insufficiently integrated into actions/motivation. Momentary glimpses of internal conflict but lacks sustained psychological nuance. Sworn protector role feels hastily introduced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented structure undermines coherence. Detour-to-redemption arc feels contrived. Doctor’s waiting room framing device poorly resolved. Pacing uneven between dense exposition and abrupt conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid but superficial details—ceiba tree, swinging bridges—but emotional resonance diluted by generic sensory descriptors. Atmosphere occasionally veers into exoticism without deep cultural grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Yodel-as-identity metaphor powerfully executed. Emotional impact from tactile details (crumpled sheet music, boy’s hand grasp). Subtext about legacy through non-violent, non-transactional creation elevates narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids complete formula despite redemption arc. Sheet music’s purpose twist defies expectations. Some purple prose (“map of wrinkles”) but largely restrained. Emotional stakes shown through symbolic action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Broad thematic cohesion exists but strained by uneven integration of elements. Short length exposes underdeveloped connections between assigned components. Lingering impression lies in metaphor, not narrative structure.</comment>
