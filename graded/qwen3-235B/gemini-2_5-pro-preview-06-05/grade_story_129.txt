<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation drives the character, whose somber nature directly informs his method of silent, tactile storytelling. The ring and tablecloths reveal psychological depth, but interiority occasionally leans on exposition rather than fully embodied action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherent structural arc with a beginning anchored in ritual and an end marked by emotional release, but the brevity strains the climactic "torpedo" action—its execution feels abrupt without deeper cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially immersive setting, with rusted rocketry mirroring familial decay. The atmosphere of desolate reinvention powerfully supports thematic parallels between environmental and emotional transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stunning metaphorical precision in "silent music" and "empathy as weapon." Subtext about inherited emotional atrophy is layered and resonant, though the ending risks sentimentality through understated delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in tablecloths-as-ancestral-diary; avoids cliché by literalizing emotional inheritance through textiles. Some phrases ("concrete cathedral") flirt with overwrought abstraction, but overall voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elements cohere around emotional archaeology—aesthetic austerity of the setting, the tactile weight of objects, and temporal liminality. The theme of cyclical healing lingers provocatively.</comment>
