<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (defiance through preservation of the comic) is clear and consistent, but lacks depth beyond thematic purpose; no internal conflict beyond surface-level ideology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying circularity (start/end with pulses) and momentum, though the act of releasing the comic feels more symbolic than consequential within the narrative framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Quantum foam setting is visceral and unique; however, the "between shifts" timeframe feels underutilized, diluting the tension between personal and institutional time constraints.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (desert as a decoy, comic as hope) are evocative; the subtext about hope vs. control resonates, elevated by the final image of the desert's "grains" as a hidden promise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in juxtaposing sterile bureaucracy with the comic's vibrancy; avoids clich√©s through precise, non-overwritten language; occasional ornate phrasing ("roiling chaos of potential realities") enhances rather than overwhelms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole; the quantum foam and desert misdirection are especially integral. Final reflection on "building a future" justifies brevity as thematic compression.</comment>
