<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic but underdeveloped; "warmly aloof" and desperation about time aren't fully embodied through action or inner monologue. Motivation feels abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc is conceptually complete but pacing falters - the causal chain between chalk-drawing and vanishing glosses over key transitions. Plot momentum stalls in middle paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Space pirate setting adds visual flavor but doesn't shape the character's dilemma. Sensory details are selective (ozone scent) rather than immersive; nebula's cosmic quality unevenly matched to gritty cargo hold locale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors ("tangled screaming knot of time") and imagery of chalk maps mirror existential themes effectively. Ending's haunting quality lingers, though emotional impact remains tempered by emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but "gentle harshness" and time-fraying tropes tread familiar speculative ground. Language balances poetics and clarity, though cosmic cloud-path tracking in space strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story hinges on strong conceptual skeleton but thin flesh. Assigned elements cohere logically but don't interlock synergistically - would survive swapping of certain images/tropes.</comment>
