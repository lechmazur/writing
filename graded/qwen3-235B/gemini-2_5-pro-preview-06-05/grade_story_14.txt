<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, but character’s internal conflict lacks layered depth; interactions hint at psychological complexity but don’t fully explore it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from setup to gamble, but the climax feels slightly rushed—miracle’s execution lacks emotional buildup needed for full impact.</comment>
