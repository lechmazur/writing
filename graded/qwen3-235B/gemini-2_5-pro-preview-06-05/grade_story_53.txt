<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character reacts to the postcards as a protector but lacks interiority on how past trauma shapes his actions; motivation for seeking cosmic solace is stated but not deeply explored through nuanced behavior or reflection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc from isolation to revelation is clear but slightly uneven—the postcard-cavern connection emerges abruptly; pacing balances tension and introspection within word count but relies on convenient rockfall as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting immerses through visceral details (howling wind, vibrating bones) and symbology—fortress as cosmic amplifier versus cavern as character/plot catalyst. Atmosphere flawlessly supports mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "roadmap of wrinkles") and subtext (postcards as invitations) elevate themes; ending resonates conceptually but emotional impact is diluted by abstract epiphany over earned character emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in reimagining postcards as cosmic bridges; avoids genre tropes but occasionally leans on familiar "lone wanderer" archetypes. Language is purposeful but some phrasing (e.g., "deep and unnerving calm") verges on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Story feels purposefully concise; elements like the fortress and postcards work thematically, though rapid shifts (woman’s appearance, sudden awareness) sacrifice some emotional gravity for conceptual elegance.</comment>
