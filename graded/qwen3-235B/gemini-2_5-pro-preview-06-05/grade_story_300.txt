<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cassius displays consistent motivation through his wistfully pragmatic pursuit of the power source, but his outlaw status remains underexplored beyond scavenging. His cynical voice is distinct but lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightly paced with clear arc: begins with obsessive quest, executes through meticulous method, concludes with successful discovery. Logical cause/effect chain with no superfluous details within constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Immersive Roman setting rendered through sensory details (fish stench, clatter of marketplace). The contrast between grandiose imperial imagery and grimy reality reinforces the tone effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative symbolic construction: abstract art as celestial map, paint smudges as cryptographic clues. Subtext about art's transformative power beneath surface quest. Ending creates resonant thematic echo through physical sensation of the pouch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing while maintaining classical storytelling elements. The paint-matching method feels fresh; emotional nuance through actions rather than exposition. Language remains precise without excess ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements serve cohesive whole: Roman setting enables scavenging culture, paint analysis method shapes narrative progression. Brevity feels deliberate through expert compression of character and plot.</comment>
