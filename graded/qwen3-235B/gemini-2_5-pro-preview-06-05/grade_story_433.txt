<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits like "hardheadedness" drive the plot, but emotional depth feels underexplored despite the pivotal realization; motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict to justify transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plotted with clear progression and resolution, but the tight word limit forces uneven pacing—transformation feels abrupt, and the reliance on exposition weakens narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Richly rendered frost imagery enhances tone, but sensory details are inconsistently applied; the ephemeral gallery's thematic resonance is diluted by underexplored connections to the acorn's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism elevates the theme of rebirth, but emotional impact is undercut by overly abstract phrasing; the acorn twist is poignant but risks feeling didactic rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose wavers between lyrical and overwrought; some metaphors ("whisper-soft sigh of melting frost") fresh, others ("rivers of snow") clichéd. The character's arc leans on stated revelations rather than implicit subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven—ephemeral art gallery and acorn concept succeed, while prophecy/method feel imposed. The concise structure is effective but leaves thematic complexity underdeveloped.</comment>
