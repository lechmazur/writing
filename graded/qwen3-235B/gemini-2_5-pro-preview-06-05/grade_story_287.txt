<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara’s “torn visionary” trait is inconsistently rendered—her resolve and doubt lack emotional nuance. The stranger’s role exposes her motivation abruptly without layered development, and her voice remains underexplored beyond cryptic exposition. The final surrender lacks visceral weight despite prior isolation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The plot’s arc—solitary pursuit interrupted by collaboration—is conceptually sound but underdeveloped. The stranger’s introduction and resolution hinge on contrivance (the shared book), and the pacing feels compressed, leaving the orrery’s reconstruction and thematic “cycle” ambiguous within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The overgrown library excels as a sensory-rich setting, blending decay and latent potential. Moss, vellum, and frescoes effectively ground the atmosphere. The “careful wildness” tone aligns with Elara’s character, but the timeframe metaphor (“breath after a child’s question”) remains abstract, only loosely influencing the plot’s stillness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., “data-ghosts,” orrery as “monument to missing pieces”) elevate the craft. Emotional resonance is undercut by reliance on poetic abstraction over concrete character reactions. The ending’s thematic pivot to shared effort is poignant, but subtext feels underexplored beneath lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While avoiding overt tropes (e.g., the stranger isn’t a savior but a collaborator), the narrative leans on familiar isolation-to-redemption beats. The 1920 cellphone avoids steampunk clichés, but overuse of “lingering stillness” and “catacombs of lost knowledge” edges toward genre familiarity without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion is strained by uneven integration of elements: the timeframe and “careful wildness” feel tacked on. However, the orrery’s “missing pieces” and the library’s decay cohesively mirror Elara’s internal void, suggesting thematic intent beyond surface plot.</comment>
