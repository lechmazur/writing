<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct with "flippant solemnity" and brewer's purist values informing action, but grogginess feels underutilized as a defining trait rather than superficial descriptor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of confrontation/resolution with cause-effect logic, but the lull in protest timing as critical window strains plausibility and feels artificially constructed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere well-established through sensory decay and oppressive weight, but graveyard setting remains more thematic backdrop than active narrative force with limited connection to core action inside mansion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Memorable metaphors (warped light, evil as "generic") provoke thought, with purification method metaphorically rich. Emotional impact remains surface-level despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through paradoxical "generic evil" and protest setting fusion. Sensory details precise rather than purple. Transitions coherent with human-flawed but not algorithmic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements mostly well-integrated with clear thematic threads (purification vs corruption), though protest connection and graveyard relevance could be more organically developed rather than contextual embellishments.</comment>
