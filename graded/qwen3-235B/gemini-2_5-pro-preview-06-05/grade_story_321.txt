<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is well-articulated through abstract metaphor, but lacks concrete behavioral specificity; motivations are emotionally resonant yet occasionally abstracted into poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc, though structural complexity risks overcrowding the limited space; thematic resolution crystallizes effectively despite compressed chronology.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully created through synesthetic detail and mythic metaphor; the infernal setting's oppressive quality becomes a character in itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Striking original imagery occasionally veers toward self-conscious preciousness; some metaphors risk overextension, though emotional psychology avoids AI-like abstraction through visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole; each required component functions as organic metaphor, though brevity necessitates some conceptual compression.</comment>
