<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s apprehension and motivation are present but not deeply explored; gestures toward inner conflict remain surface-level, and emotional stakes lack the layered nuance required for top-tier literary work.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and a clear arc within constraints, but the pivotal action (uttering a password) resolves too easily, diminishing tension; cause-and-effect is logical but lacks escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on stark contrasts (machine vs. organic, cold vs. warm) and vivid sensory details, though some descriptions (e.g., “processed lies”) border on abstraction without grounding specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story evokes resonance through metaphor (candle as truth’s persistence) and subverts tech-savior tropes, but emotional depth could be more subtly conveyed through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls, but phrases like “borrowed dawn” and “defiant warmth” lean toward vague poeticism; character decision-making (e.g., using a spoken phrase as a key) feels contrived despite thematic intention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but not innovatively; the brief form feels restrictive rather than purposeful, and the closing image, while resonant, lacks lingering ambiguity or complexity.</comment>
