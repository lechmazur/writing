<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (vow to rebuild a world) is clear and consistent with Kaelen's actions, but emotional depth feels surface-level despite poetic descriptions. His "loving detachment" lacks human nuance, leaning on stylized phrasing over psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured within the constraint, with a clear narrative arc from salvaging scraps to completing the mosaic. The action of meddling through collage-making drives progression cohesively, though the final image's fate feels underexplored thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>World-building is evocative but thin—holographic ads and recycling grinders suggest futurism, while sea pottery creates poignant juxtaposition. Sensory details are strong but unevenly distributed; tonal contrasts between industrial decay and artistic reverie work well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling excels with metaphorically rich prose (weaving fate from refuse, swordsman's grace as artistic process). The ending's quiet resignation creates thematic resonance, though first-person elements are absent to maintain the spectral emotional tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls, subverting "haunted swordsman" tropes through artistry-as-redemption. Some phrases ("calloused from plasma-katana" or "jagged edges of discarded skyline") border on ornate, but emotional subtext through objects feels authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High cohesion under strict element constraints—each assigned component serves thematic or narrative purpose without feeling forced. The brief form enhances the elegiac tone, though the story sacrifices narrative expansion for lyrical compression.</comment>
