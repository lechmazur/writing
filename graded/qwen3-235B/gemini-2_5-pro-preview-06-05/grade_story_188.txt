<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Catalyst for change hinted but lacks depth in exploring his internal struggle's complexity; motivations shift feels too pat, though quiet desperation is palpable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lean structure works within constraints, but the inciting incident (letter) feels contrived, weakening cause-effect logic; arc is complete yet slight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere with sensory details, but cultural fusion of Western lawman and Japanese setting remains superficial, creating dissonance without intentional contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and effective symbolism (kintsugi metaphor) deepen subtext; ending resonates thematically, though some descriptions border on ornamental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but exhibits faintly formulaic emotional beats; tone remains consistent, yet blends melancholy and resolution with uneven precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Elements unite around self-reconciliation theme, but cultural hybridity feels underexplored; the ending's philosophical weight elevates a modest premise.</grade>
