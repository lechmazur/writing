<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters show emotional complexity and mutual history, but their roles as performers/adversaries aren't fully integrated with the truce motif; motivations are clear but could deepen ties between Kael's deceptive artistry and his peace-seeking.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Memory-action connection drives the plot, but the childhood flashback disrupts pacing. The coral-triggered epiphany creates a logical arc, but the tight word count strains organic progression; the ending suggests resolution while leaving emotional stakes undefined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Steampunk machinery contrasts effectively with the organic coral/memory imagery, but the carved reef as symbolic motif lacks full thematic integration. Atmosphere is immersive but inconsistent in its fusion of industrial and maritime elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (gauntlet as burden, gears vs. tides) deepen resonance. The dialogue-as-pact device is understatedly powerful. Subtext about inherited legacies shines, though emotional beats occasionally verge on melodramatic ("barren stage"; "seed of trust").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concise but ambitious structure handles multiple elements without collapse, though the street performer's artistry feels peripheral. The core truce narrative is emotionally compelling, but the setting's aesthetic duality remains underexplored.</comment>
