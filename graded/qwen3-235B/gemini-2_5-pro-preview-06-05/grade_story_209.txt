<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are tied to grief, effectively revealed through the hairbrush, but the "seasoned woodsman" trait feels underdeveloped beyond the final line. The voice and internal conflict are strong but lack fuller contextual integration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with cause-effect clarity (hospital beep → short-circuit), though the shift from technical focus to emotional collapse feels abrupt. The arc (denial → catharsis) is complete but could deepen the middle progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (metallic air, humming antennas) but the "radio wave garden" and water tower’s connection to ghost-tunnels lack full realization. Sensory details are strong but occasionally vague rather than hyper-specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent emotional catharsis via the hairbrush revelation and "spent current" metaphor. The theme (grief as mapped terrain) resonates, though some lines ("ache in his chest") edge on conventionality. Ending is memorable, conceptually layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in concept (sonar failure mirroring emotional collapse) but stumbles with occasionally overwrought descriptors ("spectral energy," "rusted dreams"). Emotions are subtextually handled but occasionally undercut by overt phrases like "profound silence."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>ELEMENTS are mostly well-integrated, with the hairbrush, sonar failure, and hospital beep working synergistically. However, the "woodsman" and "radio wave garden" feel loosely connected to the emotional core. Style serves the theme but occasionally falters under ornate flourishes.</comment>
