<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Limited space but sharp voice establishes Kael's self-lacerating duality; motivation is coherent but lacks emotional layers beyond grief-driven obstinacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf revelation drives momentum effectively, but the truncated arc feels artificially compressed rather than organically resolved; jogging as repeated gesture lacks narrative pay-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vividly realized decay of the flight deck—cracked permacrete, skeletal starships—perfectly mirrors Kael's emotional desolation and futile hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("poisonously blooming hope") and physicalized absence create emotional resonance; ending avoids sentimentality but lacks thematic density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Limited clichéd elements (desert quest) but avoids full trope reliance through idiosyncratic details (cold sludge tea, chopstick specificity) and psychological complexity in grief portrayal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates lingering melancholy, though the miniature scale prevents full thematic expansion; jogging as structural device works best.</comment>
