<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation to overcome inherited prejudice is clear but internal conflict lacks gradual development; emotional arc is sincere but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc with clear emotional resolution; some narrative compression (e.g., farmer's market backstory) feels slighted but doesn't derail momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting merges decaying grandeur with synthetic warmth effectively; sensory details (e.g., metallic vines, dust-caked screen) deepen thematic contrasts between organic and artificial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (phantom punch as emotional barrier) and juxtaposition of Chancellor's rhetoric vs. quiet acceptance create layered subtext; prose is evocative and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in merging sci-fi constructs with intimate emotional stakes; avoids genre clich√©s through nuanced introspection and symbolic objects rather than contrived tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion (e.g., decay mirrors prejudice); some aspects (e.g., farmer's market meeting) feel underexplored but overall maintains stylistic clarity and emotional punch.</comment>
