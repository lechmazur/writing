<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct, but motivation (family's fate vs. tyranny) lacks depth; traits like 'cynically gentle' inform actions but feel underexplored</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and purposefully compressed, though time travel execution relies on abrupt celestial alignment; pacing prioritizes poetic beats over narrative tension</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere impressively in concept, but some—like shadows’ sentience—receive minimal explanation; brevity works thematically but risks abstraction</comment>
