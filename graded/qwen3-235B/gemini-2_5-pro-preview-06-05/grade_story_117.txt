<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weakness in depth of internal conflict; motivation stated rather than dramatized through action. Calm demeanor consistent but lacks human nuance in emotional transitions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but musical trail lacks tactile cause/effect logic. Pacing uneven in middle section with abrupt tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Eerie visuals strong but inconsistent texture - wine cellar flashes distract from horror-adjacent atmosphere. Temperature motif effective, olfactory details missing in immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance between fragmented lens and self-expression powerful. Subtext about harmonizing chaos with calm insightful. Ending transcendent yet earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original framing of melody-as-madness avoids horror tropes but contains occasional purple prose ("dust mote of pure sound"). Emotional resonance more shown than told, with some conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Strong thematic coherence but question whether all elements equally essential - the winter timeframe's thematic role feels thinner than other components.</grade>
