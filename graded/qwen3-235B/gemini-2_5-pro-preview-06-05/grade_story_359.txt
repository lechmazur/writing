<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's absent-mindedness drives the plot but lacks depth in exploring how this trait shaped his career as a brewer; motivations are hinted at but underdeveloped, reducing emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compact structure with a clear emotional arc, but the resolution feels abrupt; the journey from resignation to tentative hope requires more nuanced cause-and-effect progression within the tight frame.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in the listening booth scene elevate atmosphere, but the nature sound archive setting isn't fully leveraged to deepen thematic parallels between archival preservation and brewing craft.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (e.g., "kinesthize," "rain's rhythm") shine, but emotional beats rely too heavily on abstract summaries rather than fully realized psychological shifts in the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh concept of sonic fermentation and AI obsolescence avoids genre clich√©s; occasionally undercut by mechanical similes ("tasting like ash") and underexplored emotional subtext between human and algorithmic "feeling."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain under the weight of thematic ambition; the brevity works against deeper exploration of core ideas despite skillful synthesis of character and theme.</comment>
