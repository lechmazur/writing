<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character is well-defined through details (e.g., shimmering coat, obsession with fragmented narratives), but lacks deeper psychological complexity despite strong thematic alignment with assigned traits. Motivation feels plausible but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from archival work to override climax, but some transitions (e.g., chamber synthesis mechanics) feel under-explained. Pacing is tight but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Immersive descriptions create eerie, sterile atmosphere, but the 'after last star map' timeframe feels underexploited. Sensory details (e.g., fogged beaker) enhance mood, but temporal context lacks emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., 'digital attics,' 'memories clinging to emulsion') and thematic cohesion about memory as biological inheritance. Ending elevates the piece, though emotional stakes remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original premise blending genetic science with ancestral myth, but occasional overuse of poetic abstractions ('whispers of lived lives') edges toward AI-like flourishes. Avoids major clichés while maintaining stylistic singularity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive use of elements creates a transcendent final image, but the narrative’s conceptual ambition occasionally outpaces emotional granularity. Polished enough for elite venues, though not flawless.</comment>
