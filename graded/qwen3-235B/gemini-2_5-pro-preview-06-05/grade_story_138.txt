<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to dismantle illusions is clear, but falls short in showing nuanced psychological depth; his noble status informs little beyond surface-level pretensions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fragments of brilliance exist but struggle under weight of assigned elements; symbolic cohesion admirable but structural integrity compromised by narrative shorthand.</comment>
