<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are intellectually clear but lack concrete actions beyond introspection; internal conflict is well-articulated but embodiment through specific decisions feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows linearly but relies heavily on internal monologue to create momentum; beginning and end connect via thematic repetition rather than narrative causality, yet maintains coherence through atmospheric continuity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral imagery (ozone-taste, fractal snow) immerses effectively; the beanstalk labyrinth's symbolic resonance with spiritual/physical entrapment enriches atmosphere, though connection to plot progression remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Language achieves lyrical precision in metaphors (snow as "language," abacus as metaphor); subtext about systems breaking down permeates structurally, with ending resonating as both thematic crescendo and existential question.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing with unique juxtapositions ("pearlescent clouds," "hollow divine plan"); metaphors serve thematic purpose rather than decoration; emotional nuance shown through objects rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Premise could feel gimmicky but elements work symbiotically (beanstalks' scale emphasize futility of control, abacus's gaps mirror protagonist's worldview); theme of escaping systems resonates beyond plot, though emotional stakes remain cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
