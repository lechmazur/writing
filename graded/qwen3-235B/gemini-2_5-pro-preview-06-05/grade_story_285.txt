<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations feel imposed rather than organic. The awkwardness feels tacked on, not integrated into his arc. The blank postcard's symbolic purpose remains superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot lurches between atmospheric moments without clear progression. The hermit crab method muddies the narrative logic. Ending feels abrupt, disconnected from initial despair. Pacing drags on emergent action, rushes resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking sensory details create immersive environment, but setting doesn't drive the story. The tundra orchard's contrasts fail to echo internal conflicts. Atmosphere sustains tone but remains decorative rather than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphors (sword as offering, light lattice) create haunting visuals. Emotional impact diluted by abrupt transitions. Theme of tradition vs. renewal hinted at but underdeveloped. Show-don't-tell principle inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dares originality with hermit crab transmigration concept yet stumbles with cold-logic implementation. Avoids genre tropes but falls into poetic abstractionism. Some phrases ("watery veil") verge on purple prose. Emotional nuance remains mostly surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formal language and fragmented cohesion undermine potential. Assigned elements superficially integrated rather than organically developed. Brief length exposes undercooked ideas but leaves lingering impression through vivid, flawed symbolism.</comment>
