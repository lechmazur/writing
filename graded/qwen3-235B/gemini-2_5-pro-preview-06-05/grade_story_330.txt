<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's transformation feels abrupt, motivations implied but underdeveloped. Internal conflict lacks psychological depth despite poetic metaphors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure constrained by word count. Pacing lurches between lingering descriptions and sudden action. Thirteenth chime payoff lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zero-gravity hall rendered through vivid, original imagery. Sensory details create immersive atmosphere, but deeper connections between setting elements (sacred disorder, sunken realm) remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exceptional command of metaphor (iron/sorrow, war drum heartbeat) creates strong atmospheric impact. Emotional stakes remain abstract despite technical polish.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unusual setting. Some overused constructions ("ghost of iron," "buoyant disorder") and inconsistent tonal shifts. Emotional progression feels algorithmically logical rather than organically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrated but unevenly weighted. High-concept components (ley lines, thirteenth chime) feel under-explained. Lingering impression of beautiful fragments rather than unified whole.</comment>
