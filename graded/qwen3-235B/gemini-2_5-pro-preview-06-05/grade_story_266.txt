<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clown's painted sadness dominates, but lacks behavioral specificity; motivation to "master despair" is clear but underexplored through action beyond poetic confession; emotional shifts feel schematic rather than organically earned through situational response</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Static contemplation risks stasis; poetic deconstruction provides structural spine but climax/resolution (shared poem's impact) feels abrupt; thematic throughlines (flight vs. grounding) emerge late rather than shaping whole</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Strikingly surreal visuals lack physicality; floating stone's sensations, yoga studio's purpose, and clock's mechanics remain unexplored; atmospheric potential undermined by underdeveloped spatial/tactile detail</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radiant metaphors ("caged smile," "trapped dancer") elevate thematic resonance; ending's subtle triumph avoids sentimentality; subtext on performative serenity vs. authentic connection rewards attentive reading</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original framework undermined by occasional ornate phrasing ("vortex of meaningless motion"); avoids overt tropes while engaging existential themes; emotional texture deepens through poetic acts rather than exposition</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly integrate narratively; abstract metaphors outweigh visceral reality; offers distinctive voice but strains under word limit's compression of emotional progression</comment>
