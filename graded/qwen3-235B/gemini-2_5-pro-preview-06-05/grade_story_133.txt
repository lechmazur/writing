<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Characters are distinct and purposeful, but motivations remain slightly underexplored; Lyra’s menace and Alistair’s jadedness drive interactions, but their emotional depths lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on taut dialogue and symbolic gestures, but the abrupt resolution feels underdeveloped; the pottery class setting strains credibility as a locus for espionage despite its narrative efficiency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (citrus, clay) establish mood, but the labyrinth orchard and colonial town setting remain superficial, serving atmosphere over narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and layered dialogue create subtext; the ending’s thematic punch (“clay quality”) resonates, though some exchanges border on overwrought symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with inventive worldbuilding (rooftop orchard, royal Hunters) but occasionally falters into ornate phrasing; Lyra’s dialogue feels calculated, not organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a polished vignette but lack transformative originality; the tight structure works, but emotional impact feels restrained by formal precision.</comment>
