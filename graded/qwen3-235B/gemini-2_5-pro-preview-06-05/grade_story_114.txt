<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character exhibits inconsistent motivations; apathy jars with reef-building dedication. Nuanced reactions to objects/concepts lack depth, but assigned traits like laziness shape passive actions effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear plot functions but lacks tension or stakes. Action progression is logical but feels procedurally mechanical rather than narratively dynamic within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere creates dreamlike texture but fails to make environmental elements interactive. Sensory details are evocative in isolation yet feel disconnected from character/object logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical framework provides intellectual impact through ecological parable. Effective imagery and conceptual symbolism elevate craft, though emotional resonance remains surface-level rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphor layering is inventive, but "gentle sharpness" and river wisdom risk platitudes. Object-attribute relationships feel occasionally contrived rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but execution leaves narrative silos. Some elements feel forcibly reconciled rather than synergistically integrated, though thematic ambition shows promise.</comment>
