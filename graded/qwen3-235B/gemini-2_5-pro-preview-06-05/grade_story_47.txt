<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's duality—eager curiosity vs. jaded servitude—is hinted at but lacks deeper exploration; her emotional shift toward the end feels abrupt rather than earned, weakening the resolution's impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The progression from phones to final note is cohesive, but pacing stumbles in compressing time-jumps; the loop from initial resentment to catharsis feels truncated despite strong cause-effect logic in the puzzle-box plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (softened glove leather, tapping dancer's soundscape) anchor the decaying theater's melancholy, though "soundless sanctuary" blurs atmospheric intent in scenes requiring tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (chains as front-row seats, joke as mortality-rejection) resonate; the ending's emotional economy—laughter as catharsis—transcends typical "belated forgiveness" tropes through precise, understated physicality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in voice-note clues and mortality-as-absurdist-legacy, but phrases like "graceless beauty" occasionally veer toward self-conscious prose; subversion of "dying mentor" clichés elevates it above formulaic writing.</comment>
