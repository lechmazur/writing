<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to defy genetic limitations is clear, tied to fire trauma, but inner conflict lacks depth. Elara's actions align with traits, but "sweetly fierce" voice lacks sustained distinctness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows from performance to walkie-talkie pivot, but pacing feels slightly rushed in emotional transitions. Beginning/end cohesion is strong; cosmic timeframe strains logical connection to climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive: damp decay of underground city contrasts with glimmering illusions. Vivid sensory details (bioluminescent flora, phantom flame) deepen emotional resonance and thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (fan as mediation tool, fire as inherited trauma) are layered. The ending's fragile hope avoids trite resolution while maintaining subtext about art's power. Show-don't-tell executed masterfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in blending fairy lore with cosmic longing, but "failing theme park" leans trope-adjacent. Some flowery prose ("sweetly fierce grace") and abrupt walkie-talkie reveal hint at mild algorithmic influence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate well thematically but unevenly in mechanics; the walkie-talkie subplot feels tangential. Limited word count handles emotional beats effectively, but structural ambition exceeds tight constraints.</comment>
