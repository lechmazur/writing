<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weak interiority; motivation is clear but character remains an archetype. Actions align with traits but lack psychological depth. Distinct voice absent in third-person limited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mechanical plot progression through map/yearbook integration. Pacing strained by compressed arc but maintains cohesion. Climactic resolution aligns with timeframe. Over-reliance on deus ex machina dance logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally hollow setting. Sensory details prioritize style over visceral immersion. Atmosphere supports theme but lacks tangible stakes beyond metaphorical preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious with kinetic metaphor and symbolic resonance. Undermined by explanatory dialogue-free narration. Theme of cultural preservation surfaces through gesture rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally lapses into mythic abstraction. Some phrases ("jaded wonder") feel performative. Character reasoning relies on symbolic logic over organic motivation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenly. Sensory economy prioritizes wonder over emotional authenticity. Lingers conceptually but lacks visceral emotional imprint.</comment>
