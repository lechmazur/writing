<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict; motivations are stated but not deeply explored. The character's distinct voice is present but overshadowed by excessive metaphorical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linear ritual progression builds methodically to a thematic payoff. Some rushed transitions between gathering components and execution, but overall logical throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Sensory cohesion is meticulous—quantum duality manifests in every detail (glass/crystal sand, mercury-stained pools). Atmosphere perfectly amplifies existential tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is poetically dense with fresh metaphors (e.g., "supernova's first cry") that deepen the theme. Ending's tragic irony resonates. Occasionally risks overloading with abstractions like "corroded rapture."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in concept but follows familiar Frankensteinian trope without subverting it. Some repetitive phrasing ("quantum beach," "crystallized paradox") approaches formulaic. Emotional impact felt through imagery more than character depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements feel organically interwoven—particularly the quantum beach's instability mirroring the summoner's psyche. Ambition's cost as a lingering thematic question elevates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
