<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations inferred through abstract concepts like 'cosmic plea' rather than human-scale reasoning. Trait of rebellion feels cursory, not integrated into her current identity as a prophet.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Non-linear chronology creates thematic unity (laundromat to giant's study) but pacing lurches between memory and present action. Ending lacks concrete resolution to story’s intellectual promise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eerie sensory contrast between mundane laundromat and mythic study works; 'inkwell as dark lake' and 'feather from mythological bird' provide visceral texture. Too much visual grandeur displaces emotional weight of her isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imagery ('city of minds desperate for shared signal') creates haunting existential resonance. Metaphors maintain cohesion but occasionally veer into abstraction without tethering to character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Occasionally succumbs to ornate abstraction ('cathedral of thought') but avoids outright cliché through specific details like ozone-scented paper flower. Emotional stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in its mytho-poetic logic but sacrifices intimate character engagement for atmospheric sweep. Lingers as a half-realized parable about connection rather than a fully embodied narrative.</comment>
