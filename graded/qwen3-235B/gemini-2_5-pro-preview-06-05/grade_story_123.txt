<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth beneath poetic exterior; motivation clearly stated but mostly unexplored through action beyond literal brewing. The "eager brewer" trait manifests weakly in character behavior despite strong thematic connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through symbolic brewing process but lacks significant tension or character-driven conflict; the arc feels abbreviated rather than deliberately constrained, with resolution arriving too neatly for emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through dust, stale air, groaning metal; atmosphere masterfully reinforces both decay and latent potential. The fractured dome as celestial framing device exemplifies profound setting-character interplay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Imagery ("ale was life") and symbolic moss creation carry powerful subtext about ecological renewal and inherited legacy; ending's emotional duality resonates beyond surface narrative. Occasional over-reliance on abstract descriptors slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some "dying constellations" type phrases border on poetic tropes, but the brewing-as-reclamation concept feels fresh. Emotional progression relies too heavily on explicit statements about sadness/joy rather than earned through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story achieves atmospheric unity while struggling with its own ambition within space constraints. Elements create thematic harmony, but the miniature scale leaves plot and character development under-realized despite potent emotional aftertaste.</comment>
