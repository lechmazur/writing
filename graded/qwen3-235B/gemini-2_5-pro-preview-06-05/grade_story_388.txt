<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (muse's silence) is clear but lacks psychological depth; reactions feel archetypal rather than personally nuanced. The profession "melodic sculptor" isn't fully integrated into distinct behavioral traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot uses the road trip and glade meeting as efficient scaffolding, but emotional arc resolution feels abrupt. Time compression works against deeper exploration of the transformative moment; cause-effect logic holds but lacks narrative gravity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful sensory density in the glade's moss/lavender-scented coldness and "shouting silence" creates immersion. Atmospheric consistency wavers during transition from studio to forest; urban environment lacks comparable vividness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical resonance between musical creativity and botanical instrumentation elevates surface narrative. Resolution feels intellectually satisfying but emotionally distant; thematic "listening for forgotten music" resonates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps - botanical music-making has genuine originality. Some phrases ("ancient twisted trees whispering") border on aesthetic clich√©s but aren't overused. Emotional arc stays understated through environment rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative rather than vice versa, though "peculiarly reliable" legend element remains underexploited. Tight word count sacrifices character intimacy and transformational logic, but atmospheric cohesion persists beyond immediate plot.</comment>
