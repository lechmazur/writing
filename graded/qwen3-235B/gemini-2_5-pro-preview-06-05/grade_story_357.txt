<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's solitude and need for control are well-established, but motivation to 'triumph over despair' lacks emotional depth. Dialogue attempts to convey duality of 'flippancy/earnestness' but feels performative, not organically explored through distinct voice or nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs from reluctant participation to gamble mirrors emotional journey, but pacing in board game structure feels artificial (rounds lack unique stakes). Causality between dice rolls/emotional fragility is implied rather than dramatized, weakening tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively uses cold motifs (frost, brittle rose, 'predator's shadow') but lacks sensory specifics. The Frost Giant's lair-as-metaphor is conceptually strong yet under-realized in physical setting details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (despair as predator, solitude as weapon) elevate themes. The final sacrifice resonates emotionally, but relies on telling rather than embodied tension (e.g., 'tremor in soul' is abstract). Memorable use of game mechanics as emotional scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some overused phrases ('blade's edge,' 'starve the beast') undercut originality. Board game framing avoids clich√©s about social gatherings; the 'cold cavern in chest' metaphor is fresh. Emotional progression feels genuine, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution: the black rose and despair-as-predator are compelling, while 'seldom odd' and Frost Giant's lair feel tacked on. Ending's emotional payoff justifies the brevity.</comment>
