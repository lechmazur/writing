<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Core traits (regret, sacrifice) are clear but lack deeper exploration of his internal conflicts beyond surface-level longing. Motivation drives action cohesively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear introspection fits the word limit, but the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic coherence. Pacing is taut but leaves some emotional beats underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered (storm, lighthouse), but sensory details (e.g., "storm-slicked lantern glass") lack variety. Setting-as-isolation is effective but minimally expanded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (sorrow as pilgrimage, artifacts as love’s preservation) achieve poetic resonance. The ending balances catharsis and ambiguity. Subtext about valuing regret enriches impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; metaphors like "cancer in his soul" risk cliché, but the star-sign pattern as symbolic logic feels original. Emotional nuance outweighs explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively around a singular thematic question. Some abstract descriptions (e.g., "joyful agony") lean on paradox rather than embodied experience, diluting realism.</comment>
