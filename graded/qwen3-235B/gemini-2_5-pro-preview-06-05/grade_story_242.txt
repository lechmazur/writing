<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge cultures is clear but underexplored; her shift in loyalty is abrupt, lacking emotional nuance despite effective use of the "mirthful solemnity" voice in key moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from operator to clandestine follower but feels rushed in character transformation; the revolution-through-tea concept is elegant but resolving the conflict in one scene strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details (chamomile scent, neon-dampened streets) create immersion, but worldbuilding feels superficial—sectors and "last truth" concept lack concrete historical or cultural texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (Unity Tea as unifier) and the bridge motif create thematic resonance; ending's blend of mischief/gravity lands well, but emotional beats rely partly on stated loyalty shifts rather than fully realized character psychology.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (sectors-as-tribes reframed through shared ritual), but phrases like "quiet chaos" and "fractured cultures" risk formulaic abstraction; character nuance exists but competes with occasionally ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements like the booth and herbs integrate cohesively, though the "rarely frequent" descriptor becomes plot device rather than thematic anchor; concept density occasionally overwhelms emotional clarity.</comment>
