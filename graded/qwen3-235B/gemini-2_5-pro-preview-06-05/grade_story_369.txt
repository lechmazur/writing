<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (spiritual development through puzzles) is clear but lacks emotional depth. His fanatical obsession is hinted at but not fully unpacked; reactions to the puzzle feel archetypal rather than intimate. The "optimistically bitter" voice is present but underdeveloped, leaning on poetic abstraction over authentic interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear progression from puzzle arrival to resolution, but the cyclical nature (empty box = temporary relief) feels simplistic despite the poetic framing. Pacing is controlled but lacks tension; the "conflict" is emotionally static, making the arc feel predetermined rather than earned within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Piercing sensory details (storm's "churn," "damp-smelling cardboard," "click of brass") create an immersive, melancholic world. The lighthouse's isolation and storm mirror Elias's psychological state, though the setting occasionally veers into gothic clich√©s. Atmosphere consistently supports theme, even if execution occasionally overreaches.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (puzzles as penance, string as fragile hope) are potent and layered. The ending's emptiness-as-forgiveness is haunting, subverting expectations while maintaining thematic cohesion. Somber tone is consistent, elevated by precise imagery ("string wriggles like a worm," "weight shifts but doesn't vanish"). Subtext about self-flagellation as spiritual practice lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise (puzzles as ritualized penance) avoids formulaic arcs, but leans on tropes (isolated genius in a lighthouse). Language is lush but occasionally strains for effect ("fractinal lightening," "lethargic excitement"). Emotional nuance is implied through action rather than blunt exposition, though some phrases feel like aestheticized shorthand rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Element integration is mostly cohesive but uneven: the lighthouse and puzzles are indispensable, while the "two fateful letters" framework feels underexplored. The tonal ambition (melancholy-as-mechanism) is clear but occasionally undermines psychological credibility. Leaves aesthetic questions, not thematic urgency, lingering.</comment>
