<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's planning background informs his method, but his internal transformation is summarized rather than evinced. The motivation to dismantle the system is clear, but his emotional state relies more on description than embodied tension through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a contained ritual structure with clear beginning (alarm)/middle (smudging)/end (transformation), but the boardroom deal's consequences remain abstract. Pacing is tense yet feels slightly compressed, compressing years of planning into a single act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually lush with tactile details (smooth ink blotter, phosphorescent pigment) and atmospheric contrasts (ancient temple vs. modern boardroom). Sensory coherence falters slightly with "fractured constellations" - celestial metaphors overwhelm spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in ink blotter as both stabilizing heirloom and destructive tool; ending achieves thematic resonance with "machine set perfectly to task." Deeper exploration of urban decay/systemic betrayal could enhance thematic density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (ink blotter as destructive relic) but relies on AI-typical abstractions ("chains of former life"). Metaphors like "fractured constellations" feel freshly imagined, though "echoing silence" and "cool sandstone" slightly overpolish physicality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>Strong integration of arcane-urban elements; the brief length feels purposeful but sacrifices contextual weight. The "machine" and "ghost" metaphors create lingering conceptual resonance without mawkishness.</comment>
