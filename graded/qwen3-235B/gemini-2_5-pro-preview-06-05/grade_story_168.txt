<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Iris' motivation to decode rock art is clear and consistent with her established precision. The flower-arranger reference is metaphorically effective but underexplored as a defining character trait. Her emotional arc (control vs. overwhelming truth) resonates, though secondary character Leo remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from lichen-scraping to glyph discovery, with cause-effect tied to her obsessive methodology. Time compression works effectively - the single critical moment between verses creates narrative cohesion. Pacing maintains tension throughout, with a complete arc from obsession to revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Excellent atmospheric details - singing voice among monoliths, chill of the stones, textured descriptions of glyph-carving. Stone circle as setting deeply enhances both mystery and melancholy tone. Sensory elements (sound of music, texture of comb) powerfully ground the transcendental revelation in physical reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking symbolism (comb/scars/weeping eye) elevates beyond simple discovery narrative. Metaphors of gardening, archaeology, and musical structure intertwine effectively. The ending's thematic weight about inherited sorrow creates lingering resonance. Tension between control and cosmic truth provides philosophical depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls - metaphors are fresh, emotional beats earned through imagery rather than exposition. Some minor ornate passages ("cold and silent inheritance") verge on purple prose, but overall style serves theme effectively. The intersection of scientific precision and spiritual revelation feels authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically rather than feeling assigned - flower-arranger precision, stone-circle context, and musical timing all prove integral. Combines genre tropes (ancient symbols) with unique emotional approach to create something memorable. The ending suggests eternal vigil rather than resolution, which feels deliberate and thought-provoking.</comment>
