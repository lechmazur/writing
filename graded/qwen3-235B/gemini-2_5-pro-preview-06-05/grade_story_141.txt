<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Superstition and engineering background minimally explored beyond token gestures. Motivation to transcend is stated but inconsistently dramatized through action or introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from encounter to revelation, though scavenger hunt premise feels contrived. Lightning's final act resolves the "space between" timeframe but pacing compresses emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Submarine setting and bioluminescent-free abyss rendered with tactile detail: salt-etched visuals, hull tremors, skeletal light. Atmosphere thickly aligns with existential dread.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Sublime metaphor layers—shipworm quotes, engineer dissolving into thought—create philosophical depth. Ending rewards thought. "Remembering" as transcendence offers haunting closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Few clichés; metaphors (leviathan bones as cavern, storm as "thunder and lightning" timeframe) feel original. Subtext in shedding professional identity avoids formulaic treatments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Element integration strong overall. Scavenger hunt and "women's wisdom" strain cohesion slightly, but poetic notebook's symbolic payoff and atmospheric unity suggest intentional design.</comment>
