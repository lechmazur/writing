<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is partially clear but underdeveloped; the sneer and "rambling destiny" feel surface-level, relying on juxtaposition rather than nuanced internal/external conflict to ground the envoy’s paradoxical duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has forward momentum via the "sift" action and a clear narrative arc (search → discovery), but the 400-word constraint leaves pivotal shifts (e.g., transition to the note’s coordinates) underexplored, creating a sense of brevity over coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding fails to rise above generic dystopian tropes; the "alien plain" and "domed vineyard" lack specific, lived-in details to make the setting integral rather than incidental to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext ("vine remembers the star") elevates the narrative; the ending’s emotional shift from cynicism to awe is subtly earned, though some phrases border on vague poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic writing; imagery like "cup starlight" and "whispers" feels fresh, but the domed greenhouse setting and "disgraced academic" trope flirt with conventionality without full subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly serviceable but not tightly interwoven; some (e.g., timestamp "hush of a possibility") feel arbitrarily placed rather than emerging organically from the story’s logic or themes.</comment>
