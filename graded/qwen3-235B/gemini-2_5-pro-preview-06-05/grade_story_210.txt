<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Finch’s scholarly drive is conceptually clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict; his amiable quality contrasts intriguingly with obsessive focus, though emotional depth remains thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a single revelatory moment with clean structure, but the arc is slight; the payoff feels perfunctory despite tight pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends eerie and academic tones well, with vivid tactile details (e.g., "weathered wood"), though the haunted lighthouse leans on Gothic shorthand rather than innovating.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (resonance as memory) and the bridge between science/superstition elevate the narrative; the crossword callback is clever but doesn’t fully ignite deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional formulaic phrasing ("whispers of the past"); the timbers’ "cellular structure" strains believability, but the fusion of ancient/modern theme avoids cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent execution with a memorable central idea, but lacks narrative urgency and emotional stakes to justify its ambition; feels constrained by tight word limits rather than liberated by them.</comment>
