<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict; zealotry feels intellectualized rather than visceral. Motivation is clear but lacks emotional grounding in the character's physicality or idiosyncratic behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc exists but is structurally thin; the transition from activation to revelation lacks tension. The final epiphany feels preordained rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically inert details (ozone, velvet) overwhelm subtle atmosphere. The juxtaposition of antique and arcane elements creates compelling cognitive dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding around currency as collective prayer, but overreliance on aphoristic declarations weakens emotional immersion. The central theme is potent but occasionally stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avodes formulaic worldbuilding; machine's specifics feel logically engineered. However, phrases like "latent energy" verge on genre abstraction. Subtleties of grief are shown, but political vacuum remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but predictably. The brevity amplifies thematic focus while diluting earned catharsis. Leaves conceptual traces rather than haunting resonance.</comment>
