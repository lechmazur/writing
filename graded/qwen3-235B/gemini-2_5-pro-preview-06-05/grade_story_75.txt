<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation shift but lacks emotional depth; reactions are logical but not deeply nuanced. Stated "angry peace" dominates over shown complexity in internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc exists within constraints, but key transitions (diary discovery to vow-writing) feel accelerated. Coherence maintained, but momentum occasionally sacrificed to compress themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Evocative nano-forest imagery contrasts with abstract "angry peace" tone. Sensory details unevenly distributed â€“ some concepts (engineered forests) better realized than others (emotional states).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor ("gilded cage") and subtext (truth-as-resistance) effectively, but ending relies on familiar rebellion tropes. Writing style serves narrative without achieving poetic distinction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some fresh concepts (coded manifesto) undercut by predictable emotional beats and slightly ornate language ("digital ink of original sin"). Avoids strict formula but shows derivative tendencies in tone and resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved, but elements feel applied rather than organically combined. Premise suggests intriguing themes that exceed word count's capacity for exploration.</comment>
