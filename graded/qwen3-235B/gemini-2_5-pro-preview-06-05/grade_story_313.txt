<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear but underexplored - Silas's con-artist identity dominates surface actions but doesn't deeply intersect with his remorse. Emotional reactions feel consistent but lack layered complexity. The tape dispenser as symbolic prop is intriguing but underutilized for revealing character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular plot structure works within tight constraints but lacks dramatic momentum. The interrogation method shapes internal conflict effectively but externalizes little action. Atmospheric progression is smooth but pivotal character interactions feel static. The "resolution" through ghostly dissolution lacks concrete narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clinical sensory details like "cold polymer floor" and "recycled air" create immersive bleakness. The "unusually normal" ghosts contrasting with dystopian setting provides thematic tension. Atmosphere successfully mirrors psychological states through environmental sterility versus spectral intrusions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like empty dispenser mirroring emotional emptiness are effective. The ending's "quiet rebellion" offers thoughtful subversion of dystopian tropes. Subtext about guilt and identity persistence through spectral interactions is compelling but underdeveloped. Emotional showing vs telling remains balanced but uneven in intensity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrases ("sterile purgatory," "jaw of defeat") border on clich√© but are offset by original ghost portrayal as "smudges on clean window." Emotional nuance in spectral interactions avoids formulaic arcs. Stylistic consistency maintained despite occasional ornate phrasing in psychological descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements combine cohesively but not innovatively - ghosts as conscience devices work but lack narrative surprise. The brevity feels intentional yet slightly restrictive. Final reflection about "shared normalcy" creates memorable thematic resonance, though larger societal critique remains underexplored.</comment>
