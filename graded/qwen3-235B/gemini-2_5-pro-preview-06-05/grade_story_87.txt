<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and tied to the sticker sheet's symbolism, but internalized actions lack externalization beyond clichéd gestures. Nuanced exploration of repressed emotions is undercut by over-reliance on metaphor-as-diagnosis rather than organic behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a contained catharsis arc within tight constraints, but resolution hinges on metaphysical visualization (locking hatred away) that feels abstract compared to concrete sensory elements. Pacing balances introspection with progression, though closure relies heavily on narrative declaration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Steampunk elements function as retrofitted set dressing rather than integrated atmosphere - clockwork waiters and pipes lack thematic connection to emotional machinery. Sensory details present but unevenly weighted; auditory elements (music, hissing) overshadow tactile specifics that could ground the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (parasitic hatred, vault imagery) create vivid internal conflict, but emotional impact diminishes through repeated use of "soundless" and "hollow" abstractions. The subtext of memory-as-reclamation works conceptually, though final line's thematic statement risks didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clichéd emotional landscapes (betrayal, catharsis) undercut by steampunk anachronisms that lack functional purpose. Avoids purple prose but occasionally substitutes mechanical descriptions for organic character revelation. The sticker sheet's integration is inventive, but audio player's brass-inlay feels like aesthetic overkill.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements unite under thematic coherence but sacrifice narrative specificity - could function in alternate reality but lacks distinctive authorial fingerprints. The brevity works against fully realized themes, leaving emotional notes under-resonated despite competent structural cohesion.</comment>
