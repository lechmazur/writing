<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and symbolically rendered; grumpiness is effective but under-explored. The tube's physicality reveals trauma, but internal voice could have more nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from resentment to acceptance, using the sand mandala method coherently. Pacing is deliberate, but the stargazing timeframe feels more atmospheric than structurally essential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystal dome and moon-herbs create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors emotional states. Sensory details enrich setting-character connection, though the witch's absence weakens worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storytelling uses profound metaphor (sand as trauma) and evocative imagery. The ending resonates thematically, though the final "murmur" risks understating the transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements synergize with theme and characterâ€”each feels indispensable in creating psychological depth. The mandala method in particular unifies the narrative.</comment>
