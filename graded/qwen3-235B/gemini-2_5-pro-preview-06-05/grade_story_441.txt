<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's philosophical motivation is conceptually clear but lacks lived-in specificity; existential musings feel performative rather than organically integrated into concrete actions or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains momentum through vivid set-pieces but struggles with coherence - flash mob interruption lacks narrative weight, emotional climax feels narratively unearned by preceding action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Particle accelerator setting masterfully rendered through tactile details (temperature, vibration) and existential scale, though thematic connection to human-scale heartbreak remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric density (particle collisions as emotional resonance) and poetic imagery elevate the narrative, but ending falters through abstract generalities rather than earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original sensory metaphors and structural boldness (philosopher-meets-scientist in Hadron Collider cathedral) largely avoid clich√©, though some phrase choices betray literary mannerisms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story coalesces around its central metaphor despite structural contrivances, creating lingering resonance through juxtaposition of cosmic scale and intimate loss.</comment>
