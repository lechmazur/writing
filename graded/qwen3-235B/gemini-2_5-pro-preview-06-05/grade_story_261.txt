<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation drives action but lacks emotional complexity; archetypal bitterness and irony dominate over nuanced inner conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from decay to solution, but the ink-to-resolution leap feels overly convenient. Tight pacing works effectively despite minor contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting relies too heavily on jargon (quantum petals, chrono-flora) over visceral, immersive details; tone/setting friction is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Radiant metaphors (e.g., chaos vs. sterile control) and ironic reversal elevate the narrative; thematically cohesive and poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original concept execution is strong, but some phrases (“shimmering, dying waves”) edge on florid. Avoids generic tropes with inventive fusion of organic/mechanistic elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically rich whole. Conceptual daring and irony linger, though structural polish is uneven.</comment>
