<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Implied depth in guilt over fatal flaws, but internal psychology remains more symbolic than viscerally felt. Motivation drives action but feels intellectually rendered rather than emotionally embodied through lived, nuanced struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum stunted by overly schematic structure: setup→experiment→transformation→emotional climax. Pacing unevenly balances poetic description with character-driven causality in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visceral atmospheric decay anchors the story, but the setting's futuristic elements lack integration with emotional core. Server room hum and maggot imagery create powerful mood that occasionally overshadows narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally undercut impact, yet metaphor of mending through softening delivers haunting thematic echoes. Transformation of shards into sphere is poignant, ending resonates with restrained symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some overwritten descriptors ("digital heartbeat in concrete corpse") flirt with pretension, but overall inventiveness subverts sci-fi redemption tropes. Subtext about rigidity vs. adaptability avoids pat resolution, prioritizing mood over formula.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Elements cohere aesthetically but psychological depth suffers under stylistic weight. Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional delivery; themes linger intellectually rather than haunting viscerally. Technical brevity serves mood more than character revelation.</grade>
