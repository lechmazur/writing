<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity is central but underdeveloped beyond her persistence; her mortician background doesn't meaningfully shape her deeper motivations or emotional responses, limiting psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but relies on abrupt shifts (footprints) that feel somewhat convenient; resolution is thematically resonant but sacrifices tension for poetic closure within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative, layered atmosphere merges sensory details with metaphysical elements; the mangrove's shifting geography and "polite anarchy" enhance thematic resonance through immersive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Beautifully crafted prose with layered symbolism (e.g., bracelet as tuning fork) elevates the narrative; the ending's thematic weight (continuity of stories) lingers, though emotional payoff remains reserved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing in setting and metaphors but occasionally leans on familiar mystical tropes; the vanishing footprints device feels fresh, while the "library of souls" concept lacks radical reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade>  
<comment>Coherent, thematically unified despite brevity; each element shapes the narrative arc meaningfully, though some (e.g., timeframe) serve atmosphere over plot mechanics.</comment>
