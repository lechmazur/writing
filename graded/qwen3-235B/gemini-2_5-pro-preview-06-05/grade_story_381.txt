<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "hushed necromancer" are underexplored, with little connection to actions beyond superficial tech/magic elements. Motivation (mapping) is clear but lacks emotional depth, weakening the impact of the resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear three-act compression within the limit; the action (domination vs. connection) drives momentum. Logical cause-effect (movie homage → AI cooperation) feels slightly convenient but is serviceable for the scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid crystalline imagery and resonant soundscapes create mood, but the setting’s link to the necromancer’s skills is unexplored. "Futuristic nostalgia" lacks layered execution, relying on surface-level references.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of cooperation vs. control resonate through subtle show-don’t-tell gestures (tugging cap, clicking spire). The ending’s shift from threat to symphony elevates emotional impact, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Refreshingly avoids AI-as-antagonist tropes. Synthesis of old-movie warmth in a crystalline system feels inventive. Some phrasing (e.g., "digital ghost") borders on cliché but doesn’t undermine originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Most elements (necromancy, baseball cap, scarse echoes) feel functional rather than integral. The tight word limit amplifies pacing but leaves thematic threads underdeveloped, reducing overall cohesion.</comment>
