<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivations are clear but occasionally feel summarized rather than organically revealed; the interplay between legal cunning and linguistic preservation is compelling yet lacks deeper exploration of psychological conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong but compressed; the inciting incident to resolution progression is logical, though the short word limit leaves some narrative transitions feeling abrupt rather than elegantly streamlined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like synthetic sun, golden vapor, and whispering create atmosphere, but the biodome's integration with character psychology and plot mechanics could be more symbiotic; some descriptions border on generic futuristic tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("taut wire," "dying words") and thematic resonance between language preservation and systemic defiance elevate impact; the ending balances resolution with lingering tension, though some emotional beats could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subverts genre expectations with linguistic preservation as penance and legal maneuvering via atmospheric manipulation; avoids clich√©s conceptually but occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("ghostly resolve") that slightly dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements suggests deliberate craft, though the short form occasionally privileges concept over emotional immersion; the synthesis of trickster logic, coded defiance, and cultural erasure lingers effectively.</comment>
