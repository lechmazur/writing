<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weakly defined motivations; archivist's shift from wariness to resolve feels unearned. Kael's "energetically lethargic" facade lacks integration with his calculated manipulation. Dialogue reveals more than character actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Exposition-heavy progression; terminal's data revelation feels like deus ex machina. Pacing accelerates abruptly from philosophical tension to sudden alliance. The "lock about to give way" metaphor is literal and narrative miscalibration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid decay-as-rebirth imagery in orchard/skyscraper juxtaposition. Sensory details (whispering leaves, glowing diagnostics) create immersive post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Insufficient exploration of how reclaimed space influences character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness in pricing truth, but emotional impact diluted by heavy-handed allegory. The terminal's "screaming truth" lacks narrative sophistication. Dialogue achieves poetic tension without descending into soliloquy. Final handshake lacks earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original use of reclaimed nature and decaying tech avoids dystopian clichés. Some purple prose ("honey-dipped poison") undermines subtlety. Archivist's transformation follows human patterns but lacks interiority. The price tag's economic metaphor feels thoughtfully subversive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Functional cohesion exists between elements but lacks transcendent synthesis. Word count constrains deeper exploration of systemic corruption. Lingering impact weak—theme declaration replaces nuanced thematic unfolding through action.</comment>
