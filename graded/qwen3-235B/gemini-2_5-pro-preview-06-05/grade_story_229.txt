<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation (honoring a promise) is clear but lacks emotional depth. Actions align with curiosity and grief, but character history beyond Lyra's secret remains underdeveloped. First-person narration could have deepened voice but wasn't used.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from setup to emotional payoff, with rain-to-resonance sequence tightly structured. The ending's poetic resolution works within word limits, though the method's scientific plausibility remains under-explained. No abrupt shifts, but pacing of middle section relies heavily on exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly constructed through sensory details (salt air, skeletal ships, rain's texture) that mirror thematic concerns. The cosmic tone interacts meaningfully with the graveyard setting, making memory feel physically tangible. Connection between objects (ring box, rain) and world-building strengthens immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (rain as archival medium, resonance as emotion) elevate the narrative beyond literal plot. Ending avoids sentimentality by making love itself the secret rather than words. Subtext about memory's physicality resonates deeply. Some "showing" diluted by explanatory phrasing ("a feeling that bloomed directly in her chest").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses fresh conceit (acoustic memory in rain) but occasionally veers toward ornate language ("color of old bruises"). Emotional stakes feel genuine rather than formulaic, though the cosmic intimacy tone occasionally strains credibility. Avoids major AI markers like repetitive phrasing, but atmospheric descriptions occasionally lean on familiar poetic devices rather than wholly original comparisons.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly despite word constraints, creating cumulative emotional weight. The brevity feels intentional, with every detail (ship graveyard textures, the ring box's materiality) serving the theme. Conveys lingering wonder about time's persistence rather than merely executing assigned components.</comment>
