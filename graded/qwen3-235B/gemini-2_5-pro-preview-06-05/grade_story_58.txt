<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict shown; loyalty is stated but not deeply explored through action or nuance. Motivation for radicalization lacks emotional grounding despite consistent behavioral alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from quiet observation to coded activation, but abrupt shift from joke to apocalyptic tension lacks psychological build. Pacing feels compressed in key emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Moths as metaphor for collective obsession is visually potent. Sensory details (powdery wings, stuttering light) create unease but some atmospheric elements border on overwrought symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chilling subtext about hidden radicalization in media. Moth imagery resonates thematically; ending's juxtaposition of meditation and impending violence creates haunting irony. Subtlety in emotional delivery strengthens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original framing of coded propaganda as comedy. Avoids trope-heavy AI phrasing through precise metaphors ("holy terror of his purpose") and unusual juxtaposition of devotion with systemic terrorism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Elements cohere narratively but with mechanical precision rather than organic urgency. The moth motif connects premise to metaphor, yet some details (e.g. radio joke structure) feel conceptually derivative despite fresh execution.</comment>
