<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's 'nondescript' trait is underexplored; motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth. First-person voice is distinct but psychological complexity is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is logical but pacing is uneven—the resolution feels rushed within the word limit. Cause-effect logic holds but emotional payoff lacks weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with sensory details, but setting (control tower/post-party) feels disconnected from thematic purpose. Timeframe’s relevance remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and lyrical style elevate craft, but ending’s tonal shift to bureaucratic banality undercuts emotional resonance. Subtext exists but lacks cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Few clichés; similes are fresh (e.g., encryption as "thorny data-vines"). Some over-explanation (e.g., "innocent cynicism") weakens subtlety. Stylistic confidence evident.</comment>
