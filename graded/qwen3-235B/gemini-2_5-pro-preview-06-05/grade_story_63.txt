<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid but motivation feels underexplored; internal conflict between preservationist drive and emotional restraint remains implied rather than dramatized. Assigned attribute of "reserved oracle" lacks integration with tactile, sensory work described.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot follows mending process but lacks meaningful stakes; cyclical structure works but feels insular. Logical gaps in methods (ghost sounds materializing through embroidery) undercut coherence despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is dazzlingly original with sensory details (brass funnels, floral wallpaper) though the choir's thematic connection to preservation could be better emphasized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic craftsmanship elevates quiet tension between fragility and permanence. Symbolism (unraveling stitch = lost history) resonates. Subtext about unseen labor's legacy is powerful, undercut slightly by overly neat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional ornate abstraction ("silk the color of twilight") that distracts from concrete action. Emotional beats feel genuine but some atmospheric elements risk preciousness over organic development.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Fits assigned elements tightly but asymmetricallyâ€”some (cuffs, lab setting) deeply integrated while others (choir practice timeframe) feel tacked onto atmosphere rather than driving narrative. Cumulative impact memorable despite uneven seams.</comment>
