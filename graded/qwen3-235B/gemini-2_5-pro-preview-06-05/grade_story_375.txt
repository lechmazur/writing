<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character motivation; inner conflict is alluded to but not developed. Actions don't fully reveal nuanced psychology, relying heavily on abstract descriptors rather than tangible behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses linearly but feels compressed; climax feels abrupt. Method using mannequins isn't logically explained within the world's internal physics. Some cause-effect clarity missing in sabotage mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (catwalks, pulsing energy). Atmosphere effectively contrasts "celestial rage" with fragile decay. Timeframe's ambiguity slightly weakens temporal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism of cosmic flaws as rebellion against order is conceptually rich. Ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional payoff. Some telling ("angry peace") undercuts show-don't-tell. Memorable imagery but uneven emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by stock phrases ("silent towers," "celestial rage"). Avoids clich√©s but occasionally becomes pretentious. Tone shifts between lyrical and clinical; metaphors like "ghost in the machine" feel derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce but lack organic integration. Theme of imperfection is clear but not deeply interrogated. Writing is technically proficient but lacks the transformative urgency implied by cosmic stakes. Lingering thought is superficial without philosophical heft.</comment>
