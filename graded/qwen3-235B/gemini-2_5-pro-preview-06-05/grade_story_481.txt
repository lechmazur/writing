<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character exhibits some traits and motivation alignment (cartography informing mapping, dictionary use revealing nostalgia) but lacks psychological depth or nuanced development; transformation feels abrupt despite thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through sound-driven action but pivotal character realizations occur without meaningful buildup, disrupting pacing; symbolic elements compensate for rushed narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting excels through sensory contrasts (sterile vs. coded rebellion), but integration of futuristic hospital elements (cryo-pods, data-cores) occasionally strains plausibility despite atmospheric richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism elevates theme; metaphors for memory and identity resonate; lacks sustained emotional weight for secondary characters; closure feels earned but under-earned emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise with strong individualized details (dictionary's dragonfly) but relies on genre tropes (sterile dystopias, rebel coders); tone occasionally veers into self-conscious "poetic" abstraction without sufficient thematic anchoring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of key elements creates thematic unity; shorter segments occasionally prioritize concept over emotional cadence; lingers conceptually but not viscerally.</comment>
