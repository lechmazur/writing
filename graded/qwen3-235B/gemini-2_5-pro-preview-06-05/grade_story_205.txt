<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's traits (delicate warrior, cynical) shape actions and voice effectively, but lacks deeper introspection or complexity to fully transcend archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent and concise, but the mystical cause-effect logic (seaweed infusion causing magical resonance) feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Swamp's sensory details and fireflies create vivid atmosphere, but the "end of a line nobody wants to cross" framing remains underexplored and vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and ironic subversion of hero tropes elevate impact, but lacks sustained emotional weight beneath its whimsical surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Highly original and avoids clich√©s; prose is purposeful but occasionally verges on ornate. Subtext about absurdity resisting despair is nuanced and fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a tightly crafted vignette with thematic resonance, though its brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of concept and character.</comment>
