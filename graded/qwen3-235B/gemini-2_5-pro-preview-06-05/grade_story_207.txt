<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's forthrightness is stated rather than demonstrated, and his internal conflict about the oath lacks emotional depth despite clear surface-level motivation; the dried bouquet reveals some of his past but doesn't fully illuminate his psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear structure functions but feels compressed - the discovery of the monastery feels abrupt despite setup, though the symbolic division of the bouquet provides a coherent emotional endpoint within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered (sterile bay, cosmic hum) but underutilizes the medical setting's potential resonance with healing oaths and sterile consequences; sensory details often impressive but occasionally arbitrary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (e.g., "bright clear dawn of final journey") enhance thematic unity; the subtext of fractured oaths manifesting through physical division works powerfully, though emotional stakes remain somewhat abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids obvious tropes but occasionally lapses into lyrical abstraction rather than precise imagery; character reasoning shows nuance through actions more than internal monologue, and language balances poetic restraint against occasional ornate flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole despite uneven character depth; the concise format serves its redemptive arc concept effectively while leaving questions about the broader galactic context unresolved.</comment>
