<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; actions are consistent but remain abstract, favoring philosophical premise over human dimension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves thematic coherence through circular structure but lacks narrative urgency; the brief interaction creates resonance but feels more like a vignette than a complete arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with cosmic imagery and sensory details, though the nebula setting's symbolic weight occasionally overwhelms its functional role in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses layered metaphors (zipper, cosmic duality) to explore individuality vs collectivism; emotional impact is subdued but intellectually engaging, with prose that favors poetic abstraction over visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fresh premise with folklore-as-rebellion avoids clich√© but occasionally slips into ornate language; maintains stylistic consistency while avoiding overt formulaic patterns, though some phrases ('fragile energy') border on familiar abstraction.</comment>
