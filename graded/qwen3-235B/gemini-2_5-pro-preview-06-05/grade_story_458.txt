<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited by brevity, but the pilot's secular spirituality and preservationist drive are coherently established. The coat button's symbolic weight is clear, though internal conflict is somewhat generalized rather than deeply individuated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots effectively on the coffee-stain reading and obliterating act. Pacing is taut, though the terminal's symbolic weight overshadows mechanical cause-effect logic. The decision-to-action tempo succeeds despite constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (rust taste, silence's weight) create immersive decay. The baggage claim's stagnation mirrors the pilot's existential stasis. Atmosphere consistently reinforces thematic melancholy and stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Subtly layered metaphors (fractal sorrow, bridge-as-weapon) elevate the narrative. The ending's moral ambiguity and thematic resonance transcend genre tropes. Sparse yet evocative prose lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in blending secular mysticism and galactic politics shines. A few phrases ("unsalvageable data-screech") tip toward tech-poetic abstraction. Emotional nuance avoids explicit stating, but moments trend toward ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully woven into a thematically unified whole. The story's economy enhances its focus, though deeper exploration of secondary concepts could strengthen cohesion. Lingering questions about sacrifice's consequences enhance resonance.</comment>
