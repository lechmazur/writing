<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mei's placid nature is consistent but under-explored; her motivations are clear but lack emotional complexity despite elegant integration of traits with actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels slightly compressed; the central action is cohesive, but the transformation of prophecy lacks tangible cause-effect escalation within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (silk, orchid pollen, tea) immerse the reader, but cultural specifics of the palace setting remain superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (whispers as pollen, prophecy as crystalline light) and thematic resonance (fate vs. possibility) elevate the narrative, though emotional engagement is secondary to aesthetic beauty.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending assassination with botanical magic, though occasional ornate phrasing ("humming with imminent judgment") risks veering into purple prose. Subverts genre tropes cleverly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clever integration of elements creates cohesion, but the brevity leaves thematic underdevelopment; the reflective aftertaste is mild rather than haunting.</comment>
