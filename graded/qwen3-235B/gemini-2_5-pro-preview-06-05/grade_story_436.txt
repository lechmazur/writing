<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation (reconnecting with Oracle) but emotional depth remains surface-level; "sorrowful apothecary" traits primarily descriptive rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions beyond desperation</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crucible-like structure with ticking-clock urgency works well; bifurcated incense creates inherent tension that resolves elegantly; pacing within constraints is masterful despite minimal exposition</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gorgeous isolated visuals (floating fortress, shimmering deserts) under-developed thematically; sensory details around scent are potent but temporal/spatial logic under-explored (e.g., how an exiled culture sustains a library)</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Piercing metaphor of scent-as-memorial-fragment elevates the narrative; tension between grief/memory is palpable; endingâ€™s near-whisper of a response avoids melodrama while deepening mystery</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids AI-tropes in symbolic synthesis (geode dust/plastic spoon juxtaposition), but some phrases flirt with abstraction ("latent power," "painful joy"). Emotional subtext primarily through objects not psychological interiority</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements serve story cohesively despite density; minor seams visible in mythic framework's underdevelopment. Style serves atmosphere without drawing attention; open-endedness feels intentional but could leave some unsatisfied</comment>
