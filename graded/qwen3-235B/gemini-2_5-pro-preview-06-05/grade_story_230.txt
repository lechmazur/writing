<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Compassion is stated but underexplored in actions; motivation for excavation is emotionally resonant but lacks nuanced development of personal stakes beyond generational trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot mechanics hinge on abstract metaphysical concepts without clear logic; emotional climax feels earned, but the tight word count exacerbates underdeveloped cause-effect connections in the ritual execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (e.g., corroded rivets, "grime-mingled tears") and blend of arcane/espionage settings evoke a cohesive mood, but the submarine's symbolic weight feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("psychic tempest," "jagged submarine section") and the bittersweet resolution create emotional resonance; the "legacy of love" twist avoids saccharine execution through visceral physicality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on archaic descriptors ("century-long anchor") and vague magic systems weakens authenticity; some phrasing ("hopeful brutality") verges on self-indulgent abstraction rather than earned thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper interconnectivity (e.g., "precisely messy" archives don't significantly influence plot); the submarine-hull method feels more symbolic than narratively functional.</comment>
