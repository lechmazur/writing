<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While Elian’s grief and ritual are consistent with the troubadour’s mournful persona, deeper psychological nuance is absent; his motivation drives the plot but lacks layered emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear ritual-to-revelation arc, but the tight word count leaves the middle static; cause-and-effect (soundlessness revealing heartbeat) is logical but the progression feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The anechoic chamber’s oppressive silence and visual interplay of dust and light are vividly rendered; the timeframe of “silent struggles” is underdeveloped but atmospheric cohesion is strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (dust as “notes in a song only silence could hear”) and the existential twist elevate the story, though occasional overwrought phrasing (“academic study of his soul’s acoustics”) slightly undermines subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The chamber and dust-tracking method avoid clichés, but overly ornate descriptions (“constellation of forgotten flowers”) risk feeling artificial; emotional beats are shown, yet the final revelation leans on expected grief resolution tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements are woven into the narrative, but some—like the collar’s significance—require deeper integration; the brevity sacrifices character depth for poetic abstraction, making the ending feel slightly prescribed.</comment>
