<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Limited emotional nuance in static protagonist; internal conflict between cynicism and hope is potent yet under-explained. Distinct voice anchors the piece but lacks humanizing contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tension sustains through ritualistic action, but the cyclical structure (trying again tomorrow) weakens narrative closure. Pacing remains immersive within brief scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering (ozone tang, shivering dust) creates tangible longing. Setting's symbolism—lighthouse as tomb of memory—elevates tone beyond mere atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Braided metaphors (dust as memory, brass rings as temporal anchors) create haunting resonance. Ending refuses catharsis, leaving thematic weight of failed connection lingering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subverts scientific mysticism trope through tactile specificity. Some phrases flirt with preciousness ("whispering dust") but overall avoids artificiality. Emotional restraint feels deliberate, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity without feeling contrived. Style's lyrical precision complements concept but may overwhelm subtler emotional truths in shorter format.</comment>
