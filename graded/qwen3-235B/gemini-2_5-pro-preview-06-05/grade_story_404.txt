<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters exist functionally but lack psychological complexity; Jin’s cynical warmth is surface-level motive projection rather than deeply integrated characterization. Proprietor’s grief feels conceptually assigned rather than emotionally earned within constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Constrained yet coherent narrative arc; the cause-effect chain (key → music box → portal) operates logically but the compressed arc compresses emotional beats artificially, making trust-building feel narratively expedient rather than organically paced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually vivid through ozone smell, shuddering door, and static-thick atmosphere; the juxtaposition of mechanical repair with cosmic sorrow creates intriguing contrast, though the "radical change" timeframe remains abstract ornamentation rather than integrated setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents about grief-as-energy and transactional empathy resonate, but metaphorical layers remain on an elegant-surface level. Ending satisfies intellectually but lacks visceral impact. Subtext about commodified silence vs. sound is compelling yet superficially developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some AI-like phrasing ("crushing’s finality as catharsis," "cold sorrow embedded in metal") leans on poetic abstraction over specificity. Emotional transitions lack subtle psychological nuances. The "haunted melodies" concept feels borrowed from existing speculative tropes without unique reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Compelling fusion of mystical and mechanical elements within tight word limits; emotional economy aids brevity’s strengths while constraining deeper thematic exploration. Lingering questions about grief-as-technical-problem offer conceptual intrigue but lack narrative permanence.</comment>
