<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; the juxtaposition of "frantic cook" with archaeological rigor creates tension but lacks depth in how his role as a cook meaningfully shapes his obsession or methods.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from revelation to climax, but the word limit forces rushed exposition; the central twist feels impactful despite compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is serviceable, blending sterile technology with ancient mystery, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently tied to emotional stakes or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of suppressed truths and cosmic horror evoke thought, with evocative metaphors (e.g., tremors as language), though some ideas are stated rather than embedded in action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar apocalypse-forewarning tropes; the walking stick’s "script" offers a fresh hook, while the "slumbering intelligence" veers toward overused mythos.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain under scrutiny; the story’s ambition outpaces its execution, leaving some components (e.g., the cook’s credibility) underjustified.</comment>
