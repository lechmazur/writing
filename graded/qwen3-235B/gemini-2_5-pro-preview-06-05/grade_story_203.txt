<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (freeing family from ancestral lies), but emotional stakes feel underdeveloped despite visceral descriptions of fear. Actions align with assigned traits, but nuance in showing rather than stating "reluctant exorcist" status would strengthen impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight plot within limitations: ghost confrontation drives progression. Submerging flowers as climax works cohesively, though inherited lies' setup feels compressed. Pacing falters slightly during inciting ritual details, but resolution's emotional weight anchors the arc effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orbital decay details like recycling systems create atmosphere, but green Earth imagery remains abstract. Strong contrasts between cold technology and organic memories exist, though sensory immersion lacks specificity beyond temperature and sound.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors ("sculpt possibility from ashes") elevate thematic depth. Subtext about suppressed truth resonates, though emotional beats occasionally lean on melodrama rather than earned symbolism. Ending's quiet defiance delivers memorable resonance despite occasional explanatory phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unconventional exorcism mechanics (debt owed to ancestral lies rather simple possession). No purple prose; tension arises organically from generational trauma concept rather than manufactured drama. Key turning sound feels narratively essential rather than arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>The story's emotional throughline connects its disparate elements remarkably well. Each component serves a thematic purpose, though orbital debris setting could be more deeply integrated. Concise structure enhances rather than restricts the narrative's potency.</grade>
