<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is sufficiently developed through actions and symbols, but backstory and emotional nuance are minimal. Motivation is clear but somewhat underexplored beyond surface-level rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has coherent progression and bookends the action effectively, but pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing the rebellion’s stakes and resolution within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory details and symbolic contrasts, though the miniature world’s mechanics could be more explicit to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (e.g., “cracks in façade”) and subtext elevates the narrative. Emotional impact is subtle but resonant, with a cohesive theme of quiet defiance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting the “museum steward” trope and using the cameo as a rebellion symbol. Language avoids clichés, favoring evocative, precise imagery over formulaic prose.</comment>
