<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is archetypal and introspective but lacks depth beyond philosophical musings; motivation is clear yet thinly explored; actions align with wisdom-seeking but fail to reveal complexity or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot is a static, contemplative vignette with minimal narrative progression; lacks traditional structure or tension despite thematic cohesion; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with immersive sensory details; petrified forest directly mirrors the schematic’s logic, enhancing atmosphere and theme through visual and symbolic parallels.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and symbolic resonance elevate the prose; intellectual rather than emotional impact; theme of paradoxical truth is potent but underpersonalized, weakening universal resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avails fresh, cerebral interpretations of “doomsday device” and “wisdom” but leans on minimalist tropes (mystic swordsman, petrified forest) that skirt originality; avoids clichés but lacks visceral emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and conceptually rich but struggles to balance introspection with narrative momentum; style and theme align, but lacks urgency and character dimensionality demanded by elite literary standards.</comment>
