<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characterization is minimal. The hive-therapist's hive-mind "we" perspective lacks individuality or emotional layers, functioning more as an abstract narrative device than a being with interiority. Agents are described rather than revealed through action. Seven's charger plug regret is poignant but feels like a literary conceit rather than a lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work logically (therapist drains regrets through wax) but lack narrative momentum. The vignette structure creates completeness but feels static. Cause-effect between wax ritual and Seven's resolution is mystical rather than earned. Pacing within the constraint is decent, though the final loop to "another night" diminishes dramatic stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with oppressive sterility meeting esoteric ritual - candles in a secret facility create cognitive dissonance. Sensory details (humming regrets, cooling wax weight) effectively immerse. The "psychic migraine" concept and "merry bitterness" contrast are powerful, though the facility's purpose remains frustratingly vague despite tone cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylistic precision elevates the work. Metaphors (regrets as wax, psyche as "ephemeral") resonate deeply. The circular structure mirrors the theme beautifully. Subtext about emotional sanitation in service of progress is potent. Emotional impact isn't visceral but lingers as existential melancholy, with ending's cyclical repetition delivering thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original concepts (hive-therapist, wax coding) freshen familiar ground but some elements risk becoming their own tropes (mystical emotional drainage). Prose borders on self-indulgence with lines like "psychic migraine" but redeems itself through specificity (the scuffed plug's symbolism). Emotional nuance wins out over explicitness, though the collective therapist voice occasionally feels like a shortcut.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves a haunting elegance through concept-alignment: the sterile facility's emotional labor mirrors the wax's physical transformation. The theme of forgotten regrets as fuel works conceptually, though brevity leaves some threads dangling (why this cadre of agents? What's the "discovery?"). Final image of cyclical futility offers lingering contemplation.</comment>
