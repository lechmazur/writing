<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's quiet despotism is shown through repetitive tasks and symbolic actions, but internalization often feels indirect despite precise actions mirroring trauma. Motivation for "belonging to nowhere" remains abstract, though consistent with dissociation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has satisfying symmetry (reconstruction/destruction), but jigsaw puzzles as narrative device feel tenuously linked to mask curation. Pacing balances introspection with action within word constraints, though causality between puzzle-completion phases lacks rhythmic clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends sterile sci-fi and decaying domesticity effectively, but plant communication remains peripheral - figs/ferns function more as metaphor than integrated ecosystem. Sunlight's destructive role creates potent visual contrast between organic life and artificial artifacts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storytelling employs powerful metaphor (masks as collective/individual trauma) and achieves emotional resonance through tactile destruction rather than exposition. Ending's "profound quiet" resonates beyond plot mechanics. Occasional over-explanation ("noble foolishness") slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids military genre tropes by focusing on domestic ritual. Sensory details avoid clich√©s (carbonizing smiles rather than dramatic speeches). Some phrases like "bio-signals hum" verge on conceptual vagueness, but overall achieves distinctive fusion of post-trauma healing rituals with SF elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Element integration works conceptually but unevenly - carbonization is viscerally essential, while jigsaw puzzles and plant communality feel like symbolic scaffolding rather than architectural necessity. Narrative cohesion survives element removal tests, though with diminished thematic resonance.</comment>
