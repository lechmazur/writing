<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character's expertise in pattern recognition as an orchardist is credibly woven into his detective work, but the tragedy feels underdeveloped despite motivating his actions. His voice is distinct but occasionally veers into overwritten monologuing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Presentation to Finch creates clear narrative arc; the peacock-code reveal is a masterstroke of structural cohesion. Pacing feels slightly uneven in early setup but culminates with devastating precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Contrast between sterile hangar and organic drones/feathers creates compelling dissonance. Sensory details of polymer wings/industrial lighting enhance immersion, though lost opportunity to connect orchardist's past environment with current setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphor of decay/apocalypse in agricultural vs. technological contexts adds profound subtext. The peacock's tail as both beauty and weapon offers rich symbolic resonance. Dialogue's theatricality risks melodrama but works for tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI writing tells through specific imagery and organic progression, though the emotional undercurrents could be more subtly rendered. The orchardist's transition from agrarian to avenging academic feels earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Every element synergizes toward the central revelation. The brevity enhances impact, ending precisely at the emotional/ideological crescendo. Invites multiple readings about obsession, pattern-seeking, and vengeance.</comment>
