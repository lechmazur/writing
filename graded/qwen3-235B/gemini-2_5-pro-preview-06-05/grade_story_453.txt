<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation drives character actions, but Elian lacks psychological complexity, remaining a symbolic conduit for the story’s themes rather than a fully dimensional figure. His foolhardiness is present but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with a clear arc (obsession → pursuit → death → legacy), but pacing feels slightly compressed in mid-sections, leaving some emotional beats underdeveloped despite the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (plastic pines, cotton-cloud fibers) create a haunting, self-contained world. The glass dome and miniature scale amplify existential tension, though the setting’s symbolic implications could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (Sky-Disc as lid, shaking as lullaby) elevate the narrative. The ending’s thematic resonance—finding tenderness in chaos—lingers, though emotional stakes could be less abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original, cohesive voice avoids clichés; metaphors (birch bark as confessional tapes) are inventive. No overt purple prose, though some abstractions (e.g., “cosmic tenderness”) risk vagueness without grounding in action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole, with the snow globe’s allegory and Elian’s demise reinforcing the story’s philosophical core. Minor quibbles with pacing and character depth detract minimally from overall impact.</comment>
