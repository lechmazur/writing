<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Intrinsically tied to dolls' voicelessness, but motivations remain abstract, with minimal emotional interiority beyond stated purpose. No dialogue weakens 'voice' requirement; physical form's symbolic resonance compensates partially.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear ascent-to-sacrifice arc, but pacing feels compressed. Disconnection between cosmic setup and rapid Spire climax; thematic throughline maintains coherence despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ethereal grit tone realized through vivid cosmic imagery (pollen, ozone, cracked celestial navigation). Overly dense description occasionally obscures narrative urgency while maintaining atmospheric brilliance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., healing as violent forging) provoke existential reflection. Finale's self-dissolution creates haunting resonance. Subtext about creation/destruction cycles strongly integrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing risks distancing (moonlight-spun, pearlescent gleam), but overall originality shines. Tropes (forbidden creation, sacrifice) subverted through surreal execution rather than pure novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegantly synthesizes elements into mythic structure. Short form forces necessary abstraction which works aesthetically but may sacrifice emotional immersion. Lingering thematic questions about cost/redemption elevate beyond concept.</comment>
