<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (wielding "improbable power") lacks psychological depth, feels abstract rather than emotionally resonant. Actions align with stated traits but lack interiority; narration remains observational rather than embodied. "Underwater welder" detail only superficially tied to pressure metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pacing compresses necessary revelations about "unraveling" timelines but maintains forward momentum through tactile details (e.g., shimmering air, humming music). The dome's transformation from planetarium to nightclub creates visual momentum but sacrifices explanation of cause-effect relationships for resolving the rift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Broken planetarium-as-nightclub creates potent visual and symbolic contrasts (sacred/spiritual vs. profane/decayed). Sensory details excel in marrying concept to mood: pulsing strobes mirroring fractured reality, warped light at the rift's epicenter. Underwater profession and pressure analogies underdeveloped in atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evoke/impact: The merging of personal and cosmic transformation is conceptually arresting but emotionally distant. Effective metaphors ("fulcrum of existence") undercut by declarative emotionalism ("profound quiet") rather than earned resonance. The ending suggests thematic ambition but lacks layered subtext beneath time-rupture premise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality: Conceptual combination of "haunted heirlooms + multiversal rupture" is inventive, but execution relies on familiar tropes (mirrored ghosts, family legacy). Avoids purple prose but sometimes trades complexity for poetic vagueness ("wield improbable power"). The "pampering" method avoids generic time-healing clich√©s through tactile specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesion: Elements function collectively but unevenly. Setting and "moments of unraveling" inseparable from plot, while "patiently impatient" characterization and inherited mystery could be more organically integrated. Strong central metaphor pays dividends thematically despite compressed form.</comment>
