<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct, and motivation rooted in guilt/truma clear, but emotional growth remains too internalized without sufficient outward manifestation of transformation. Nuanced conflict between acceptance and self-punishment exists but lacks visceral dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Circular structure works thematically but sacrifices traditional cohesion; progression of creating sanctuary is logically consistent, though the reset resolution feels underdeveloped. Pacing matches psychological intensity but leaves resolution ambiguously abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel's surrealism matches psychological landscape but lacks tactile specificity. Raindrop and lure offer vivid sensory focus, yet atmospheric elements like 'swirling nebulas' lean too heavily on abstract grandeur without grounding in concrete immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (trauma-as-architecture, time-as-thread) are evocative. Final revelation emerges organically from symbols rather than exposition. Subtext about guilt's cyclical nature and sanctification of failure resonates powerfully, though emotional impact slightly undercut by ornate language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avods clich√©s in trauma/time-loop synthesis; 'nesting' as healing mechanism shows ingenuity. Occasional purple prose ('monument to failure,' 'sacred diorama') and underdeveloped quantum mechanics concepts prevent perfection. Emotional truths conveyed through symbolic actions rather than stated sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematic whole but unevenly: trauma and artifacts integrate seamlessly while quantum mechanics feel arbitrarily chosen. Brevity enhances metaphorical compression but leaves structural foundations exposed. Lingering tension between redemption and resignation provides intellectual resonance.</comment>
