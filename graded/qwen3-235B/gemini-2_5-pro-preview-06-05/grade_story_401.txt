<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's voice is distinct, motivation is clear and deeply emotional, but there's underdevelopment in how their wilderness guide background meaningfully informs their approach to decoding the blanket - the professional expertise feels underutilized beyond surface-level contrast.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains internal logic with tight cause-effect linking the decoding method to emotional resolution, though the expedition's connection to the sunken ship's specific history feels underdeveloped - the story achieves complete emotional arc within constraints but lacks narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Submersible setting and oceanic pressures create palpable physical and psychological compression that mirrors internal emotions; the spectral ballroom and tactile coffee details create a singular immersive atmosphere where each sensory choice consciously enhances theme and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphorical density (ring as accusation, knots as language) works symbiotically with emotional progression; the narrative structure itself mirrors the decoding process, creating metatextual resonance; the revelation subverts expectations while maintaining emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While containing moments of overwritten imagery ("abyssal dark" feels familiar), most metaphors are original and specific; emotional states emerge through tangible details rather than exposition; the wilderness guide element avoids clich√© but occasionally strains credibility in technical details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance despite artificial element-checking that occasionally reveals its scaffolding; all assigned components are present and functional, but some connections (pirate ship ballroom's necessity, wilderness guide relevance) feel strategically optimized rather than organically inevitable.</comment>
