<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but not deeply explored; Kael’s internal complexity remains surface-level despite strong symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but leans on condensed exposition rather than organic progression; pacing feels slightly compressed for emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through sensory contrasts (sterile station vs. roaring forge), but some worldbuilding remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor (flag/cage) add depth; ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in tone/concept, but some phrasing (e.g., "professionally wild") borders on overly stylized abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Cohesion is achieved but uneven; certain elements (e.g., paddleboarding) feel extrinsic to the story’s core themes.</comment>
