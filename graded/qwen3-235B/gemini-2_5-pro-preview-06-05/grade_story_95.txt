<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (resurrecting lost languages) is clear but lacks psychological depth; actions align with traits, but inner conflict or growth beyond the surface is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression via pairing myth with data is logical, but the resolution feels abrupt; emotional arc lacks the weight its thematic premise demands.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting (linguistic storm tracking HQ) and tactile details (buttons, crackling speakers) create a hauntingly specific atmosphere that enhances the tone;</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (dance, storms, buttons as tombstones) elevate the narrative; theme of cultural memory resonates through poetic precision rather than overt statements;</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors offset occasional ornate phrasing; "forgotten dance" feels original but "atmospheric anomaly" skates close to clinical abstraction;</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion (buttons as linguistic artifacts, storm HQ as metaphor for cultural entropy) though some strain under scrutiny;</comment>
