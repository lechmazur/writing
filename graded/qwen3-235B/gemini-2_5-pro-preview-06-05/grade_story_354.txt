<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weakness in character interiority; actions driven by preordained symbolism rather than organic psychology. Motivation remains abstract despite surface coherence. Physically ethereal form poorly explored for emotional contrast with teddy bear's weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Excellent mechanical pacing and cause-effect logic within constraints. Slight contrivance in ricochet solution feeling too pat for stakes. Resolutions compressed but functional. Premise-to-climax trajectory remains linear despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich atmosphere through specific data-light metaphors (crystalline corridors, null-space sandbox). Some metaphors (e.g., "background hum") lack visceral weight. Sensory palette skewed heavily toward sight/sound at cost of deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (teddy prison, aurora liberation) and duality between chaos/structure. Ending's quiet transcendence lingers. Subtext about digital souls feels urgent without sermonizing. Pacing sustains tension via precise, kinetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre templates through data-as-magic system and unexpected prison object. Purple prose minimized except in cosmic disclaimers. Emotional impact emerges through abstraction rather than character intimacy, maintaining AI-adjacent ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock with mechanical precision but lack lived-in texture. Brevity serves the story's elegiac tone rather than feeling forced. Thematic throughline about compassion outweighs minor tonal dissonances in worldbuilding.</comment>
