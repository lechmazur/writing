<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; "freelancer of everything" feels more like a label than a lived identity influencing actions beyond plot necessities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from setup to resolution, with the grandfather’s memory as a thematically satisfying payoff; rhythm-as-plot-mechanism stretches plausibility slightly but serves thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting creates vivid, immersive atmosphere but underutilizes steampunk specifics; tone harmonizes with sensory details but doesn’t deepen beyond surface-level mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic prose elevates emotional impact; metaphor (waves/erosion) and subtext (legacy in small acts) add layers; ending resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elevates familiar tropes (data-ghosts, steampunk) with specificity (tying shoes), but lacks audacious originality; prose avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on formal diction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade>Combines elements cohesively but occasionally feels checklist-driven; steampunk setting and rhythm method lack deeper symbiosis; leaves intellectual impression but not visceral resonance.
