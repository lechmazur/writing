<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional granularity; motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded. The transformation lacks earned emotional resonance despite poetic descriptions of actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but the climactic gaze feels abrupt. Folding sequence lacks intermediate stakes, though the origami-as-map conceit is cohesive. Resolution satisfies thematic goals but feels narratively static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (salt-bleached stone, brittle hush) crystallize the liminal setting. The island's sentience emerges organically from environmental descriptions rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Meditative tone and origami-as-metaphor create powerful subtext about cognition. The final "profound peace" risks sentimentality but earns thematic weight through precise imagery and cyclical structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing ("vibrant, realistically imaginary torrents") borders on self-indulgence, but original metaphors (consciousness as harvestable substance) and tactile verb choices (grinding husk, stiffening neck) mostly transcend formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Economical use of assigned elements achieves thematic unity, though the brevity limits philosophical extrapolation. The origami's transformation delivers conceptual closure while maintaining poetic ambiguity.</comment>
