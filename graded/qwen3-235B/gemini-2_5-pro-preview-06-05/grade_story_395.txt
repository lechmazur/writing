<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characterâ€™s duality is present but lacks depth in inner conflict development; motivations are clear but not fully explored, with some emotional beats told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but strained by word count; beginning and end connection hinges on underdeveloped backstory, causing minor pacing stumbles in the middle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but superficial; sensory details (sky-orchids, celestial horticulture) evoke atmosphere but fail to deepen character motivations or thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "forgotten dance") elevate the narrative; emotional impact is undercut by occasional direct declarations over subtlety, but the central conflict is compellingly framed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi and heist genre; some phrasing ("shattered star" laughter) leans on familiar imagery, but the concept of "art-as-resistance" adds freshness. Underdeveloped subtext hints at deeper potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements feel partially imposed rather than organic; the heist mechanism works, but the emotional payoff is diluted by underexplored relationships and thematic shortcuts.</comment>
