<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motives exist but lack depth; Kael’s philosophical practicality is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced decisions. Vorlag remains one-dimensionally greedy. The tree-planting tradition feels tacked on rather than organically integrated with Kael’s personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on sudden tonal shifts (e.g., Vorlag’s abrupt surrender). The tapestry’s hidden text drives resolution, but the gamble-to-flame transition feels slightly contrived within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (grease, flickering charts) create atmosphere, but the “sacred disorder” tone inconsistently wavers. The setting’s zero-g chaos enhances tension but underutilizes deeper world-building potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of survival vs. greed emerges through the tapestry’s reveal, but emotional resonance is diluted by occasional exposition (e.g., “philosophically practical”). The ending’s hope feels rushed despite symbolic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines sci-fi and medieval elements inventively, but telekinesis and tree traditions lean on trope-like abstractions. Some vivid phrases (“engine grease”) undercut abstract metaphors, creating tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, though the tapestry’s centrality overshadows others (e.g., family tradition). The story’s concept—using historical knowledge in space—is thought-provoking but undercut by surface-level execution.</comment>
