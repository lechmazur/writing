<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (desire to map forests vs. sell scale) are clear but lack nuanced exploration of Elara's internal conflict; her final decision feels underdeveloped despite effective sensory grounding in the marketplace.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a compact arc with strong cause-effect between immortality offer and decision, though the 400-word resolution feels slightly rushed despite clever use of flashbacks to map-scratching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details like fried sky-eels and ozone create immersive tension; floating marketplace's fragility complements immortality theme. The stained marble floor as memory repository elevates atmospheric integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (gilded cage, map-scratching as preservation) deepen subtext; ending resonates through tactile details rather than stated emotions. Conflict resolution lacks full thematic payoff regarding "safeguarding" duty's broader implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-tropes with unique details (coded floor scuffs, sky-eel scent) but occasionally indulges predictable phrases ("hollow eyes of immortals"). Subtle emotional nuance (foot-shuffling, smile) counters some tell-don't-show tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements like the wild marketplace feel organically integrated rather than checklist-driven; the pivotal coded-scratching method feels less like exposition and more like lived-in choice, creating cohesive thematic resonance.</comment>
