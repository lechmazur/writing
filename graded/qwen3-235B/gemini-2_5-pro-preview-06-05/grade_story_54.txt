<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's even-temper and rebelliousness are stated, but not deeply demonstrated through nuanced actions; the unsent letter lacks emotional weight that could connect his traits to visceral motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progresses through transactional beat, but lacks emotional or narrative arc; connections between opening imagery (carnival decay) and closing themes (preservation) remain underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through phantasmagoric decay, but setting's "elegant chaos" isn't fully earned; psychic vibration sensitivity feels underexplored within the carnival context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("placid lake," "ghost preserving ghosts") elevate the prose, but climax lacks emotional resonance; theme of preservation through defiance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blends genre tropes (smugglers, psychic senses) with unique elements (star-pattern timing), but some descriptors ("frantic sprites," "manufactured joy") risk overwriting; emotional subtext feels algorithmically inferred rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual scaffolding (carnival-as-archival-space) intrigues but execution prioritizes style over thematic cohesion; lingering impression stems more from atmosphere than narrative weight.</comment>
