<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is layered but inconsistently integrated; reincarnation and guilt are stated rather than organically rendered. Motivation (disrupt tradition) is clear but undercut by underexplored traits like "tentatively fierce."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but relies on contrivance (storm as narrative catalyst). The arc is complete but constrained by brevity; cause-effect logic is occasionally overshadowed by convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details like "ghosts of bad cooking" immerse readers, but the fantastical setting (recipe library, talking about Wasting Sickness) creates tonal dissonance that weakens emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("guiltâ€™s haunting echo") and subtext about tradition vs. innovation stand out. Ending resonates emotionally but is undermined by uneven "telling" vs. "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original concepts (reincarnated goldfish therapist) lean into whimsy instead of depth. Overwrought phrases ("bruised purple") and predictable symbols (storm for tension) suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements are superficially tied to plot but lack symbiotic integration. The core theme (defying tradition) is compelling but diluted by tonal inconsistency and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>
