<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly without deep psychological grounding; vendetta-to-forgiveness arc is conceptually strong but executes too hastily, relying on plot mechanics over emotional realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is logically structured but feels compressed; key revelations lack narrative weight due to pacing constraints, though the symbolic resolution ties back effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (e.g., "stench of rot and rebellion") and environmental decay create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's inner turmoil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Compelling emotional trajectory and layered themes survive brevity, but the ambitious scope stretches structural capacity, making some elements feel schematic.</comment>
