<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; zealotry and desperation are present but lack psychological nuance. Reaction to revelation feels abrupt, undercutting emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a distinct arc but feels compressed; action drives progression, yet the lightning twist relies on technical detail over organic momentum. Pacing falters slightly in the climactic moment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (storm, sacred site), but connections between setting and character psychology could deepen. Sensory details immerse but don't fully contextualize the Order's worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery and a thematic twist elevate the story. The ending evokes existential reflection, but emotional resonance is undercut by the detachment of Kaelen's abrupt epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tropes—euphoric agitation and atmospheric distortion show ingenuity—but some phrases ("augmented frame," "superheated air") lean toward genre clichés. Nuanced emotion is implied but not deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story hinges on a compelling concept but uneven execution. Elements cohere thematically, though brevity weakens character depth and temporal shifts. Memorable premise, but secondary aspects (bridle, timeframe) feel underexplored.</comment>
