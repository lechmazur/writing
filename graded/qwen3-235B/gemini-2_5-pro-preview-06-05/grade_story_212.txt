<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s trauma and resolve are clear, but her voice remains diffused—her actions are evocative but lack visceral, idiosyncratic specificity that would make her defiance feel earned rather than allegorical.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The discovery of the cards propels the plot efficiently, and the progression to exorcism feels logical. Pacing is taut but the ending’s abrupt emotional resolution may undercut lasting tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ethereal plains and mist-sea are rendered with vivid, haunting sensory detail (pearlescent soil, resonant song) that directly deepen atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story’s metaphor-laden prose (e.g., “chaining heart,” “song of boundaries”) and symbolic catharsis are affecting, though some imagery borders on overwrought. The theme of reclaiming autonomy is consistent but could use more subtextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending magical realism with post-apocalyptic mundanity, but “raw solace” and “pearlescent soil” risk florid abstraction. Emotional truth is shown through scrawled cards, but subtext is occasionally diluted by overt explanation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive, with each element contributing to a singular vision of trauma and reclamation. The brevity feels intentional, though some connections (e.g., the resource war’s lingering impact) are underexplored.</comment>
