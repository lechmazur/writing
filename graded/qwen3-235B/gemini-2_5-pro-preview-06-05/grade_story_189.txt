<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's 'bright-eyed' quality is more inferred than shown; her motivations drive the plot but lack emotional depth or vulnerability to make her truly resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing is taut but the compressed word limit strains the resolution's emotional payoff; the twist about terraforming feels slightly rushed despite logical cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunting sensory details (spectral moans, ozone scent) and post-apocalyptic lighthouse setting create vivid atmosphere that complements character and theme, though some elements feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery ('whispers of the past faded...promise of rain') and thematic layering of preservation vs. renewal elevate impact; ending's thematic clarity outweighs minor pacing issues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in subverting 'escape to stars' trope with terraforming twist, though some descriptors (e.g., 'hulking apparatus') lean toward genre-generic phrasing rather than distinctively vivid language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High cohesion despite constraints; the lighthouse as terraforming engine demonstrates clever integration of elements that feel conceptually tied rather than arbitrarily assigned.</comment>
