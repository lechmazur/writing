<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but could be more deeply demonstrated through layered actions rather than exposition. Internal conflict is articulated but under-explored through nuanced behavior or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Progression from personal resignation to symbolic action forms a coherent arc. Effective compression into 440 words, though the Fair encounter feels slightly perfunctory in driving stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thick air, axe sounds, herb scents, and wind create immersive atmosphere. Setting details (burned world, dying orchard) powerfully mirror emotional terrain and thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Similes ("ash," "frantic event like speed dating") are effective but sparse. Emotional resonance partly undercut by occasional abstractions ("faith he didn't possess"), yet the central symbolic act lingers memorably.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</comment>Repetition of "charred serenity" and "despair" risks calcifying into trope. Some atmospheric phrases lean poetic without deepening nuance. The medieval/fantasy dissonance remains underexplored conceptually.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</comment>Tight thematic integration of elements (burned past vs. fragile hope) justifies brevity. Leaves quiet resonance without feeling formulaic, though not all assigned components feel organically essential.</comment>
