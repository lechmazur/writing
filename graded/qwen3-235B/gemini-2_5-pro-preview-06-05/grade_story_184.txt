<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivation feels underexplored; the seashells are symbolic but their connection to Finn's deeper drives remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing falters slightly in mid-sections, but the beginning/end loop cohesively around the act of randomized resetting, with logical cause/effect for a surreal premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, unsettling sensory details (ozone, silence, shimmering time) create a haunting vacuum chamber atmosphere; contrast between sterile tech and fossilized organic remains enhances the tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cosmic wedgie" and "punchline" deliver layered absurdism; the ending's open ambiguity and subtext about cosmic futility resonate beyond its weirdness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing; "predictably unpredictable" and "horribly beautiful" are sharp; some phrasing (e.g., "flippant solemnity") borders on contrived but stays purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate inventively but unevenly; the vacuum garden and backward time feel conceptually isolated from the reset mechanism, diluting total cohesion.</comment>
