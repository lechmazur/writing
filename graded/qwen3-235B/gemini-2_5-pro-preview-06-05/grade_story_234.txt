<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (craving cosmic understanding) is clear and consistent, but "gentle swordsman" aspect remains underexplored beyond a hilt mention. The "faithfully unfaithful" attribute is handled through thematic narration but lacks interpersonal tension. Voice maintains distinct dryness but feels occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a contained, logical arc with the moon's light as organic pacing mechanism. Sundial mechanism's execution drives action coherently. Beginning/end connection is strong through the motif of waiting/patience. Pacing feels slightly rushed in mystical revelation's aftermath.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on strong but sparse details (velvet quiet, moonlight angles). Dinosaur museum setting creates conceptual contrast with cosmic themes but misses opportunities to integrate fossilization with time themes. Sensory engagement is limited to visual elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical resonance (matchbox as container of infinity, sundial as lens). Ending crystallizes themes of patient pursuit. Shows rather than states emotions through physical objects and actions. Subtext about preserving knowledge through unconventional means feels profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>No formulaic structures detected. Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyrical precision. Cosmic descriptions avoid sci-fi clich√©s. Emotional logic feels earned through ritualistic repetition rather than exposition. Some generic phrases ("utterly alien") slightly diminish originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but not transcendently. Word limit creates intensity but restricts emotional expansion. Style prioritizes atmosphere over explication, which works thematically. Lingering questions about Kael's past study ("recently grasping") suggest depth without need for unpacking.</comment>
