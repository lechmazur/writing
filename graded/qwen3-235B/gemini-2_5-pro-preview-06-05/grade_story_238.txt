<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is well-established through concise, textured descriptions and dialogue, but lacks deeper progression or revelation beyond established melancholy; motivation is clear but minimally explored beyond surface-level longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lacks a traditional plot but achieves a coherent emotional arc through subtle shifts in tone; beginning and ending align thematically, though the lack of narrative progression may test boundaries of structural completeness in short form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with layered sensory details (e.g., static, dust motes, tactile wallet) that deepen mood; setting/timeframe synergy amplifies existential tension between light/dark.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor ("light stolen by midnight," "dust mote as captured star") and subtext; dialogue/narration balance creates haunting resonance; ending lingers thematically despite compact scale.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in conceiving a "collector of sorrows" through transient realities; avoids tropes via poetic, personalized grief; some phrases (e.g., "steel wool charm") risk borderline cliché but mostly subvert expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive, melancholic whole; style prioritizes poetic precision over excess, but story’s brevity feels thematic rather than restrictive; lingering emotional impact is potent if narrow in scope.</comment>
