<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and tied to ancestral legacy, but emotional depth and distinct voices lack full realization; "sincere rebel" aligns with themes but feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight discovery-focused structure with clear beginning/middle connection, but pacing feels slightly rushed, with resolution of the drainage system's significance introduced abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly crafted through sensory details—shivering lanterns, moisture, "building's breath"—that immerse readers in the passage's oppressive, haunted weight, enhancing both tension and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors like "braided bitterness," the keystone's "weeping" as literal symbolism) elevate the narrative; ending ties back to storm motif, but emotional impact lacks full gut-punch potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids generic tropes by framing preservation as rebellion, with the sticky note’s origin subverting expectations; while prose remains disciplined, some phrases ("centuries of stone") border on cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like the sticky note and ancestral ties integrate cohesively, but brevity limits deeper exploration of character nuance and thematic complexity; the ending hints at broader stakes without full payoff.</comment>
