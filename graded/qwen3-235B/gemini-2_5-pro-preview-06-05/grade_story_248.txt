<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character possesses thematic depth through paradoxical traits (coy fury, unsteady guardianship), but psychological complexity remains surface-level. Motivation is conceptually coherent but lacks humanizing details to make it emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves structural completeness within constraints, with clear beginning-middle-end progression, but revelations unfold predictably. The 'reassembling' method feels under-depicted as both physical process and metaphorical journey.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through sensory-specific descriptions of environmental decay and cosmic grandeur. The interplay between intimate human artifacts (shreds) and celestial scale creates rich atmosphere, though machine-bird mechanics remain under-explicated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (shattered text as shattered belief) and thematic duality (prophecy as invitation/catastrophe) operate powerfully. The endingâ€™s quiet defiance delivers emotional weight, though some descriptive passages verge on ornamental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in prophecy subversion and automaton symbolism, but familiar archetypes (solitary guardian, sacred texts) and occasional syntactic uniformity ("light"-related descriptions) suggest faint algorithmic residue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Strong thematic unity anchored by prophecy reinterpretation, but micro-tension between intimate human scale and cosmic stakes occasionally strains coherence. Brief length serves the character-driven revelation well.</comment>
