<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "spirit too large for the forests" show thematic alignment but lack emotional depth; motivation to learn healing is clear but undersheds the complexity of his transformation; interactions with key objects (letter, bike) hint at internal conflict but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure uses bike rides as both physical and psychological progression but struggles with condensing time jumps; cause-effect between letter discovery and revelation feels slightly abridged; pacing balances quiet transformation with apocalyptic subtext but resolution depends on exposition over earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ossuary/restaurant setting is visually striking but inconsistently tactile—antiseptic herbs and bone-lined walls evoke atmosphere but lack connective tissue to plot mechanics; bone-healing motifs could deepen but remain symbolic rather than functional to the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("flesh re-knitting," "screaming metal") create lasting resonance; instruction scenes avoid sentimentality with clinical lyricism; subtext about reconstruction as both literal and moral imperative elevates genre, though ending relies slightly on portentous dialogue over earned gravitas.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes (time-travel as "future war" is underplayed), but some phrases ("grace under fire," "harsh tenderness") flirt with cliché; sensory details (ozone, calluses) are specific but occasionally over-prioritized over emotional texture; transitions into nightmares feel intentionally jarring but risk disorientation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist without fully intersecting—ossuary as healing space underutilized, bike rides' physicality could mirror psychological fracture; style wavers between poetic and expositionary; brief length works for mystery but sacrifices fully realized emotional stakes.</comment>
