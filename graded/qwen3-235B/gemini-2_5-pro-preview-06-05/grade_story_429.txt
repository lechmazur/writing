<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (restoring voices) but lacks psychological depth or internal conflict; his farmer identity informs sensory details (soil, west field find) but doesn't sufficiently shape his decision-making or emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tightly structured arc with cause-effect clarity (ritual components → activation → success) but lacks narrative tension; resolution feels emotionally inevitable rather than earned through character action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory immersion through aurora descriptions and tactile details (ozonic paste, glowing spools) but setting functions more as aesthetic backdrop than active force shaping events.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic metaphor clusters ("prison of magnetic decay," "perfect unbroken line") elevate this beyond plot mechanics; ritualistic pacing creates emotional weight, though subtext about memory preservation remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subverts magic realism tropes through technoscientific mysticism (audio spools as enchanted objects); avoids clichés but occasionally edges into ornate abstraction ("shard of fallen starlight") obscuring emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional whole but lack deeper thematic interconnectivity; the brevity works for the ritual's immediacy but limits exploration of the protagonist's psychological landscape.</comment>
