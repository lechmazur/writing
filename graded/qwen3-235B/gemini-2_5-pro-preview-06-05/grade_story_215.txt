<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (synthesizing science and spirituality) are clear but under-explored; Elias's "rattled faith" manifests primarily through plot actions rather than internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression through puzzles is logically structured but feels procedural; the hidden room's payoff lacks sufficient emotional or thematic resonance to justify the cryptic journey's tight pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of stark contrasts (sterile lab vs. tango rhythms, spiritual vs. mechanical) and specific sensory details (grime on the postcard, rattling machinery); atmosphere occasionally lapses into generic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical tension between science/spirituality and order/chaos; the ending's thematic clarity ("architect of understanding") elevates the narrative, though some emotional beats rely on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s by blending exorcism with psychological science; stumbles in character psychology (Elias's internal conflict is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clever integration of assigned elements into a cohesive whole; the brevity works symbiotically with the puzzle-box narrative structure, though some thematic threads feel truncated.</comment>
