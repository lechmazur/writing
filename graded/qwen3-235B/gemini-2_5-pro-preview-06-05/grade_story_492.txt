<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's distracted inventor trait is superficially hinted at but not deeply integrated into actions or decisions; motivation feels stated rather than organically demonstrated through concrete actions tied to his inventive nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear structure but lacks narrative tension or character transformation within word limit; infiltration method is conceptually clever but underdeveloped, weakening the sense of procedural logic and stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details that immerse readers in the cyberpunk setting; however, world-building occasionally prioritizes texture over meaningful integration with character motivations or thematic concerns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Functional cohesion exists but feels constrained by checklist elements rather than organic development; brevity sacrifices emotional investment despite the intriguing conceptual framework and distinctive voice.</comment>
