<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is consistent but insufficiently explored beyond surface skepticism; motivation is clear but could delve deeper into psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through inciting incident and metamorphosis, though the 500-word arc feels slightly rushed in resolving emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (chemical rot, oily iridescence) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that directly mirrors the town's decay and the beetle's transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., "fishbone" phrasing) and symbolic resonance in the beetle's change, but the ending's hopeful tone lacks layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong originality in the beetle's organic-mechanical metamorphosis, but clich√©d elements (reclusive monks, polluted swamp) weaken overall novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of core elements with thematic weight (neglect/transformation), though brevity occasionally favors efficiency over emotional depth.</comment>
