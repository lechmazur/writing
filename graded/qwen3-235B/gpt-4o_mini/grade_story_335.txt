<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's "shaky" trait is superficially portrayed through physical descriptions but lacks nuanced psychological depth; motivations (searching for truth to make peace) are vague, with insufficient backstory connecting to the amber or cathedral setting; dialogue sounds contrived with overwritten philosophical undertones.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative structure follows a minimalist arc but relies on vague transitions (e.g., sudden arrival at "hidden alcove"); cause-effect between the map and climax lacks logical causality; pacing uneven, with excessive focus on atmospheric description over plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Decaying cathedral setting creates vivid visual contrast, but its symbolic connection to Jax's inner world is underexplored; atmosphere leans heavily on clich√©d juxtapositions (color vs ruin) without unique sensory texture; timeframe element ("echoing hour") remains decorative rather than integral to mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (spider/web/mirror) operate at surface level without layered subtext; ending attempts thematic resolution but feels unearned; lacks emotional specificity in Jax's transformation, relying on abstract "self-discovery" tropes rather than concrete character revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic structures but contains predictable beats (wounded hero, cryptic artist, mystical artifact); some originality in merging urban decay with artistic resistance theme, though amber spider metaphor remains derivative of common existential symbols; language occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function mechanically without seamless integration; tight word limit exposes forced connections between plot devices (map, mirror) and character's internal journey; lacks editorial precision in trimming superfluous description to heighten dramatic impact; theme of self-confrontation feels diluted.</comment>
