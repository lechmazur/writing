<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (to outrun prophecy) is clear and consistent with her actions, but deeper exploration of her "unsettled" nature is superficial. Inner conflict drives the plot but lacks nuanced emotional layers or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear arc (lost to transformation) but feels rushed. The puzzle box drives the plot effectively, yet cause-effect between aligning pieces and seashell’s power lacks depth. Pacing balances action but falters in middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting’s sensory details (glistening seashell, roaring ocean) create mood, but connection between "architectural secrets" and the seashell’s design is underdeveloped. Atmosphere enhances introspection but not thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (puzzle box = fractured wishes) and symbolic transformation are effective. Ending feels purposeful but slightly pat, undercutting potential ambiguity. Central theme of self-reclamation is clear if familiar.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés (e.g., seashell-chamber twist) but relies on "dark wish gone wrong" tropes. Language is lyrical without descending into purple prose; emotional resonance is suggested through imagery more than visceral character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are integrated but strain under the weight of their sheer number. The puzzle box and prophecy anchor the narrative, but "architectural secrets" and "sharp gentleness" feel loosely tethered. Lingering impact is modest.</comment>
