<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s immortality shapes her connection to the garden but lacks depth in emotional nuance; her motivation is clear but underexplored in terms of internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc of decay to hope, but pacing is uneven; the central action of launching the earbud feels symbolic but lacks narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing; the earbud cover is inventive, yet “ancient trees” and “withered branches” risk generic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but the story leans on assigned components unevenly; brevity amplifies thematic ambition but limits narrative complexity.</comment>
