<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clara's motivation is clear but her inwardly social trait feels underexplored and disconnected from her actions. The "rattled exorcist" aspect is stated but not deeply embodied; her guarded disclosures drive the plot but lack organic emotional weight. The postcard's significance to her personal history is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dance lesson framework drives the plot initially but becomes a perfunctory device for transitioning to the hidden room. Logical gaps exist: solving a single riddle unlocks a complex staircase, and the sudden resolution in the mirror room feels rushed. The beginning-middle-end flow is functional but lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The psychic facility's dim, labyrinthine atmosphere creates mood, but the dance floor setting feels awkwardly juxtaposed with supernatural elements. Sensory details (cold air, haunting music) work well but are inconsistently applied. The "dance of shadows" concept ties atmosphere to theme, but the facility itself feels generic rather than specific to psychic research.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of dancing with spirits offers thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on stated feelings ("her heart raced with coy aggression"). The ending's "embrace the wonder" message feels clich√©d despite promising imagery of light/shadow mirrors. Tension is minimal, with obstacles resolved too easily.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Contains fresh intersections (exorcist/dancer, science/spirits) but leans on tropes: hidden rooms, cryptic postcards, and "haunting" music. The coy aggression concept is original but underdeveloped. Language sometimes veers into purple prose ("pulse through her urging her to synthesize fears with discovery") without distinctive voice. Character internal logic lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story incorporates all elements but with inconsistent integration. The psychic facility and puzzles feel modular rather than essential; dance lessons serve plot mechanics over emotional/psychological realism. The central theme exists but lacks complexity. Stylistic choices occasionally hinder clarity.</comment>
