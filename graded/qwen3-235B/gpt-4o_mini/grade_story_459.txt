<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Leo's elegantly clumsy nature is superficially linked to his spectral encounters but lacks deeper psychological motivation. His actions align with seeking closure but feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows a circular structure (silence → exploration → acceptance of silence) but lacks concrete cause/effect. The flower crown catalyzes introspection but isn't integrated into a traditional plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pervasive sensory details (saltwood scent, sand sculptures as impermanence metaphors) create a hauntingly specific world. The lab's temporal liminality mirrors thematic concerns of preserved transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The interplay between silence and ghostly presence creates philosophical resonance. Strong imagery ("canvas for the unexpressed") elevates the narrative, though emotional payoff remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise subverts ghost-hunting tropes, but metaphors like "echoes of sorrow" verge on cliché. Dialogue absent but internal monologue avoids melodrama. Slight overuse of poetic abstraction risks detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified meditation on impermanence and memory. The brevity works as an intimate character study rather than limitation. Lingering questions about Leo's future suggest thematic depth.</comment>
