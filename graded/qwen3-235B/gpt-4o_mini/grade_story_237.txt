<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "proudly humble" are stated but underdeveloped; motivations (heartbreak, ancestral connections) feel abstract rather than organically revealed through actions. Psychic genealogist profession lacks deep integration with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (discovery → vision → epiphany) but pacing feels rushed. Entries in diaries drive action unevenly; cause-effect between vision and resolution is implied but under-explained. Word limit strains cohesion of cosmic-scale themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Space pirate setting is superficially evocative but jarred by incongruous bullet trains. Sensory details (chipped dice texture, morning star's fade) work, but the "grave playfulness" tone oscillates. Atmosphere struggles to unify sci-fi and genealogical mystery elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (dice, constellations) suggest theme but lack emotional weight. Ending's thematic statement feels declarative, not earned. Subtext about intergenerational trauma is hinted but underexplored. Writing style leans on lyrical abstraction at the expense of narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on generic "fated psychic" tropes. Overused terms like "tapestry of destiny" and "echoes of the past" lack originality. Emotions are often stated (e.g., "realization filled her with purpose"), not embodied. Combines bullet trains and space brig without addressing their tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements like dice and diaries are serviceable but strained by forced connections (bullet trains in space context). Style leans toward poetics but lacks precision. Brevity serves mystique but undermines development of complex themes; ending feels more decorative than transformative.</comment>
