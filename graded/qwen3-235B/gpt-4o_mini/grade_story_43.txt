<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation alignment with 'loudly introverted' trait; reactions to the CD feel abstract rather than action-driven. Interior voice lacks distinctness despite first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot moves from searching to self-realization, but transitions lack causal logic. Meandering structure feels intentional yet risks being static; closure feels underdeveloped rather than minimalist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually vivid with neon/damp contrasts and sensory immersion, but 'last human story' timeframe remains unexplored. Fireflies and cathedral create cohesive mood without deepening existential stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (courage as extinguished spark) and haunting imagery elevate impact, but emotional arc leans on familiar 'redemption through memory' tropes. Ending lacks ambiguity to avoid sentimentalism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into 'dying star'/'weight of past' phrasing. Atmosphere shows originality, yet 'loudly introverted' and 'crooked hope' feel conceptually forced rather than organically integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function together but don't produce transcendence beyond their checklist. Brevity supports mood but limits thematic resonance; ending lingers conceptually without earned emotional gravity.</comment>
