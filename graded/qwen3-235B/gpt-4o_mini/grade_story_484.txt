<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to embody values lacks concrete grounding; "uniquely generic" trait remains underexplored. Internal conflict shown through metaphor rather than behavioral nuance. Minimal dialogue fails to establish distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Vague symbolic action (mirror confrontation) insufficiently drives plot. Pacing compresses transformation illogically. Beginning/end connection exists but feels arbitrary rather than inevitable. Conceptual darkness lacks narrative agency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative fragments (damp earth, shadow personification) but fails to integrate protest setting meaningfully. Sensory details superficial; haunted graveyard remains generic rather than shaping character's choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical mirror/darkness constructs present but thinly developed. Central conflict remains abstract; theme of embracing opposition lacks emotional specificity. Writing style occasionally poetic but insufficiently "shows" internal change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on gothic clich√©s (haunted graveyards, symbolic mirrors) without subversion. Character transformation follows predictable arc. Occasional generic descriptors ("lull that felt almost sacred") undermine atmospheric specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</question><comment>Elements included mechanically rather than organically. Short length accentuates structural fragmentation. Writing displays competence but lacks the linguistic distinction or conceptual daring required for prestigious publication.</comment>
