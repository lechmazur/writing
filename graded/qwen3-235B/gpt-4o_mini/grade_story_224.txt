<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elowen's desire to escape mundanity is coherent but underdeveloped; her "openly private" attribute isn't clearly manifested, and internal conflict lacks complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot arc ends abruptly; meteorite texture method feels abstract and under-explained. Rushed pacing undermines emotional weight of her transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere lacks visceral sensory immersion; "giant's dining room" is visually rich but disconnected from rush hour timeframe. Tone shifts inconsistently between chaos and silence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor of meteorite surface connects to buried dreams but relies on telling rather than showing emotional shifts. Ending resolves surface conflict but lacks thematic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Wizard-of-Oz-like metaphors ("texture of a meteorite") feel artificial. Relies on fantasy clichés (magic ladles, giants); emotional beats stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements arbitrarily connected – meteorite texture and rush hour feel forced. Style prioritizes ornamentation over precision. Brief length exposes narrative thinness rather than amplifying focus.</comment>
