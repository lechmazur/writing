<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Clara’s role as dog walker for ultra-rich lacks concrete influence on her actions or personality; fear motivation is stated but underexplored; botanical collection’s symbolic connection is vague, not revealing tangible character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure exists (haunted mansion → blood drive memory → realization), but cause-effect linking is tenuous; blood drive encounter feels forced rather than driving the narrative; pacing uneven but ends with thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay and botanical vividity contrasts well but lacks integration with plot; sensory details like “scent of dust” set tone but don’t deepen themes; haunted mansion remains superficially eerie rather than psychologically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses plant symbolism and subtext about fear, but emotional impact is diluted by vague “liberation” ending; quiet introspection dominates, but tension between Clara’s dual settings (mansion/blood drive) lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Over-reliance on gothic clichés (haunted mansion, crimson orchid as symbol); “carefully careless” phrasing feels contrived; subtext about silence/fear is promising but buried under generic descriptors (“loud silence” without visceral embodiment).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements like blood drive and mansion coexist without seamless synthesis; brevity doesn’t serve thematic weight, undermining cohesion; atmospheric details overwhelm rather than enhance narrative clarity.</comment>
