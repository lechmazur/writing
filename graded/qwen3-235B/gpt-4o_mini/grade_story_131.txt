<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attempts originality through psychic anomaly but relies on clich√©d 'stone' symbolism; emotional transformation feels somewhat machine-generated in its neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly synthesized; atmospheric cohesion undermined by gravitational anomaly's artificiality; theme of transformation competently realized.</comment>
