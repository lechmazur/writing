<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; Felix's alchemical background lacks depth, though his actions align with stated motivations and the cracked lens meaningfully reflects his philosophy of finding beauty in imperfection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with clear arcs, but the "between innings" timeframe creates dissonance. The projector demonstration drives the narrative effectively, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (projector's whirr, glowing constellations) create an immersive, nostalgic mood. The shooting star tracking station setting enhances cosmic wonder, though the timeframe reference slightly undermines atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of the cracked lens symbolizing imperfect yet meaningful perception resonates. The theme of wonder vs. cynicism is clear but lacks subtextual complexity. The ending delivers emotional resonance but could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality weakened by familiar tropes (quixotic dreamer, cynical crowd) and occasional melodrama ("hauntingly cheerful"). The projector method feels nostalgic rather than innovative, and emotional beats lean on explicit statements over nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted; the timeframe and setting require unpacking. The brief length is handled competently, with a clear arc and lingering thematic question about imperfection and hope, though not groundbreaking.</comment>
