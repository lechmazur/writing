<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Limited psychological depth; motivations are stated but not thoroughly explored. The juxtaposition of 'docile bruiser' and 'disturbingly calm' creates surface tension, but fails to translate into meaningful character choices or emotional complexity beyond physical maneuvers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression with clear arc, but underdeveloped middle section. The map’s inclusion as a plot driver feels perfunctory, and the resolution relies on symbolic payoff rather than narrative consequences. Pacing skews toward rapid escalation over sustained tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in the greenhouse’s paradoxical beauty/horror. The plants’ predatory presence and Leo’s empathic connection to them enhance the atmosphere. Drum solos create a dissonant yet effective temporal anchor that merges with the climax.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (mud/rebirth, conducting death/life) elevate thematic resonance. Some emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction over visceral specificity. The ending succeeds as a mythic apotheosis but lacks lingering ambiguity or interpretive layers beneath its lyrical surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through surreal fusion of elements (greenhouse horror, resurrection-as-storytelling) but retains formulaic quest structure. Language occasionally veers into baroque excess (“grotesque beauty,” “pulse of the earth”), diluting otherwise evocative imagery with familiar rhythms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around myth-making but unevenly integrated—drum solos and map feel contextual rather than essential. The brevity enhances atmospheric focus despite sacrificing character depth. Ending achieves thematic finality but leaves conceptual questions underexploited.</comment>
