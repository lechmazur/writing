<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (impassivity, personal impersonality) are stated but underdeveloped; motivation to "witness grace" lacks psychological grounding; internal transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters under word limit: hurried pacing, underdeveloped cause-effect between bee mimicry and emotional breakthrough; abrupt shifts from contemplation to climax weaken resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (fruit scent, bees' hum) immerse reader; abandoned cathedral/orchard contrast creates evocative atmosphere, but setting's symbolic potential remains partially unexplored in driving narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery (twist tie as talisman) and thematic intent (grace as tangible force), but relies on abstract symbolism over concrete emotional stakes; ending feels conceptually heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly lyrical passages border on purple prose; "secret language of bees" leans into mystical tropes without subversion; emotional shifts feel imposed rather than organically rendered through character voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements like bees and cathedral create intrigue, but narrative lacks structural economy; brevity highlights underdeveloped connections between character psychology and symbolic action.</comment>
