<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters remain symbolic rather than fully realized; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action or internal logic. The "aggressively kind" trait lacks concrete behavioral evidence, and the dancer's transformation feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plotted with mechanical precision but lacks narrative texture; cause-effect relationships are logical yet feel imposed rather than organically earned within the tight constraints. The circular structure (beginning/end at lighthouse) lacks emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt, whale call) create vague atmosphere but spatial logic falters—haunted watch room's physicality remains indistinct. The "brazen calm" tone is inconsistently maintained, undercut by melodramatic descriptions of the observer's "aggressively kind spirit."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Uses literary devices at surface level (melancholic metaphors, symbolic objects) without subtextual depth. The theme of tradition vs. modernity feels forced through explicit statements rather than enacted through character psychology or setting-specific conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Exhibits AI hallmarks: excessive reliance on poetic abstraction ("whispers of the sea"), clichéd juxtapositions ("brazen calm"), and flat emotional arcs. Attempts at lyrical prose often devolve into vague, generic imagery that obscures narrative specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements are ticked off checklist-style without achieving narrative synergy. The lighthouse setting and whale call feel like arbitrary containers for abstract themes rather than setting-specific storytelling. Overall effect is decoratively atmospheric but conceptually hollow.</comment>
