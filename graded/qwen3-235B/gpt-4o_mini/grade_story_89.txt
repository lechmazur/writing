<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's zeal and motivation are clear but lack depth beyond revolutionary fervor; reliance on symbols over nuanced internal conflict limits complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Simple arc (digging → discovery → resolve) satisfies word constraints but lacks layered progression; transitions are coherent but occasionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes mysticism but disconnects the observation deck's cosmic framing from the earthbound action; sensory details are sparse and uneven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indispensably woven; premise holds potential but execution remains conventionally heroic rather than innovatively thematic.</comment>
