<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but shallow; "lazily ambitious" trait inconsistently manifested. Alliance with rival feels unearned and lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but feels rushed. Climax with rival lacks tension, yet ties beginning and end cohesively within constraints. Cause-effect progression adequate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly evoked through sensory details (moss-covered fountain, creaking stairs) but deeper setting-object connections (dentist's drill significance) are underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some effective imagery ("whispers of the past") but thin emotional resonance. Theme of collaboration/resilience hinted but insufficiently developed. Ending feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains formulaic elements (quartet-as-gossip-device). Language occasionally ornate without purpose. Nuanced subtext missing despite surface originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy. Style leans into atmospheric prose without achieving memorable distinction required for top-tier publication.</comment>
