<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are named but underdeveloped; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through complex choices. Actions align with traits but lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression feels compressed; the action of "shaping" via neon lights lacks internal conflict or obstacles. The parade's remnants and DVD serve as underexploited narrative catalysts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ethereal grit is inconsistently rendered: neon glow and DVD reflection show sensory promise, but the "fairy light repair shop" remains generic. Timeframe feels tacked-on rather than atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Themes of hope vs. cynicism are explicit but under-layered; metaphors lack originality. Ending's emotional resonance is diluted by didacticism. Central conflict resolves too easily.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic abstraction ("twilit affirmations") and repetitive adjectives ("relic of time," "jaded hearts"). Tonal shifts lack grounding. Metaphors feel accessible but unoriginal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not fully integratedâ€”e.g., "fairy light repair shop" serves minimal thematic purpose. The brevity works against narrative depth, leaving themes unsubstantiated.</comment>
