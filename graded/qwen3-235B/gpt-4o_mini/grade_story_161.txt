<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Inconsistent depth in motivations; traits like vigilance and punctuality influence actions but lack layered exploration. Emotional arc feels rushed and simplistic, with sudden tonal shifts from sardonicism to determination that缺乏 nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predictable three-act structure within constraints, but pacing falters during abrupt transitions. The plot pivots on the seal discovery and demonstration, yet the resolution feels forced due to insufficiently earned emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Conflicting atmospheres between sterile facility and familial mythos undermine immersion. Sensory details (scent of paper, peacock glint) are sparse and disconnected from Clara's internal turmoil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on overt "show vs. tell" rather than organic symbolism - the peacock metaphor is hammered home didactically. The collective healing resolution rings hollow without prior establishment of volunteer relationships.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stilted integration of elements (orchardist in test facility), overwrought descriptions ("sardonic glee masking deeper motivations"), and a conspiracy theme that reads like surface-level mysticism rather than culturally rooted subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Element integration is mechanical - the facility serves no thematic purpose, while the seal and peacock become narrative sledgehammers rather than subtle tools. The truncated ending attempts profundity without earned emotional investment.</comment>
