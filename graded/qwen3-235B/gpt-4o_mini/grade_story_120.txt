<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality hindered by clich√©d phrases ("symphony of raindrops") and predictable time-loop framework; trauma and acceptance themes need sharper, more unconventional execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story is emotionally coherent but structurally uneven; speculative elements feel half-realized, weakening overall impact for a competitive literary market.</comment>
