<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Calm doomsayer trait is inconsistently portrayed; surface-level motivation to "slam a door" feels clichéd. Skateboard's symbolic connection to lost innocence is clear but underexplored in character's actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Resume action drives plot but execution feels rushed. Train whistle as catalyst is abrupt, lacking emotional buildup. Arc exists but resolution lacks depth beyond clichéd "call to adventure."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop's sensory details (oil, wood) are evocative but disconnected from narrative momentum. Timeframe's hush atmosphere works but underutilizes potential thematic interplay with stagnation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Emotional impact exists but leans on overused metaphors ("train whistle as rebirth"). Ending evokes liberation but lacks subtext beyond surface narrative. Some effective imagery, but uneven showing/telling balance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing ("placid ferocity," "chaos of life") verges on purple prose. Relies on archetypal tropes (workshop inventor, skateboard nostalgia) without subversion. Train whistle and stagnation gods feel like generic signposts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elements are superficially present but shallowly integrated. Tone inconsistency between melancholy and inspirational clichés. Leaves little lingering resonance despite thematic aspirations.</comment>
