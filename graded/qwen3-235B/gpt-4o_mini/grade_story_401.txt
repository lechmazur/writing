<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; motivations are implied more than deeply dramatized, with emotional shifts relying on stated reflections rather than embodied actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels compressed; pivotal emotional beats occur off-page (e.g., Mara friendship collapse), weakening causal throughlines within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create immersive atmosphere; the decaying ship mirrors internal states with poetic precision, though some descriptors risk over-saturation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric framework (blanket as emotional record) works conceptually but execution lacks depth in showing emotional transformation; ending provides resolution but feels slightly premature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally substitutes lyrical abstraction for concrete specificity; emotional weight sometimes conveyed through statement rather than subtext, with uneven stylistic consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere in service of theme but with varying effectiveness; sunken ship and blanket are masterstrokes while wilderness guide role remains contextually vague; length feels simultaneously constrained and contemplative.</comment>
