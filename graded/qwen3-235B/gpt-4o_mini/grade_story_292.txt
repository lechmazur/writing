<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's dual identity as raider/storyteller lacks psychological depth; motivations stated more than dramatized. Finn's intervention feels contrived rather than earned through organic character dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predictable three-act structure telegraphs every beat; talent show conceit stretches plausibility for raider community. Resolution feels abrupt rather than satisfyingly paced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Speakeasy setting suffers from generic sensory details ("flickering lights," "whiskey") without distinctive textures that might ground the fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (maps, shards) operate at surface level; emotional payoff feels engineered rather than emerging from lived-in details. Dialogue leans on inspirational platitudes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on redemption-through-art clich√©s; performances-as-mirrors trope lacks subversive edge. Overuse of "pulse," "thrum," "echo" verges on rhythmic repetition without rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements service plot mechanics more than thematic cohesion; raises questions about storytelling's redemptive power without interrogating them. Memorable only in execution, not concept.</comment>
