<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character shows some depth through regret and longing but remains one-dimensional due to insufficient exploration of motivations beyond surface-level nostalgia. Emotional transformation feels rushed without layered justification for his yearning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but lacks complexity. The storm and mirror interaction drive the narrative, yet the pivotal transformation relies on a single magical-realist image without sufficient emotional groundwork to justify the abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Steampunk setting offers atmospheric foundation with vivid sensory details, but world-building leans on clich√©s (gears, vapor clouds). The mirror's connection to the protagonist's profession lacks thematic integration beyond symbolic surface-level parallels.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Employment of mirror symbolism and metaphorical fire imagery elevates craft, but emotional resonance is diluted by predictable thematic beats (midlife reinvention). Ending feels underdeveloped despite competent technical execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Imagery occasionally veers into ornate descriptions without purposeful restraint. The parallel lives trope is unsubverted, and the transformation arc follows algorithmic predictability rather than emotionally nuanced, human-scale reckoning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Competent integration of assigned elements creates a functional narrative, but lacks boldness to interrogate deeper tensions between craft and ambition. Lingering emotional impact is modest, with themes feeling familiar rather than provocative.</comment>
