<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character transformation is clear but underdeveloped; motivation to be a 'guardian' feels somewhat abstract rather than stemming organically from specific past experiences; emotional complexity and psychological realism need deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a redemptive arc but feels compressed rather than fully realized; yodeling inciting incident lacks sufficient psychological groundwork; pacing is efficient but some narrative beats feel rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting description is present but surfaces are generic rather than immersive; the rainforest village doesn't significantly influence character decisions or narrative momentum; sensory details lack specificity to create distinct atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is present but not profound; metaphors (sheet music = past) work but aren't strikingly original; theme of redemption through art is clear; ending feels purposeful but not particularly memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s; yodeling as transformative act shows creative thinking; avoids formulaic emotional expression through the physical act of singing rather than mere introspection; slight issues with overly ornate descriptions but generally purposeful language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Most elements integrate cohesively but not seamlessly; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; some creative combinations of elements elevate the narrative; leaves some thematic potential unexplored but overall satisfying.</comment>
