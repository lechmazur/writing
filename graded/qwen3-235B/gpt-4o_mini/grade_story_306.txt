<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation to reclaim her identity is clear but lacks complex emotional nuance; her reactions to fame's decline feel superficial despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Liminal setting transitions (chamber, theater) create cohesion, but the resolution feels abrupt; the map's purpose is underdeveloped within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust of forgotten theater, shimmering glass) create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors internal conflict, though vibration chamber's significance remains murky.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors about time/identity are effective but over-explained; ending's message about self-discovery lacks subtextual complexity; emotional impact diluted by sentimental phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on redemption-through-self-discovery trope without subversion; purple prose (e.g., "dust and nostalgia enveloping her") undermines otherwise inventive imagery like vibration-as-memory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper thematic integration; concise execution sacrifices psychological depth; theme of fame's cost remains underexplored despite strong setting-work.</comment>
