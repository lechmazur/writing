<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Minstrel’s motivation to connect with “silent cosmos” lacks psychological depth; rivals’ feud feels contrived without generational nuance. Rubber stamp intervention reads as contrivance, not organic character choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot resolution via cloud-pattern epiphany feels rushed and illogical. Cause-effect between stamp and rivalry dissolution unearned; atmosphere overpowers structural cohesion in brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Neon/skyscraper imagery vivid but undercut by dissonant “horse stable” element. Sensory details (neon, coffee hum) immerse but timeframe (coffee lines) underdeveloped as cultural anchor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Sky-as-tapestry metaphor recurs but lacks subtextual richness. Dialogue stilted; resolution of conflict tells rather than shows. Theme of unity through ambiguity poorly contextualized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes (futuristic stables) but slips into “feudal families” cliché. Language occasionally purple (“pierced the clouds”), and cloud-reading rationale feels algorithmically whimsical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements (stamp, rivals, stables) coexist awkwardly. Brevity highlights disjointed worldbuilding; tone shifts from melancholy to whimsy without justification. No lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
