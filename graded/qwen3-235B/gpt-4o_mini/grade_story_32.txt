<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has vague, abstract motivations tied to "simulated reality" but lacks psychological nuance; role as memory sentinel described but not demonstrated with concrete decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning-middle-end structure but feels static; coin toss action drives progression yet lacks narrative stakes or transformative arc within limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, melancholic atmosphere achieved through tactile details (faded ink, dusty ground) but timeframe "between shows" disrupts setting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Echoed music and coin tosses as storytelling devices are inventive and thematically resonant; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction without grounding in embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors occasionally lapse into clich√© ("heartbeat" coin tosses); avoids major tropes but strained logic in "melody from coin toss" method feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy; poetic style elevates narrative but can't fully mask underexplored character psychology and abrupt conceptual leaps.</comment>
