<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth; introspective but static. Serene’s motivation is clear but her internal conflict lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent but lacks tension. The plot resolves neatly, but the connection between the wristband and the harbor feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evoke a muted mood; sensory details are present but over-reliant on clichéd metaphors (e.g., harbor as mirror) without deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with surface themes of memory and discovery, but lacks emotional resonance beyond imagery. Ending is tidy but shallow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors but repetitive phrasing ("whisper," "tapestry") and predictable themes. Quilt unraveling as plot device feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Polished but derivative. Elements function cohesively but lack transformative insight to elevate it to prestige-tier.</comment>
