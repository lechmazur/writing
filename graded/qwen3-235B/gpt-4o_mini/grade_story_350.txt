<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to uncover truth is consistent, but emotional depth relies heavily on symbolic objects rather than nuanced reactions. Voice lacks distinctness despite introspective narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc is logically complete within constraints, but the transition from discovery to transformation feels hurried. Cause-effect is clear but lacks layered progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eerie, evocative setting amplifies isolation and artistic rebirth themes. Sensory details like "cold stone" and "silken gown" effectively anchor mood, though symbolic weight occasionally overshadows organic worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (gown tears as puppet strings) elevates thematic resonance. Emotional impact is undercut by abstract resolution ("symphonies of truth") that leans on lyricism over visceral human stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Writing occasionally veers into overwritten descriptions ("symphonies of truth") and predictable motifs of artist-as-outcast. Fresh metaphors (e.g., grief-as-stitchwork) exist but are diluted by uneven tonal shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility (e.g., Greek templeâ€™s relevance, sudden focus on gown). Conceptual ambition is evident, but brevity leaves some threads underexplored despite atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
