<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Edgar's "lovably grumpy" trait surfaces in grumbles but lacks deeper integration into his decision-making; his accidental mayoral status has little narrative consequence beyond surface quips</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overheard conversation method contradicts prompt (orchard vs. crowded cafe); plot lacks clear cause-effect beyond sentimental awakening; pacing uneven with abrupt monk conversion</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (beetle=resilience) function adequately, but emotional impact diluted by overused "light in darkness" imagery; theme of communal change remains surface-level didacticism</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding leans on swamp-monk tropes; inconsistent scale between carnival's grandeur and isolated orchard; "water wisdom" exposition veers toward moralistic telling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting and concept show promise but lack synergistic cohesion; overwritten atmospheric flourishes undercut emotional authenticity; promising elements undercut by formulaic narrative arc</comment>
