<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from submissive to determined is credible but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within constraints, but the pivotal decision lacks tension; the sparrow-to-agent connection relies on coincidence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details unevenly distributed; the secret agent workshop blends awkwardly with aristocratic imagery, weakening both.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (sparrow, letter opener) add depth, but dialogue feels expository; theme of liberation is explicit, not earned through nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on genre tropes; the letter opener/sparrow symbolism is fresh, while "echo chambers" and espionage feel borrowed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially, but tighter integration could elevate thematic resonance; style occasionally prioritizes ornament over impact.</comment>
