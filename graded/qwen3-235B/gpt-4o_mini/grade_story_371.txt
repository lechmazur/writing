<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation exists peripherally, but lacks the depth to make Jax feel fully realized. His "fervent apathy" is stated but not consistently demonstrated through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Minimalist plot structure reaches closure but relies heavily on sentimental resolution rather than organic narrative progression. The assigned action feels more symbolic than narratively functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details about neon, rain, and market chaos. However, the cyberpunk setting lacks distinctive world-building that would differentiate it from generic dystopian tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Symbolic marbles work effectively, but emotional beats occasionally veer toward sentimentality rather than earned poignancy. Dialogue remains serviceable but unmemorable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre conventions - cyberpunk decay, heirloom relics, innocent-child-mends-broken-man trope. Descriptions occasionally slip into overwritten "dying stars" clich√©s rather than maintaining consistent original voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in uneasy coexistence rather than seamless integration. The forced brevity works against deeper exploration of key themes despite competent execution of basic narrative arc.</comment>
