<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation surfaces through symbolic interactions but lacks psychological depth; internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses via atmospheric cues over narrative momentum; the piano's role unifies the arc but transitions feel compressed in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the glass desert amplifies existential themes; setting is both haunting and integral to character introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (butterfly, tarnished fork) evoke layered themes; lyrical prose and emotional subtext elevate the story beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original imagery balances poetic abstraction with clich√©d spiritual tropes; avoids overt formulaicity but occasionally leans on familiar emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story hinges on cohesive interplay of elements, though some (e.g., the piano) serve theme more than plot; concise length enhances reflection but limits character resolution.</comment>
