<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "outlaw" and "poet" remain superficial; motivations (curiosity, redemption) lack nuanced internal conflict or evolution. Actions (e.g., sudden transformation into a poet) feel inconsistent with underdeveloped outlaw identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has a basic arc but feels rushed. The dice’s significance and shifting walls are introduced without organic causality, leaving key turns (e.g., poetic evolution) underexplained. Pacing drags in rehearsing/ambivalence sections but rushes the slam’s emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Steampunk dome is decorative but disconnected from narrative. The café’s atmosphere relies on vague "whispers" and shifting walls but lacks visceral sensory detail. Magic system (walls transforming text) feels arbitrary rather than integrated into the setting’s logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evokes mild curiosity about self-discovery but lacks subtext or thematic complexity. Emotions are largely told (e.g., "ignited a fire") rather than shown through action. The ending’s "truth" is stated, not earned, limiting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (cursed objects, outlaw redemption arcs) without fresh subversion. Some phrases ("whispers of secrets") feel overused, while the steampunk-meets-poetry setting leans on aesthetic clichés. Character reasoning (Jett’s sudden clarity) lacks human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements feel imposed rather than organically fused. The steampunk setting, dice, and slam exist parallel to each other, diluting narrative cohesion. While the redemptive arc is clear, the brevity doesn’t deepen themes—leaving ideas rather than impressions.</comment>
