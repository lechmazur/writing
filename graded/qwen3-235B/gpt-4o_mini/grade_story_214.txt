<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation ties to loss and self-redemption, but depth lacks nuanced psychology; reactions to sea glass are effective but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc and cohesion, but pacing feels slightly rushed; beginning/end connect through thematic resonance rather than narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive; setting (floating observatory) interwoven with psychological state and metaphor (light/shadow, isolation/connection).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is present via layered symbols (sea glass, black hole), but some ideas are stated overtly; ending achieves thematic closure over narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses some fresh metaphors and specific details, but risks overwritten lyricism (“black hole of doubt”) and predictable emotional beats; avoids clichés unevenly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole, but certain components (e.g., timeframe) feel underutilized; tone and imagery elevate the piece despite minor contrivances.</comment>
