<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara’s impulsiveness is demonstrated but insufficiently developed; motivations are clear but lack emotional depth; actions align with goals but character feels archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but rushes the resolution; cause-effect relationships are logical yet lack tension; pacing is uneven, with abrupt conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory details create an immersive setting, but the fortress and waterfall feel more atmospheric than integral to character or theme; connections to emotional inheritance could be deeper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coherent but formulaic integration of assigned elements; elements serve the plot but lack narrative innovation; ending lacks lingering resonance or complexity.</comment>
