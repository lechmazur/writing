<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's loyalty is present but underdeveloped; her shift to meditation feels abrupt. Motivations partially connect to her actions, but internal logic lacks depth. The journal reveals fears but doesn't fully anchor personality. Dialogue minimal; inconsistent voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning/middle/end but pacing uneven. Friends' comedic routines feel tacked on. The outage drives setup but isn't interwoven effectively. Final crash lacks narrative weight despite tying elements together. Cause-effect between meditation and resolution appears forced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Moth imagery creates visual atmosphere but setting feels superficial. "Sanctified dread" conceptually present but poorly realized - lacks tangible dread. Sensory details (moth wings, journal warmth) are specific but sparse. Atmosphere supports theme moderately but doesn't deepen character motivation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Moths-as-resilience metaphor is surface-level. Ending provides closure without emotional resonance. Themes of inner balance vs. external chaos present but under-explored. Relies heavily on abstract language rather than showing transformation. Conflict remains intellectualized, not visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Contains machine-generated tendencies - repetitive phrases ("storms brewing", "chaos transforming"), overused metaphors ("tapestry of struggles"). Overly formal vocabulary ("sanctified dread") feels artificial. Emotional beats told rather than shown. Predictable arc of inner turmoil→meditation→revelation follows template without innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially connected but lack narrative synergy. The moth tower feels arbitrarily chosen rather than essential. Meditation motivation appears imposed rather than organically developed. Symbolism lacks layered meaning that would create lasting impact despite thematic intentions stated in conclusion.</comment>
