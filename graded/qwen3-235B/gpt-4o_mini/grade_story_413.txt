<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's listlessness is established but lacks psychological depth; motivation for seeking joy feels underdeveloped despite clear trajectory from nostalgia to transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but relies on contrived devices (mysterious invitation) and rushed emotional arc; coherence maintained within constraints but feels artificially structured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric setting with vivid sensory details effectively evokes haunting beauty; however, the "haunted plain" and corn maze function more as backdrop than active narrative force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cliches about noble melancholy and redemptive gatherings softened by competent prose, but lacks stylistic audacity or subversive depth to transcend familiar tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Packs assigned elements cohesively yet superficially; length constraints expose underdeveloped themes; emotional resonance remains surface-level despite ambitious subject matter.</comment>
