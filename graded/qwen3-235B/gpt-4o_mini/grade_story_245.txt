<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (yearning for redemption) but underdeveloped; the irate smuggler traits are inconsistently shown, with emotional shifts feeling abrupt. The chopstick’s significance is established but lacks deeper exploration of why this particular object holds weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a beginning (search), middle (journey), and end (resolution) but pacing feels rushed. The "heart's revolt" concept vaguely drives the plot, and cause/effect for Jax’s decision to seek waterfalls lacks visceral immediacy. Shift from flight deck to terrain is too abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting is described with sparse visuals (rusted panels, cold air) but fails to create immersive sensory engagement. The abandoned spaceport’s contrast with the natural waterfalls—a missed opportunity for thematic tension—remains superficial, undermining the juxtaposition’s potential impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tea leaves and chopstick function as effective symbols, but the ending leans on clichéd "self-discovery" tropes. The theme of authenticity vs. deception is present but lacks subtext. Emotional impact is muted by overly explanatory narration ("The heart's revolt was not just a metaphor").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids egregious purple prose but contains predictable phrases ("canvas waiting for patterns to emerge") and underexplored metaphors. Jax’s introspective voice feels occasionally forced, and the tea-leaf prophecy reeks of convenience rather than organic revelation. Subtlety around emotional shifts is lacking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story incorporates all assigned elements but often forces them. The spaceport’s role is underutilized, and jogging as a method feels arbitrary. Potential for thematic resonance exists but is undermined by rushed pacing and surface-level exploration of "heart’s revolt."</comment>
