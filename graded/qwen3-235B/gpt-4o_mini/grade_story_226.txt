<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character development is serviceable but thin; Elias' gloominess drives the plot but lacks psychological depth. His shift from obsession to realization feels abrupt without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compression: black-market exchanges and alliance-building feel rushed or glossed over. While the story has a resolution, the arc seems schematic rather than organic within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere with sun-bleached decay and haunting echoes, effectively using sensory details. The skull's placement in the desiccated grove and resonance facility create a cohesive mood of desolation and spectral longing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (skull as memory vessel) and metaphorical resonance effectively, particularly in the ending's synthesis of remembrance/release. Emotional impact is undercut by somewhat didactic thematic statements rather than fully embodied subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("haggard awe," "tapestry of shared despair") that feels calculated. The lullaby-ancestor connection shows creativity but risks pseudo-profundity through unsubstantiated mysticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not transformative; the skull and lullabies work best. Resonance facility and "containing echoes" feel superficially conceptualized. The ending achieves thematic closure but lacks lingering narrative resonance.</comment>
