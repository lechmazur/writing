<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation between blacksmithing and paddleboarding; emotional stakes underdeveloped despite "professional wildness" attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven: transitions between Elara's past/present lack causal urgency; the 400-word constraint strains the arc's completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ozone monitoring station's sensory potential (chemical smells, machinery sounds) squandered; atmosphere oscillates between nostalgic and clinical without synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (waves/metal, flag/resilience) stated overtly rather than embodied; ending's "silent promise" feels emotionally performative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overused phrases ("weight of time," "dance of metal") and abrupt tonal shifts (children's laughter vs. quarantine) suggest formulaic drafting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Strained synthesis of elements: Ozone station and paddleboarding remain conceptually isolated; theme of "cost" underexplored.</comment>
