<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent emotional depth; character voice lacks distinction despite introspective moments. Reliance on genre tropes undermines psychological nuance, leaving motivation feeling imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rushed transitions between contemplative moments and confrontation. Plot arc is structurally complete but lacks causal density; pivotal interactions lack necessary buildup within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Generic dystopian atmosphere with underdeveloped sensory immersion. Neon/decay imagery repeated without contextual specificity to deepen mood or character-world connection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Surface-level metaphor deployment. Emotional stakes remain abstract; symbolic elements (label, avalanche) hint at depth but are undercut by didactic dialogue and unresolved thematic tensions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Combines tropes (haunted spy, post-traumatic growth) without subverting expectations. Metaphors conventional; narrative voice shifts unnaturally between detached and melodramatic registers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements service minimal cohesion but lack alchemy. Story remains competent but unremarkable within genre conventions; fails to transcend component parts through innovative synthesis.</comment>
