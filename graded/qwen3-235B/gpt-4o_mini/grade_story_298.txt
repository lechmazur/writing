<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Lian's chameleon nature and emotional motivation are stated but underdeveloped. The doll's dress adds symbolic depth to her connection to lost innocence, but her "rationally impulsive" trait lacks tangible manifestation in key decisions. Motivation is clear but somewhat abstracted from concrete action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weakness: Plot structure feels diffuse despite the word limit. The cold-case mysteries shape the play's premise but remain ambiguously resolved. Pacing is uneven - emotional crescendo feels rushed, and cause-effect between her character development and the mysteries lacks narrative teeth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strength: The decrepit palace theater's atmospheric details (sunlight through debris, tattered dress) create evocative sensory immersion. Weakness: The "ancient Chinese" setting relies on vague orientalist aesthetics rather than culturally specific details that would deepen the emotional resonance or conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: The metaphoric weaving of "emotional honesty into illusions" is thematically cohesive. The meta-commentary on art as resurrection elevates the narrative. Weakness: Some emotional beats rely on lyrical abstractions rather than visceral details that would fully activate the "show don't tell" principle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: Avoids overt clich√©s in character psychology and blends historical with metaphysical elements. Weakness: The phrase "anxious serenity" feels artificially constructed rather than organically emerging. Some atmospheric descriptions border on ornamental without advancing character or theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through core metaphors but lacks narrative urgency. Many elements (chameleon acting, cold-case mysteries) feel conceptually rich but under-realized. The ending achieves thematic resonance but minimal emotional payoff due to compressed structure.</comment>
