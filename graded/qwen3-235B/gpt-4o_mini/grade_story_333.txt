<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elara’s rebellion and sincerity are stated but lack depth; motivations are clear yet underexplored, with generic voice and minimal emotional nuance undermining development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Basic plot structure is complete but rushed, with abrupt transitions (e.g., shadow’s sudden appearance) and a predictable, underdeveloped climax detracting from coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create mood, but overused tropes (“whispered secrets”) and weak thematic ties to the “between storms” timeframe dilute originality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre tropes (haunted passages, ancestral spirits) with minimal subversion; language occasionally verges on purple prose, with repetitive phrasing undermining individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; predictable structure and superficial thematic exploration suggest formulaic construction despite atmospheric strengths.</comment>
