<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leo’s naivety is stated but inconsistently demonstrated; his motivation to “capture one last spark” lacks psychological depth, and his interaction with the candle mold feels symbolic but underdeveloped. The professors’ dialogue dominates, overshadowing Leo’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear arc but feels truncated, with abrupt shifts from lectures to candle-making. The ending—extinguishing the candle—feels contrived, undercutting the emotional weight of Leo’s realization. Pacing is uneven, with excessive focus on setting over narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station’s juxtaposition of industrial decay and candlelit mysticism is evocative, with strong sensory details (wax scent, howling wind). However, the dock as an action and the candlelit dinners timeframe lack narrative integration, feeling peripheral rather than foundational.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The story leans on clichéd symbolism (light vs. darkness) and moralizing platitudes about addiction. The professors’ chaotic energy and Leo’s abrupt choice to stop gambling lack subtext, reducing emotional complexity to didacticism. The ending fails to resonate beyond surface-level themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The prose is overwritten with stock phrases (“laughter echoed through the halls,” “dancing shadows”) and inconsistent imagery (tidal power vs. candle mysticism). Metaphors like the candle as fortune feel recycled, while the professors’ dialogue veers toward caricature, undermining psychological authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The story checks assigned boxes but feels fragmented rather than cohesive. Many elements (e.g., tidal station, lectures) seem forced into the narrative to satisfy prompts, diluting thematic focus. The ending’s moralizing feels rushed and unearned, leaving little lingering impact.</comment>
