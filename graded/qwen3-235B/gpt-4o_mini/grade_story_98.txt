<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness shapes actions but transformation feels rushed; motivation to learn is clear but under-explored; ruler as symbol lacks layered integration; voice lacks distinctiveness despite third-person proximity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Action of "drifting" drives introspective plot; tapestry as method works conceptually but resolution feels abrupt; cause/effect between fear and epiphany logical but underdeveloped; pacing manages arc within word limit but feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere contrasts mundane and mystical effectively; sensory details (parchment scent, dim lighting) present but generic; secret society feels clich√©d; dog walking timeframe adds contrast but isn't meaningfully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of self-acceptance emerges through symbolism but lacks subtext; emotional resonance diluted by overt exposition; metaphors functional but unremarkable; ending resolves conflict competently but with predictable "spark of hope."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Echoes of secret society tropes without subversion; prose occasionally bogs down in ornate descriptions ("whispers of ancient secrets"); emotional arc hinges on stated feelings; plastic ruler and tapestry attempts freshness but relies on expected symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements service character arc with moderate cohesion; dog walking and secret chamber contrast underused; style leans on familiar elegiac register; brevity serves introspective focus but themes remain surface-level.</comment>
