<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Care lacks clear voice or psychological depth; motivation feels abstract rather than visceral. Assigned traits (dry-witted) don't consistently shape actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot arc is visible but compressed; key actions (confiscating rope) occur off-page. Pacing feels uneven, particularly in underdeveloped dance sequence's abrupt inclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with specific details (salt/death scents, creaking floorboards) but haunted lighthouse feels stereotypical. Setting doesn't fully earn its symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery elevates material—ceiling as "canvas for unraveling"—but emotional payoff feels rushed. Subtext about mending broken things resonates if not transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases ("echoes in corners", "salt and decay") border on stock. Some fresh metaphors (dance vs creaking rhythms), but overall more polished than inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Competent execution but lacks urgency. Elements serve concept more than theme; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful. Lingering impression is melancholy rather than revelation.</comment>
