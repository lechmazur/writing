<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear but "skillfully incompetent at finding true self" lacks full development; actions align with motivation post-inscription but introspective voice feels limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc exists within constraints but pacing uneven; sculptor’s chisel referenced lacks narrative integration; logical cause-effect but resolution feels abrupt; theme guides cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Immersive setting with sensory-rich attic; clockwork animals as potent symbols of lost dreams; atmosphere effectively mirrors protagonist’s internal state and thematic concerns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elicits introspection through metaphor; consistent theme of purpose; some heavy-handedness in conveying message; symbolism strengthens emotional resonance despite tight word limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with clockwork motif; leans on redemption trope but executes with specificity; occasional generic descriptors (“bruises he bore”) and slightly formulaic emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Most elements function cohesively but "skillfully incompetent" and chisel strike feel contrived; brevity serves theme but restricts character depth; style mostly purposeful with minor purple prose.</comment>
