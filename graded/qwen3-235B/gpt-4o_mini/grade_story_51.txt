<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Minimal arc within tight constraints, but the transformation feels abrupt. Pacing is rushed; connection between beginning/middle/end is superficially maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Static electricity garden offers intriguing imagery but is underutilized. Sensory details are sparse; the setting doesn't deepen the theme or conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relys on redemption tropes; Lila functionally serves as a clich√©d wise figure. Museum method feels implausible and unexplored. Language occasionally veers into formality without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack integration. Story feels constrained by its components rather than creatively transcending them. The ending lacks lingering impact.</comment>
