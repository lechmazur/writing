<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clara's guilt and reincarnation shape her actions, but her "tentatively fierce" trait feels underexplored beyond fleeting self-reflection. The soldier interaction hints at self-acceptance, but motivations remain surface-level cohesive without deep psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear progression from library refuge to transformative decision, but the sudden shift from soldier encounter to recipe discovery lacks organic momentum. Pacing serves the premise but feels constrained rather than purposefully condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The library’s tactile dust/light contrasts with rain’s urgency, creating tangible atmosphere. The soldier’s physicality and recipe’s exoticism anchor the world, but emotional resonance could deepen through more evocative sensory contrasts (e.g., scent of old parchment vs. imagined stew spices).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbols (incomplete soldier, liberating recipe) effectively convey redemption through imperfection. Subtle showing of Clara’s growth (clutching the soldier, defiantly gathering ingredients) elevates thematic unity. Occasional heavy-handedness in internal monologue slightly dampens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>No contrived transitions or artificial phrasing. The reincarnation conceit and guilt motif avoid easy resolutions; playful cynicism manifests through sly dialogue rather than forced quirkiness. The soldier’s symbolism leans toward poetic rather than programmatic, though the recipe’s role teeters on metaphorical nose-thumbing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements assemble into a functional thematic mosaic—the soldier’s brokenness paralleling Clara’s growth, the library fostering rebirth—but the framework feels assembled rather than organically urgent. The ending satisfies intellectually but lacks physiological resonance or urgent newness.</comment>
