<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like sentimental and spontaneous are present but underdeveloped; motivations tied to justice and chaos feel abstract rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dream-provided coordinates drive the plot but lack internal logic; beginnings/endings connect superficially, with rushed pacing and disjointed cause-effect chains.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting relies on vague historical atmosphere without sensory specificity; the Sumerian palace and storm are decorative but not thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Attempts metaphorical language ("dance with chaos") but leans on clich√©s; theme of justice lacks depth, dialogue feels simplistic, ending offers closure without resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on trope-heavy structure (ancient relics, prophetic dreams); prose occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing, with predictable emotional beats and minimal subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>Elements are superficially cohesive but strain under scrutiny; themes feel tacked-on, and the brevity limits narrative ambition.</grade>
