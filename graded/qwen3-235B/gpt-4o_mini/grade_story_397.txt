<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (understanding past, challenging fate) lack psychological complexity; generic "jaded" traits overpower unique voice; transformation feels rushed without adequate catalyst beyond clich√© epiphany.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Non-linear structure muddies cause/effect between lab setting/fireworks and character arc; abrupt shifts from scalpel examination to doodle realization; fireworks as symbolic climax feels tacked-on rather than integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Crystal growing lab lacks concrete sensory details beyond "shimmering" and "fluorescent" descriptors; atmosphere relies too heavily on fireworks as blunt metaphor rather than organic extension of setting's emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (crystals/fireworks as growth from pain) undercut by sentimental resolution; attempts at subtext (scalpel as creation tool) undermined by heavy-handed "canvas" epiphany; emotional depth remains surface-level despite ambitious thematic scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overuse of generic descriptors ("genuinely strange," "optimistic desperation"); repetitive metaphor structures; character psychology defaults to trite "buried memories" trope; atmosphere relies on predictable light/dark contrasts with fireworks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Coherence strained by overcrowded element list; concepts feel checklist-completed rather than organically intertwined; brief length exposes underdeveloped central conflict; style occasionally elevates material but frequently succumbs to purple prose.</comment>
