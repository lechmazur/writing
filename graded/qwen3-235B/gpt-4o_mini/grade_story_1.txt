<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clara's phobia shapes her actions and motivations clearly, but her internal conflict lacks deeper exploration. Her transformation feels slightly rushed despite consistent alignment with her traits, and her voice remains serviceable but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent arc driven by Clara’s discovery of the envelope, but the word limit forces underdeveloped transitions. The cause-effect chain is logical, yet pacing feels slightly strained, with the climax resolving too abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pyramid library’s atmospheric details (shadows, dust) create a vivid, haunting tone. Sensory specifics are evocative but occasionally generic, and the setting’s connection to the net’s symbolic purpose feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The net-as-metaphor for fear is effective, and the ending’s thematic resonance works. However, some emotional beats rely on summary rather than immersive showing, and subtext remains surface-level rather than layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story leans on tropes (“garage sales of discarded dreams,” “dancing on the edge of madness”) without sufficient subversion. Language occasionally veers into ornate description, and emotional nuance feels more stated than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story coherently integrates assigned elements but prioritizes symbolism over organic flow. The brief length feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with thematic closure satisfying but underdeveloped in execution.</comment>
