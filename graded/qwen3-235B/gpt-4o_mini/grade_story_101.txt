<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Arthur’s motivation to reimagine feared endings is present but lacks emotional depth; his transformation feels rushed, and his role as a "welcoming landlord" is underexplored beyond superficial traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on contrived causality (parade as catalyst feels arbitrary); pacing is uneven, with abrupt shifts between introspection and action undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in the studio contrast effectively with the vibrant parade, but the "timeframe" element disrupts atmospheric unity by adding unresolved historical ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbols like the bee pin offer thematic depth, but emotions often rely on telling over showing; the ending’s inspirational resolution feels predictable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The parade trope and tidy redemption arc lean on clichés; the bee pin subverts expectations slightly, but the narrative occasionally veers into sentimentalism and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Weave of elements is partially cohesive, but forced integration of the timeframe and parade weakens overall impact; the brevity works for immediacy but sacrifices nuance.</comment>
