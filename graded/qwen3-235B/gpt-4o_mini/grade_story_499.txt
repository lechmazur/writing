<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's duality as ghostwriter vs. poet is conceptually strong, but inner conflict lacks nuanced exploration; her actions align with motivations but emotional depth feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc from paralysis to resolve, but the orchestra's crescendo feels tacked-on as a transition device rather than organically driving the plot; pacing occasionally uneven within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungus and underground orchard create a vivid, symbolic setting; atmosphere flawlessly integrates with themes of hidden light/shadow through sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (corrosion, codex stanzas) and imagery elevate the text; resolution feels emotionally satisfying but lacks deeper subtext about identity commodification in political systems.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh setting prevents formulaic AI rhythms; occasional purple prose ("shipwrecked journals") but generally purposeful language. Emotional resonance emerges through environment over stated interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of most elements, though sandals feel more symbolic than functional; tone balances surrealism/urgent personal transformation effectively within constrained format.</comment>
