<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s free-spirited and artistic traits are present but underexplored; her motivation to overcome shame drives her actions but lacks psychological depth and nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Linear progression from doubt to healing feels predictable; the sewing metaphor underpins the arc but lacks tension or structural complexity within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes introspection with ocean sounds and fading light, but the coral restoration station remains a generic, underdeveloped backdrop that unevenly supports thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (stitching as healing) and imagery evoke subtext about creativity and legacy, but emotional depth is undercut by frequent exposition rather than visceral showing of transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends lyrical prose with familiar tropes (e.g., “echoes of shame,” letters from a wise relative); avoids outright clichés but borders on sentimentalized self-discovery without subversive ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but derivative; elements like the sewing kit and coral station serve the narrative superficially without achieving transcendent symbolism or lasting impact.</comment>
