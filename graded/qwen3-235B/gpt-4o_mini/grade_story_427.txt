<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually tied to philosophical themes, but dialogue lacks subtle human nuance; motivations (e.g., grappling with "shifting equilibria") feel somewhat imposed rather than organically explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pivotal moments (e.g., the sock’s revelation) feel rushed; the lighthouse’s isolation compresses the narrative effectively, though the conflict’s depth is constrained by the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (e.g., "whispers of the sea"), but setting details (e.g., lighthouse) often serve as mere backdrop rather than actively shaping the story’s tension or character choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (sock, mechanical arms) adds thematic resonance, and the ending’s shared equilibrium is emotionally satisfying, though some metaphors lean into abstract vagueness over concrete impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts to subvert clichés (e.g., philosophical duels, mentors’ deaths) are undercut by overly ornate phrasing and predictable emotional beats; the fusion of mechanical and organic elements shows potential but lacks freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indispensable; the story’s ambition to blend abstraction with intimacy is admirable, but uneven execution leaves the narrative feeling like a framework rather than a cohesive whole.</comment>
