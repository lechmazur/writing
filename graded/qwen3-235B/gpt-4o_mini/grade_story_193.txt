<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prince’s exile status isn’t deeply explored, weakening motivation. His loneliness is clear but reactions to the mortar feel underdeveloped. Dialogue lacks distinct voice, leaving character feeling archetypal rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Snowstorm forces encounter, driving plot but resolving too neatly. Mortar’s symbolic role is underutilized. Pacing uneven—storm’s abrupt arrival and subsiding strain credibility, weakening cause-effect coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie, dust-choked atmosphere enhances solitude. Sensory details (cold stone, swirling snow) immerse reader. Customs office’s history connects to theme but lacks specificity—its decay mirrors prince’s emotional state, yet feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mortar as metaphor for connection is poignant. Subtext of healing through shared vulnerability resonates. Ending avoids sentimentality, balancing hope with subtlety. Dialogue natural; tension between strangers-turned-confidants is compellingly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prince’s exile and snowstorm trope lean cliché. Atmospheric descriptions avoid purple prose but mortar’s “iconic” label feels forced. Emotional resonance relies on showing (e.g., “void within”) but character reasoning often simplistic, lacking nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack synergy—story leans on archetype-heavy setup (lonely prince, sudden storm). Brief length limits depth but ending’s warmth suggests thematic intent. Misses full originality but offers minor emotional subversion of “cure for loneliness.”</comment>
