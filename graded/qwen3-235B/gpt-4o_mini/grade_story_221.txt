<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent connection between Clara's profession as a wreck-diver/ghost whisperer and her actions. Motivation to "step out of the shadow" lacks layered justification, though the amber interaction reveals emotional entrapment effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear arc from grief to resolution within word constraints, but pivotal emotional transitions feel rushed. The amber drives the internal conflict effectively, though cause/effect between object and decision rely heavily on metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival evokes strong atmosphere with sensory decay details (peeling paint, ocean scent). Faded joy contrasts with current melancholy, but underused potential of environmental symbolism for Clara's profession.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Amber as symbolic parallel to Clara's trapped emotions and brother's influence is effective. Ending achieves emotional resonance but leans heavily on stated transformation rather than subtle showing of changed behavior.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but borrows familiar grief-processing tropes. Language remains purposeful without florid excess, though Clara's dual profession stretches believability. Metaphors (frozen insect, thawing heart) border on conventional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements assembled cohesively but lack organic fusion. The carnival setting and amber serve as effective containers for themes, yet character's profession feels externally attached rather than integral to narrative momentum.</comment>
