<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's shyness is underexplored in actions; motivations (cosmic imbalance) are clear but lack emotional depth. Assigned traits (passionate disinterest, diviner) inconsistently manifested.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rushed progression from relic discovery to cosmic resolution; pacing uneven in tight word limit. Concept (regret, timelines) shapes plot but lacks payoff clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clichéd aquatic imagery (algae, silence); sparse sensory details weaken immersion. Setting disconnected from social media method.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads of fate) overused; themes of redemption surface but lack complexity. Ending feels abrupt but hints at hope.</comment>
