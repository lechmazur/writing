<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's traits (hesitance, awkwardness) and motivation (restoring traditions) are superficially clear but lack psychological complexity. Growth feels abrupt rather than earned; internal conflict is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but simplistic, relying on static introspection rather than dynamic action. The "final piece of evidence" and hermit crabs nominally propel the narrative but fail to create meaningful cause-and-effect momentum within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (geothermal heat vs. cold, crab imagery) create mood but do not organically drive the story. The setting's eccentricity (tundra orchard) distracts more than it amplifies the theme of tradition-eroded-by-modernity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (postcard as bridge, crabs as role models) are functional but derivative. The ending's thematic declaration ("tradition and progress coexist") feels forced rather than organic to the narrative's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally defaults to earnestness rather than subversive originality. Phrases like "flicker of hope" and "ephemeral rancor" lean on poetic abstraction over visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is marginal: elements are present but feel assembled rather than inseparable. The premise's potential for philosophical depth remains underexplored, leaving the story teetering between pretension and insight.</comment>
