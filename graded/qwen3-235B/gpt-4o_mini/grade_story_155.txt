<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Underwater welder background informs character's tactile connection to relics but motivation to "wield improbable power" feels underexplored; "patiently impatient" trait surfaces only intermittently without deep psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Button press as action drives plot but the compressed timeline leaves the middle section underdeveloped; shifts between nightclub and memories lack causal clarity in bridging Eli's past/future selves.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Broken planetarium-turned-club provides rich metaphors for cosmic disorientation but visual/auditory details (e.g. "kaleidoscope of memories") occasionally verge on abstract overindulgence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of buttons/mirrors to interrogate time's non-linearity; the theme of honoring past selves through "unraveling" offers philosophical weight despite rushed emotional crescendo.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on poetic abstraction ("hum of forgotten dreams") rather than distinctive voice; some phrases ("whisper secrets of the past") risk clich√© despite inventive core concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weaves assigned elements into a thematically unified parable about time but lacks technical polish; the brief form suits contemplative tone yet sacrifices deeper character/textural complexity.</comment>
