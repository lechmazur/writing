<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters lack psychological depth; Felix’s transformation feels rushed and undermotivated. Mira’s dialogue serves exposition rather than revealing personality. Interactions rely on archetypes without nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a predictable arc with contrived pacing. The computer's reactivation feels like a deus ex machina rather than a natural progression. Thematic closure lacks complexity, though the ending maintains basic coherence within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting blends post-apocalyptic decay and organic renewal vividly, though the "gentle harshness" tone remains unevenly realized. Sensory details immerse readers but occasionally verge on sentimentalized decay clichés.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Storytelling relies on recognizable themes of redemption and connection, but emotional impact is diluted by conventional metaphors ("spark of hope") and explicitly stated emotions rather than subtextual revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Contains moments of originality (reclaimed skyscraper orchard) but leans on meet-cute tropes and redemptive arcs without subversion. Dialogue occasionally feels artificially polished rather than authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine logically but lack transformative integration. The story demonstrates technical competence but fails to transcend genre expectations or offer distinctive artistic vision.</comment>
