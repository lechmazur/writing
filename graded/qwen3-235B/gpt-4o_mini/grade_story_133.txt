<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; Elias’s jaded-to-inspired arc is underdeveloped, relying on vague motivations. Dialogue hints at connection but lacks emotional nuance or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear, predictable trajectory with abrupt transitions. Pottery class to studio feels contrived; the tight word limit exposes a lack of meaningful conflict or payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (scent of fruit, rooftop labyrinth) but underutilized. Atmosphere enhances mood but fails to integrate fully with the plot or themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (gloves, art as weapon), but symbolism feels superficial. Ending lacks resonance; tension between past/future remains unexplored. Prose is evocative but struggles to convey deeper meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on familiar motifs (forbidden power, lonely artisan) without subversion. Sensory details are specific but occasionally overwrought; dialogue borders on cliché. Avoids worst tropes but lacks innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated. Setting and gloves stand out, but the story feels like a sketch for a larger idea, hindered by inconsistent focus and pacing.</comment>
