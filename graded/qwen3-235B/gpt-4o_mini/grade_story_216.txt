<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as a scapegoat lacks depth in action/reaction; motivation hinted through symbols but backstory/nuance absent. Voice remains generic despite introspective premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear arc from burdened scapegoat to rebirth, but pacing stumbles: library closure feels underutilized, midnight calls lack stakes, transformation occurs abruptly without organic conflict escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cloud city imagery (flickering lights, fog) creates mood but setting rarely influences character decisions; symbols on washer deserve more visceral sensory linkage to enhance thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (washer as paradox) work but climax feels shallow: emotional catharsis relies on vague declarations rather than concrete actions or symbolic object payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Whispers wrapped like fog" and "fire of determination" veer into cliché; scapegoat trope remains unchallenged; tone often descends into vague poeticism over psychologically specific choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely integrated – washer’s symbolism outpaces other assigned components; story leans on atmospheric scaffolding rather than organic cohesion.</comment>
