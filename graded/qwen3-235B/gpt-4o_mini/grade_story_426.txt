<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated; motivation is clear but underdeveloped through actions. "Secretive pathfinder" remains undefined in plot significance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is present but simplistic; haunted train sequence feels disconnected from marathon framework. Resolution is abrupt yet thematically consistent</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative through sensory details but setting's relevance to folk medicine theme remains superficial. Ghost train's symbolism lacks depth</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors exist but feel surface-level (teapot, marathon). Emotional resonance relies heavily on telling over showing. Theme of preservation emerges but lacks complexity</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Secretive pathfinder" and "hacking playlists" feel arbitrarily chosen. Folk medicine and teapot show more originality. Tone inconsistencies between aloofness and passion</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but elements strain toward deeper meaning. Atmosphere lingers, but thematic integration of marathon training and ghostly encounters feels forced</comment>
