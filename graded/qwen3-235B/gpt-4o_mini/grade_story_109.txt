<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alaric’s coldness lacks nuance and his transformation feels abrupt, while motivations shift without sufficient grounding. The mitten’s role in revealing character depth is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Basic arc exists (mission → mitten encounter → resolution), but lacks momentum. The folk remedies are mentioned yet irrelevant to the emotional pivot; pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Icy urban night atmosphere contrasts with knightly tropes, but anachronistic secret agent center undermines cohesion. Sensory details are intermittently vivid but disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance with the girl works, but themes of healing/artistry are superficial. Symbolism (mittens, altars) gestures toward ideas without depth or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Blends medieval/modern tropes without irony; the knight’s redemption arc feels predictable. Language occasionally veers into purple prose (“wave of artistic awakening”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing. Underdeveloped themes and tonal clashes hinder cohesion; the ending prioritizes sentiment over resonance.</comment>
