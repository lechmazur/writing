<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; monk's motivation feels abstract rather than visceral. Dialogue fails to fully differentiate his voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot resolution dependent on convenient glowing key deus ex machina. Pacing uneven; cosmic event teased but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague "crumbling facades" clich√©s. Sensory details unevenly applied; tapestry of sound lacks concrete description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors (key as trust) undercut subtlety. Emotional payoff understated to point of detachment. Central conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original setting diluted by trope-laden elements (wandering monk, mystical artifacts). Language occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction rather than purposeful precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story achieves surface cohesion but lacks revelatory synthesis between elements. Premise feels constrained by format rather than deliberately compressed.</comment>
