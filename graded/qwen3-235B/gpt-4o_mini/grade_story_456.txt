<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Elara's "neutrally passionate" trait lacks concrete behavioral demonstration through consistent actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative follows a loose arc but lacks tension; the "writer's trunk" method creates structural inertia rather than driving plot forward meaningfully within the limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively rendered through candlelight imagery and cosmic metaphors, though sensory details remain narrowly visual rather than multidimensional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Themes are stated more than shown; symbolic elements (candle, dojo) lack sufficient subtextual complexity to sustain lasting impact despite poetic language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overuse of abstract descriptors ("whispered secrets of the cosmos") and generic metaphors weakens originality; some phrases exhibit patterned repetition suggestive of formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion but elements feel like checklist fulfillments rather than organically integrated components; thematic depth remains superficial despite lyrical prose.</comment>
