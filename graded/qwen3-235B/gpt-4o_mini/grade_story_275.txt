<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Hermit's mysteriousness lacks depth; motivation to revitalize land is present but underdeveloped; rebellious attribute applies to a secondary character, weakening core character consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows chronologically but lacks narrative tension; cause-effect between choices and outcomes is abstract; resolution feels abrupt despite cyclical structure mirroring "mindful choices" theme.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ethical atmosphere from comet/orchard contrast works, but sensory details are generic (e.g., "shimmering air"); setting's supernatural elements don't fully integrate with character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and symbolic motifs (weathervane as cyclical renewal, flowers as memory) present, but emotional impact diluted by passive protagonist; theme of renewal is clear but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into overdescriptive abstraction ("deliberate wilderness"); weathervane's "exact angle" translation is a fresh concept undercut by implausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements (comet/orchard, weathervane) create cohesion but lack thematic synergy; short length serves mood better than narrative complexity; resonant yet familiar themes limit longevity.</comment>
