<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation lacks specificity, actions feel vaguely symbolic rather than organically connected to character's history, insufficient interiority to establish a distinct voice or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists but feels compressed; catapult resolution appears abruptly without sufficient setup of group intentions; core concept isn't integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually evocative but inconsistent atmosphere; atom-power and time-refugee elements aren't technologically/socially contextualized; sensory details remain surface-level rather than world-building through character perspective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (tablecloth as heritage, lighthouse as hope) function effectively but rely on clich√©d imagery; ending achieves symbolic resonance but lacks earned emotional weight due to narrative brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ('whispering secrets', 'borrowed light') borders on purple prose; some atmospheric elements feel algorithmically generated rather than authorially intentional; character decisions lack psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements incorporated but unevenly weighted; story scaffolds around checklist rather than organic synthesis; brief length undermines thematic development and character transformation.</comment>
