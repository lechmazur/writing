<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivations lack emotional depth and organic evolution; her transformation feels abrupt despite the abstract conflict. Clear traits exist (astronomer, rational) but aren't fully woven into nuanced decisions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure follows a contemplative arc but relies on vague epiphany (snowflakes = emotions) rather than plot-driven progression. Pacing is uneven; resolution feels rushed despite thematic cohesion between veil discovery and resolve.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes create a haunting, atmospheric backdrop. Sensory details (cold, fluttering veil, crystal shadows) evoke mood effectively, though deeper integration with Elara’s internal journey is needed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (veil = lost love, snowflakes = impermanence) are visually striking but conceptually thin. The ending hints at theme (embracing impermanence) without fully exploring emotional complexity, relying on poetic abstraction over narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uses clichéd tropes (idol of fear, ghosts of love) with overly ornate language that borders on purple prose. Some connections (astronomer studying patterns) show creativity, but emotional authenticity feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; the metaphor-heavy approach prioritizes style over structural cohesion. The brief form stifles deeper exploration, leaving themes and character arcs feeling abbreviated.</comment>
