<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Lila’s transformation feels convenient rather than earned through nuanced action. Marco’s role lacks depth beyond narrative function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a coherent arc but suffers from rushed pacing—key emotional beats (e.g., confession) feel abrupt due to word constraints. Resolution is tidy but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly sketched but inconsistently immersive; the hourglass setting and fading chalk lines evoke mood but aren’t tightly woven into character or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Impactive use of metaphor (e.g., pencil sharpener as honesty symbol) and lyrical prose, but dialogue and emotional beats often verge on cliché. Theme of connection lacks layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesion is strained; many elements feel appended rather than organically integrated. Story relies on predictable tropes (redemption through love, music as healing) without subversion.</comment>
