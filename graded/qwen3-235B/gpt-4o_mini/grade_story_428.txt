<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's shift from city planner to prepper lacks sufficient psychological grounding. Motivation to "escape self-imposed chains" feels abstract rather than earned through specific actions. Ink blotter symbolism attempts to bridge past/present but remains superficial. Minimal dialogue prevents establishing distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Narrative hinges on handshake deal but lacks meaningful cause-effect; plot progression feels contrived. Fragmented structure mimics broken constellations but sacrifices coherence. Pacing rushes through philosophical shift without earned emotional payoff. Timeframe device feels gimmicky rather than thematically essential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative details (candlelight, temple ceiling) establish mood but fail to integrate with plot mechanics. Setting works as atmospheric backdrop but doesn't actively shape character decisions or thematic concerns. Sensory elements lean toward generic "ancient temple" tropes without specific cultural anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Attempts thematic resonance around authenticity vs survival but relies on clichéd symbols (broken constellations as fractured psyche). Subtext remains underdeveloped. Writing style fluctuates between purple prose ("daring caution") and flat exposition. Ending feels narratively hollow despite aspirational language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on AI-comfortable tropes: mysterious hooded figures, ancient temples, existential prepper narratives. Metaphors strain for profundity without specificity. Emotional beats (doubt, nostalgia) told rather than shown. Writing avoids overt clichés but substitutes formulaic introspection. Sensory details feel curiously generic for "pivotal" objects.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Story fragments under pressure of too many assigned elements. Some creative combinations (ink blotter as authenticity symbol) but overall cohesion suffers. Brief form exposes underdeveloped conflict. Lingering impression of checklist-driven construction rather than organic narrative.</comment>
