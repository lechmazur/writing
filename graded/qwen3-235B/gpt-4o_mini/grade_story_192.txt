<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clara's motivation for connection is clear but underdeveloped; her reactions align with her trait but lack emotional nuance, particularly in her interaction with the ghost. The "eager lookout" aspect is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels rushed, especially the sudden poltergeist progression and Clara’s realization. Logical gaps exist in how the "corral" method drives the narrative. Pacing uneven but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The villa’s atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently tied to the digital-age contrast. Sensory details (marble, crimson thread) enrich the setting, but the "ruthless kindness" tone clashes with the ethereal apparition, undercutting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of the sewing box as a memory vessel and the "threads that bind" metaphor are effective. Emotional resonance is present but undermined by explicit theme-stating. The ending offers closure but lacks subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on supernatural tropes without subversion. Overly ornate prose ("whispers of history," "ruthless kindness") borders on purple prose. Some fresh ideas (e.g., juxtaposing digital isolation with tactile history) but undercut by predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are tied together, but the "wager of faith" and "poltergeist analysis" feel forced. The digital-age motivation and sewing box are cohesive, yet the story’s brevity limits thematic depth. Lingering reflection is mild.</comment>
