<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond archetypes; motivations are clear but underdeveloped, with little emotional nuance connecting his swordsman identity to his actions. The sudden shift to tech-based innovation feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but suffers from rushed pacing—critical transitions (e.g., activation of device, city collapse) lack escalation subtlety. The beginning/end connection is strong, but internal logic strains under time constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (marine decay, salt-electricity contrast), but bird songs underwater create tonal dissonance. Sensory details mostly immerse, though some setting elements feel arbitrarily juxtaposed rather than thematically unified.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of individuality vs. conformity resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on abstract phrases ("essence of stars") over concrete character experiences. Memorable imagery balances uneven subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality hindered by clichéd "forbidden innovation" structure and generic cosmic horror undertones. Some phrases ("lucid frenzy," "symphony of the cosmos") verge on purple prose. Scavenging TVs for signals lacks plausible integration into world logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but prioritizes aesthetic over narrative necessity—the underwater garden and cosmic quest feel like colliding metaphors. Length exposes underdeveloped character motivations despite strong atmospheric economy.</comment>
