<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character shows surface-level internal conflict but lacks deep motivation alignment; the reckless hunter trait is inconsistently demonstrated, and his transformation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot concept is clear but constrained by tight word limits; pacing feels rushed during pivotal moments, weakening the emotional arc's impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is effectively rendered with rich sensory details, but the setting’s eerie enchantment isn’t fully leveraged to deepen thematic or character resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Storytelling uses metaphor well, with the lens as symbolic clarity. Dialogue is purposeful, but emotional depth is undercut by a simplistic "wisdom through connection" resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (wise strangers, sudden epiphanies) without subversion; some poetic phrases feel formulaic, and the resolution lacks psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack integration; the theme of wise choices feels imposed rather than organically explored through the narrative.</comment>
