<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Insufficient exploration of "intelligently foolish" motivation; shapeshifting talent exists as superficial trait rather than defining characteristic influencing decisions; inconsistent emotional realism in reactions to figurine and cosmic balance concept</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Structural coherence disrupted by abrupt transition from caves to taxi; overthrow plot catalyzed too conveniently by single conversation; cosmic balance shift lacks clear cause-effect logic within word limit</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overly generic "harmonic caves" lack distinctive acoustics or magical properties; rain-as-metaphor repeats without developing unique atmospheric qualities; sensory details remain thin and predictable</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved superficially but not deeply compelling; elements function primarily as plot devices rather than thematic connectors; short length exposes underdeveloped concepts</comment>
