<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's confusion is consistently portrayed, but her motivation to "liberalize hearts" lacks depth. The spare key's symbolic role feels underdeveloped, and her shift from timidity to resolve is abrupt without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bus journey structurally binds the narrative, but the conflict resolution is overly simplistic. The transition from hesitation to inspiration via birds feels rushed, undermining the arc's emotional impact within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt mine's eerie atmosphere is evocatively sketched with sensory details like "damp air" and flickering lights, but the setting's potential to deepen tension or character is underutilized. The birds' presence lacks integration into the village's physical world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bird metaphor is a clear organizing device, but the theme of "joyfully tragic" unity remains superficial. Emotional beats are stated rather than dramatized; the ending's transformation feels unearned despite resonant imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting shows originality, but the "flock of birds" motif is clich√©. The spare key verges on symbolic overreach, while the "boldly timid" tone is inconsistently rendered. Overly lyrical phrasing ("joyfully tragic counterpoint") occasionally borders on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story cohesively incorporates assigned elements but strains under their weight. Creativity in linking birds to diplomacy exists, but the tight word limit exposes underdeveloped threads. The ending satisfies superficially but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
