<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing feels rushed during mine exploration; ritual's preparation lacks procedural detail; beginning/end connection exists but underdevelops temporal urgency; cause/effect between cure research and artifact acquisition remains logically sound but under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned mine's sensory details (mildew, pulsing shadows) create immersive atmosphere; setting enhances isolation but timeframe element plays no active role; Viking artifact's connection to location lacks historical grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ending's "double-edged sword" epiphany feels derivative, though the feverish pursuit of knowledge creates tension; writing shows more than tells through environmental reactions but relies on clich√©d "forbidden knowledge" themes.</comment>
