<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's stoicism is clear but under-explored; motivation to defy conformity is logical but lacks depth due to brevity. Internal conflict feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to structure but relies on a conventionally tidy arc; pacing is efficient but the pivotal decision lacks nuanced causal buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but underutilized; sensory details evoke mood, yet the miniature world museum’s potential to deepen theme is only partially realized.</comment>
