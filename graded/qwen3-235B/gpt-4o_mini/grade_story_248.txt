<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's "unsteady" nature remains superficial; motivations tied to prophecy are clear but lack psychological depth or believable nuance, particularly regarding the underdeveloped "coyly furious" trait which feels arbitrarily applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates basic structure and resolution, but the compressed arc relies on abstract epiphany rather than earned progression; cause-effect between letter-reassembly and prophecy clarification feels underdeveloped despite functional pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Visually evocative setting with effective sensory details, but the space freighter environment remains atmospheric backdrop rather than integral element; "cheerless ecstasy" tone lacks sustained thematic connection to character's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Makes thoughtful use of symbolism through automaton bird and prophecy, but relies on telling rather than showing emotional states; ending provides intellectual satisfaction over visceral impact, with themes of resilience hinted rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical prose elevates the piece above formula, but contains overworked phrases ("whispering secrets of forgotten journeys") and inconsistent metaphors; emotional beats often stated rather than naturally emerging from narrative, with some mechanical transitions between key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative coherence maintained through tight focus on core elements, though brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; combines assigned components with superficial ingenuity but leaves thematic potential underexplored rather than prompting sustained reflection.</comment>
