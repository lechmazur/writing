<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions; motivations lack depth in explaining why puzzles or spiritual tracking; transformation feels abrupt without sufficient behavioral progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a circular arc with rising tension, but pacing compresses the emotional depth; the connection between beginning/middle/end feels logical if somewhat conventional within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but surface-level, relying heavily on clichéd isolation tropes; sensory details are present but not consistently specific or grounded in the lighthouse environment's unique qualities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolism are effective but derivative, creating emotional resonance without transcending familiar thematic territory; writing shows skill but lacks distinctive stylistic individuality worth noting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Feels partially formulaic with overused themes of isolation and self-discovery; while avoiding major clichés, metaphors and structure lack freshness; emotional expression remains somewhat surface-level despite poetic language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story holds together structurally with intentional brevity, but cohesion suffers from uneven integration of elements; some assigned components feel appended rather than naturally woven into narrative momentum or theme.</comment>
