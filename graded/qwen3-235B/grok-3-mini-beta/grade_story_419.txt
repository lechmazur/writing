<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's traits are stated but not deeply embodied; motivations feel abstract rather than rooted in lived experience. Actions align with traits but lack emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; resolution arrives too neatly, with underexplored tension. Pacing prioritizes brevity over emotional depth or logical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly sketched but atmospheric potential is unevenly realized; sensory details lean overly on visual cues while neglecting other senses for full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (heartbeat, light) are effective but not transcendent; theme of continuity is clear but lacks subtextual complexity. Ending feels resolved but underwhelmingly poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Language veers toward ornamental abstraction; repetitive syntax and abstract descriptors (“whispered secrets,” “steady heartbeats”) suggest formulaic tendencies despite some originality in concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but lack interplay that feels organic; style’s formality occasionally muffles emotional specificity, though the premise invites deeper exploration.</comment>
