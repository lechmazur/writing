<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits like "neutrally passionate" and "boldly timid" are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior; motivation to understand cosmic cycles is clear but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a spiritual arc efficiently but feels compressed; cause-and-effect between reading the trunk and transformation is logical but underdeveloped for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sets an evocative, ethereal mood through vivid imagery (e.g., "floating rock dojo," "wilted blooms"), but sensory detail is overly reliant on sight with minimal tactile/auditory specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of cosmic metaphors (petals as microcosms; candle wax as renewal) elevates the theme, though emotional resonance is undercut by abstract, repetitive phrasing like "fading stars."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dreamlike prose occasionally veers into purple prose ("gravity whispered secrets of the void"); some motifs (cycles, decay) feel over-explained rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; the florist motif and cosmic cycles blend poetically but would benefit from tighter structural compression for the brief format.</comment>
