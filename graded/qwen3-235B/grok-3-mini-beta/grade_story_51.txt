<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterization has poignant symbolism but lacks layered internal conflict; voice feels slightly forced and overly metaphorical rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc implied but pacing compresses crucial growth moments; coincidental "accidental meetings" strain plausibility within tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ethereal setting brilliantly merges with thematic subtext; static electricity as psychic manifestation is particularly striking and immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong conceptual metaphors but surface-level emotional rendering; symbolic fire ritual compensates for underdeveloped transformation process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery undercut by pretentious abstraction ("rationally subjective energy"); some AI-like conceptual convolution without human emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually rich but execution uneven; successfully intertwines most elements though with noticeable thematic over-explanation rather than intuitive revelation.</comment>
