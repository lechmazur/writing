<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a symbolic vessel for themes; motivation is clear but emotional depth feels abstract rather than embodied through specific choices or contradictions. Unique identity remains philosophical concept rather than lived reality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but suffers from compressed pacing that undermines emotional stakes. Coin-toss method feels conceptually intriguing but mechanically underdeveloped. Resolution sacrifices narrative weight for poetic conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually atmospheric with strong opening imagery, but setting doesn't organically interact with character actions. Ghost town becomes decorative rather than functional, missing opportunities to make the environment mirror psychological states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (melodies as memory bridges) and resonant theme of authenticity vs. simulation. Some telling over showing, but ending achieves emotional complexity. Central conflict resolved too cleanly for philosophical material.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original in synthesis of elements (coin melodies, simulation escape) but relies on cyberpunk-esque tropes without radical subversion. Language occasionally becomes ornate distraction ("harmonious rift tearing fabric of reality"). Emotional resonance stays surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coherently unites assigned elements but often feels more like literary exercise than urgent storytelling. Strong imagery lingers, though human connection remains elusive. Ambivalent tension between freedom/loss conceptually satisfying but emotionally distant.</comment>
