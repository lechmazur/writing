<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract archetype with minimal distinguishing traits beyond vague weariness; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose emotional arc with clear beginning (entrance to house) and end (transformation), but the metamorphosis remains overly abstract; cause-effect between sign's tapping and psychological shift lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through precise sensory details (salt scent, metallic cadence) and thematic setting cohesion, though the carnival's symbolic weight occasionally strains credibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor overload the narrative; emotional impact feels manufactured through repetition rather than earned progression; themes of rebirth are clear but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overreliance on abstract phrasing ("hammered repose"), clich√©d metaphors ("dance of imprisoned fireflies"), and excessive thematic signposting suggest formulaic construction rather than organic storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ideas cohere into a poetic whole but lack narrative urgency; stylistic flourishes overshadow character depth; the brief form feels limiting rather than deliberate.</comment>
