<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poor integration of grumpiness as a defining trait; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced connection to character's actions. Inner conflict depicted but lacks visceral, distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure effective within constraints but pacing falters with abrupt transitions between introspection and action. The mandala's symbolic function drives coherence but feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich visual language (crystals, sand) creates atmosphere, but setting elements feel archetypal rather than original. The intersection of witchcraft and crypt-caretaking lacks contextual depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (sand patterns as trauma) resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract language. The theme is coherent but lacks visceral immediacy. Ending resolves but feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Overuse of stock phrases ("subtle grandeur") and repetitive abstract descriptors ("fractured memories"). Some fresh imagery (tube as symbolic vessel) but undercut by purple prose tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive whole but rely on thematic shortcuts rather than narrative depth. The brevity works conceptually but sacrifices emotional specificity. Lingers as metaphor but not character resonance.</comment>
