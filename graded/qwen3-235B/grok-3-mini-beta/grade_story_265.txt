<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's stoicism is consistently portrayed but motivation to 'witness grace' lacks emotional depth; transformation feels underexplored, and voice remains inconsistent during introspective moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot flows poetically but sacrifices coherence; oil changes drive mechanical plot elements but lack integration with themes, while cause/effect between bee-dancing and climax remains abstract despite satisfying imagery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create immersive decay-meets-growth atmosphere, but cathedral/orchard juxtaposition strains belief; stained glass sunlight beam effectively anchors symbolic revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors about rigidity/stretches work well, and ending resonates thematically; minimal conflict tension weakens impact, though poetic craftsmanship and layered meaning about perception elevate the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s and maintains stylistic consistency, though some ornate constructions ("verdant canopy that sprawled across ancient rafters") border on affectation; bee symbolism offers freshness but occasionally veers into artifice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive thematically despite contrived elements (oil mechanics integration), with brevity serving atmospheric compression; lingering emotional/philosophical resonance present but inconsistent across components.</comment>
