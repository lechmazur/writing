<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbols than fully realized individuals; Echo's robotic logic dominates over nuanced motivation or emotional complexity. The child's role as catalyst lacks development or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear, impressionistic structure prioritizes mood over plot. The retreat resolves nothing tangible; cause/effect relationships exist primarily in poetic abstraction rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually stunning fusion of ancient and digital elements creates immersive atmosphere. Sensory details like rusted coils and lantern arcs masterfully build mood that transcends plot limitations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness (math/monuments) lingers. Ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional payoff. Strong use of symbolism, weaker on traditional storytelling mechanics like conflict-resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original concept execution tempered by occasional purple prose and overly-ornate phrasing. Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but still operates at times like a "literary" template rather than organic creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully binds core elements into cohesive tone poem, but lacks traditional narrative urgency. Elements serve atmosphere over character/story development, which works but doesn't reach publication excellence.</comment>
