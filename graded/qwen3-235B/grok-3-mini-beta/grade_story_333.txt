<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks nuanced internal conflict; traits stated rather than demonstrated through actions/emotions. Motivation feels abstract, not rooted in tangible history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rushed pacing undermines the emotional weight of revelations; sudden resolution feels unearned despite clear beginning-middle-end structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the "shift and whisper" walls and storm symbolism are overused, diluting their impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "braided bitterness" are conceptually interesting but over-explained, leaning into clich√© rather than subtext. Ending lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("braided bitterness," "shadows and echoes") suggests formulaic writing. Gothic tropes are unrefreshed, emotional beats feel pre-packaged.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack visionary cohesion; the story lingers more as a checklist exercise than a profound narrative.</comment>
