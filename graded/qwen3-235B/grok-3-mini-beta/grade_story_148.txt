<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (storm chaser, inner strength) inform actions but lack visceral connection; motivation for carousel restoration feels underexplored despite thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure clear but predictable; cause-effect between tapestry decoding and emotional arc feels mechanically engineered rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (mountain air, monastery bells) create vivid atmosphere; desert past occasionally referenced but insufficiently contrasted with present setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (carousel, tapestry) operates on literal level but lacks subtextual complexity; ending resolves too neatly for maximum emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overwritten descriptors and "quiet strength" tropes verge on clich√©; metaphors effective but insufficiently subversive of genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid integration of elements, though some (tapestry decoding) feel obligation-driven rather than organically necessitated by character psychology or plot logic.</comment>
