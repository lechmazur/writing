<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and "predictably odd" traits are superficially displayed but lack psychological depth, with internal conflicts and motivations insufficiently dramatized through action or credible transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fragmentary progression within tight constraints struggles to balance setup, development, and resolution; key narrative beats (e.g. device creation) feel abbreviated, weakening emotional payoff despite a clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting fragments undercut atmospheric cohesion; "wounded season" time frame remains underexploited, while sensory details often feel decorative rather than thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric potential (self-discovery as deep-sea exploration) remains under-realized; themes gesture toward transcendence but fail to achieve the complexity implied by layered storytelling devices.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally succumbs to portentous phrasing; self-reconstruction premise shows ingenuity but execution straddles edge between poetic ambiguity and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structural coherence achieved through deliberate pacing gaps, but thematic ambition exceeds execution; brevity serves as both constraint and canvas for unresolved narrative tensions.</comment>
