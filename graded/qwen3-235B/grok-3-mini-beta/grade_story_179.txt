<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (envious longing) is clear and consistent, but psychological complexity remains underdeveloped; assigned 'forcibly gentle' attribute feels imposed rather than organically embodied in nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot driven by fingerprint interpretation creates intriguing premise but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between microscopic patterns and hive mobilization lacks sufficient narrative groundwork within constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, sticky wax) create vivid setting, but beehive's physical specifics don't tightly integrate with plot mechanics; atmospheric potential exceeds functional integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Literary devices (ruler symbolism, echo motif) present but unevenly developed; thematic tension between envy and sacrifice resonates but emotional impact diluted by abstract statement over concrete embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids common tropes through unusual combinations (microscopic mobilization, jubilant remorse), but some ornate phrasing borders on purple prose; characterization occasionally slips into psychological over-explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but unevenly weighted; atmospheric strength contrasts with pacing awkwardness; ambitious thematic layering occasionally undermines narrative cohesion within brief execution.</comment>
