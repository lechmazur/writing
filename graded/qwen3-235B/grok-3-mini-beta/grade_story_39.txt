<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character possesses clear traits and arc, but motivations feel simplified by the strict redemptive arc; the blend of deception and sincerity lacks nuanced exploration of internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has direction but feels compressed; pivotal shifts (e.g., redemption) lack sufficient emotional groundwork, and the conclusion strains credibility within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Immersive Martian biodome atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details, but the bookshop’s connection to the broader setting feels underexploited, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (lantern, cameos) and layered themes of renewal; emotional resonance is undercut by the abruptness of key transformations, though the ending lingers effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging Martian survival with spectral allegory, but reliance on redemption tropes and phrases like “tapestry of resilience” veer toward cliché; pacing occasionally feels calculated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but strained by the tight word count; some connections (e.g., bookshop mysteries as catalyst) feel underdeveloped, though the story’s thematic ambition is laudable.</comment>
