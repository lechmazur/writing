<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's disgruntled demeanor and scars hint at depth but are overwhelmed by excessive abstraction; motivations feel half-formed despite consistent ties to ghosts and espionage themes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot flows directionally but struggles with pacing in constrained space; shadow-guided revelations feel contrived, weakening cause-effect logic despite a clear beginning-to-end arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through visual descriptions of shadows and carved stone, but lacks textured sensory details to ground its mystical espionage setting in visceral reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (coins as burdens, scars as armor) resonate superficially, but themes lack sustained emotional complexity; ending feels abrupt rather than transcendent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Purposefully cryptic language borders on purple prose; inventive concept (espionage well) undermined by over-reliance on clich√©d phrases ("storm of old scars") and uneven tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven narratively but lack conceptual surprise; brevity works for mood but hinders thematic payoff.</comment>
