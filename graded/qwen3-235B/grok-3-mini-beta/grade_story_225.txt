<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits like "unjustly fair" and butterfly-tracking motivation are consistent but underexplored; emotional reactions to the highlighter pen or Morse code feel arbitrary rather than revealing deep psychology; voice lacks distinctive personality despite first-person framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on erratic cause-effect (accidental Morse code love, sudden literal infection) with incoherent pacing; butterfly-tracking as plot driver collapses into melodramatic toxin subplot; ending resolution feels abruptly imposed rather than earned through prior setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine details ("brass-lit," humming gears) create vivid but surface-level atmosphere; tone swings between "battered" grit and poetic whimsy clash; sensory details like fogged portholes are effective but insufficiently connected to character's inner world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emotional impact comes from metaphorical parallels (butterflies as fleeting love) and ironic twist of healing toxins; some effective imagery but overwritten in moments like "digital whisper"; central theme of unconventional love resonates despite weakly resolved conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overuses ornate metaphors ("fragile bloom in depths of steel") and generic descriptors like "battered wonder"; character reasoning (sudden love via Morse code) feels illogical; shifts between poetic abstraction and sudden plot twists suggest structural formulaicism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements crowd narrative cohesion; plot often feels constructed around checklist rather than organic development; style oscillates between lush prose and abrupt shifts; lingering impact diluted by unresolved thematic threads.</comment>
