<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly sketched; curiosity feels more like a surface trait than a multi-dimensional force driving nuanced decisions. Limited emotional depth revealed through interaction with the bracelet or journals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains structure within constraints, but pivotal moments (e.g., bracelet activation, spirit revelations) feel rushed rather than earned. Pacing fluctuates between poetic meandering and abrupt shifts, straining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush but overburdened with abstractions ("loudly serene," "politely anarchy"). Sensory details dazzle visually/audiovisually but lack visceral specificity (e.g., mangrove mud's texture, decay's smell) to ground the surreal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (footprints, bracelet as key) are undercut by reliance on self-consciously poetic phrasing. The theme of bridging life/death through subversive curiosity resonates, but emotional engagement remains intellectualized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vividly unconventional elements clash with repetitive phrasing ("whisper of forgotten souls," "vanished after a single heartbeat") and tonal whiplash between grandiosity and opacity. Some AI-adjacent stylistic tics (e.g., forced oxymorons) detract from organic innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Broadly cohesive but unevenly weighted; elaborate setting and symbolic objects occasionally overwhelm narrative momentum. Thought-provoking theme emerges, but brevity highlights as many unresolved tensions as intended ambiguities.</comment>
