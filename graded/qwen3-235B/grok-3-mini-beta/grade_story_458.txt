<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character feels archetypal and emotionally abstracted; motivations are conceptually clear but underdeveloped in terms of personal stakes beyond thematic abstraction; spiritual secularity is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced choices; coffee-stain prophecy lacks organic connection to established traits</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure but lacks tension due to minimal character agency within the compressed timeframe; cause-effect relationships between prophecy and action are abrupt; ending attempts thematic resonance but feels disconnected from earlier narrative beats</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport is vividly described but functions superficially; tone of 'fractal sorrow' becomes a conceptual crutch rather than atmospheric foundation; limited sensory engagement beyond visual decay metaphors</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical depth (recursive sorrow, bridges as traditions) and symbolic objects show potential, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction; ending gestures at thematic complexity but doesn't fully resolve</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive conceptual repetition ("fractal sorrow," "bridge to unity"); flowery abstraction often supersedes concrete imagery; emotional states are frequently named rather than dramatized; coffee stains as prophecy device reads as arbitrary</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overambitious element integration sacrifices cohesiveness; worldbuilding and symbolism often feel decorative rather than integral; compressed format struggles to balance conceptual density with narrative momentum; thematic resonance remains surface-level</comment>
