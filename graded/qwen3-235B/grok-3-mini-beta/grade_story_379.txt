<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; themes of redemption are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. The protagonist's internal conflict lacks sufficient showing through concrete behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but feels compressed; cause-effect is logical but emotional beats arrive too abruptly for full resonance within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Meets baseline element requirements but struggles with cohesion; the story’s full potential is diluted by mechanical integration of assigned components.</comment>
