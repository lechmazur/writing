<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her self-taught wizardry lacks narrative demonstration of struggle/learning. Compassion is stated rather than dramatized through specific choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the ricochet drives momentum while the resolution occurs abruptly. Pacing uneven in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Virtual reality archive has vivid visual texture, but sensory details beyond sight are underutilized. "Elegant chaos" tone is inconsistently applied beyond descriptions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are generally cohesive but serve checklist; VR archive's integration feels more functional than inspired. Style is purposeful but inconsistently nuanced.</comment>
