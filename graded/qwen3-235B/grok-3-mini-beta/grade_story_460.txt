<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character defined more by symbolic weight than depth; assigned traits shape her actions superficially, but reactions to objects lack psychological nuance. Motivation remains abstract rather than emerging organically from behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot exists as a fragmented meditation rather than a driven narrative. The feather and puzzle box initiate action but lack causal urgency; pacing feels meandering despite lyrical cohesion between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually oppressive acid rain forest establishes constant physical and metaphysical threat; environment actively shapes character hardship and thematic tension through corrosive, tactile details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery elevates the text but over-reliance on abstract metaphors dilutes emotional immediacy. Theme of resilience through brokenness emerges clearly, though concept occasionally outweighs narrative substance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose and repetitive tactile descriptors (e.g., "prickly") suggest artificial cadence. Originality exists in conceptual layering but is undercut by post-apocalyptic tropes rendered in overly literary terms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic throughlines clash with a story structure that feels more illustrative than experiential. Ambitious element integration falters under inconsistent emotional weight and atmospheric overload.</comment>
