<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are deeply rooted in grief but lack nuanced exploration of inner conflict. Symbolism (hairbrush, railways) ties well but feels more conceptual than emotionally lived. Despairing cheer manifests through abstract resolve rather than tangible behavior shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to a redemption arc but compresses emotional release unnaturally. The echo-measuring method lacks technical/logical clarity, weakening causal relationships. The arc feels conceptually complete but sacrifices visceral pacing for poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Radiowave garden's synesthetic details ("melancholic vibrancy," "spectral patterns") create haunting immersion. The setting serves dual purpose as both emotional metaphor and geographic framework, though its scientific plausibility remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor density works as both strength and flawâ€”echo-as-reckoning is profound, but layered symbolism occasionally muffles narrative immediacy. The ending resonates thematically but prioritizes thematic elegance over raw emotional grit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by moments of poetic overreach ("twisted antennae bloomed metallic flowers"). Avoids tropes in premise but occasionally relies on familiar grief-redemption beats. The "artfully messy" motif feels both innovative and repetitively deployed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but sometimes overshadow plot mechanics. The brevity allows thematic focus at the cost of deeper character grounding. Lingering resonance exists in conceptual duality but lacks visceral grounding in human-scale specifics.</comment>
