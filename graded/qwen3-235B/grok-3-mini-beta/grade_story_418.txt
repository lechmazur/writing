<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation but lacks nuanced development beyond archetypal 'headstrong' traits; emotional depth feels surface-level despite metaphorical flourishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has internal logic but rushed transformation lacks emotional payoff; cause/effect between confession and orchard feminization feels narratively convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details establish setting but tone-technique dissonance weakens 'merry bitterness'; record player's symbolic connection to plot remains underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohesively interact but feel checklist-driven; brief length highlights structural gaps in character arc development rather than enhancing narrative focus.</comment>
