<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Thorne's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; his awkwardness and hesitation inform actions superficially without deep psychological grounding or transformative arcs. Dialogue and voice lack distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing falters between poetic abstraction and narrative progression; the hermit crab method feels metaphorically tenuous, while the climactic emergence lacks clear stakes or resolution within the constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Striking but inconsistent imagery—the tundra vents create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details remain sparse and disconnected from character engagement beyond cold/heat contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (shells, rancor) evoke thematic resonance about impermanence, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on ornate abstraction rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clichéd existential themes ("restore traditions") paired with derivative surrealism; the hermit crab conceit initially refreshes but devolves into overwrought symbolism. Nuance absent in character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Element integration feels forced—geothermal vents and postcards serve primarily as aesthetic backdrops rather than shaping the plot. The ending lacks cathartic weight or ambiguity.</comment>
