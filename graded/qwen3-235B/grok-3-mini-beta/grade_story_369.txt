<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks grounded motivations; actions often feel abstracted from psychological plausibility despite vivid descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot structure hinges on atmospheric tension rather than organic progression; cause-effect logic feels metaphorically potent but narratively diffuse within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is palpable and thematically unified with character interiority, though sensory details occasionally lapse into overfamiliar maritime clichés.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is undermined by overreliance on paradoxical phrasing ("optimistically bitter") rather than earned subtext; symbolism occasionally feels labored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Originality exists in conceptual layering but suffers from generic descriptors (“churning sea,” “mysterious lighthouse”) and transitions that at times feel algorithmically smoothed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story demonstrates ambition and thematic cohesion but falls short of transcendent literary execution due to inconsistent tonal control and underdeveloped narrative momentum.</comment>
