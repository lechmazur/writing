<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually layered but voice lacks distinctiveness; motivation is clear but the shift from deceit to confronting ghosts feels under-explored and emotionally inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story follows a circular structure but relies on overwritten transitions between Elias’s introspection and ghost interactions; pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting evokes decay through vivid, if clichéd, descriptions, but dystopian specifics lack depth beyond visual tropes; atmosphere leans too heavily on “ruins” imagery without grounding in the world’s rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (tape dispenser as void) and subtext about emptiness effectively, but overwrought phrasing (“whispers lingering like echoes”) dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Combines familiar tropes (haunted farm, redemption arcs) without subversion; leans on atmospheric decay instead of fresh imagery, with moments of artificial introspection that feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack narrative urgency; story’s brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate, with themes of remorse and defeat underdeveloped.</comment>
