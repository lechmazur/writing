<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's brashness and wildness influence his impulsive actions, but motivations for preserving games feel superficially stated rather than demonstrated through lived experience or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot is driven by implausible mechanics (detonating medal via shell patterns), forced pacing compresses key moments, though the beginning/end connection to reciprocity provides minimal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "dancing dust" and flickering lights create an atmospheric, slightly eerie mood that mirrors the character's nostalgic obsession, but the discount store setting lacks narrative resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of preservation and cyclical renewal are conceptually strong, but emotional engagement suffers from overreliance on abstract concepts ("warmth of reciprocity") over embodied conflict or specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overuse of vague, flowery phrases ("dusty exuberance"; "shared flame in darkness") and predictable metaphors (detonation = renewal) undermine originality and emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story attempts to weave disparate elements into a symbolic whole but feels strained by the short formâ€”concepts outweigh execution, leaving ideas underdeveloped and momentum uneven.</comment>
