<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; rebelliousness and lost love feel stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. The protagonist remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to climax, but pivotal moments (e.g., emotional reveal of lost love) feel rushed. The 500-word constraint strains the arc's completion, leaving key transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid descriptions (shifting mask, humming organ) create an immersive atmosphere, but the revolution rumors and "giant's bookshelf" are underutilized. Sensory details sometimes prioritize ornamentation over thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Layered metaphors (labyrinth of choices, obituaries as manifestos) add depth, and the ending thematically resonates. However, emotional impact is diluted by abstract telling rather than visceral showing of the traveler's turmoil.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally veers into purple prose ("lucid frenzy of words"). The fusion of mask, organ, and revolution concepts shows ingenuity, though the rebel-artist-lover backstory feels derivative rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole but lack deeper interconnectivity. The obituary concept and manifesto theme are compelling, yet the brevity constrains the resolution of the traveler's internal and external conflicts.</comment>
