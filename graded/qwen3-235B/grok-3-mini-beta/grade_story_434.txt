<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's solitude and role as protector are established, but motivations lack psychological depth; the assigned attribute "commonly individual" remains underexplored and inconsistently manifests in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure emerges despite constraints, with flame-driven conflict propelling the narrative forward. Some pacing issues arise from compressed explanations of ancestral lore and zero-gravity mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details like pulsing stains and flickering shadows, but inconsistent integration of zero-gravity flame and underdeveloped timeframe undermine spatial-temporal cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical layering (flame as both weapon and dance) and cyclical structure work well, though emotional impact is diminished by overt exposition rather than subtler dramatic embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through specific inventions (zero-gravity flame, napkin relic). Some purple prose (e.g., "whispers lingering like forgotten secrets") and overly abstract descriptions test credibility but don't collapse narrative originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack narrative elasticity; short form exposes structural seams. Lingering questions about artifact lore and character psychology suggest incomplete thematic excavation.</comment>
