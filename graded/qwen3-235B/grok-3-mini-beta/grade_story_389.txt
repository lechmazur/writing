<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Well-structured plot within constraints but relies on familiar arc (ambition → hubris → downfall) with underdeveloped cause-effect logic in artifact's effects</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Evocative setting fragments exist but sensory details are uneven; atmosphere often relies on clichéd imagery (e.g., "spectral Vikings")</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration shows mixed intentionality; ambitious thematic cohesion exists but execution lacks distinctive authorial voice or transformative innovation</comment>
