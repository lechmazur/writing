<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but largely stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions; "uncommonly typical" provides surface contrast without deep psychological dimensionality or meaningful engagement with conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows predictable beats with functional cause-effect but suffers from compressed pacing that flattens emotional stakes; the connection between Eli's test and his rebellion feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes future and past elements effectively but relies on vague sensory details; the capsule hotel's potential as a temporal liminal space remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric imagery and the "unspoken heart" metaphor offer thematic cohesion, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract description rather than visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Originality in blending time travel with fragmented storytelling is undercut by formulaic phrases ("whispers from the past") and predictable emotional cues that lack humanistic nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack deeper symbiosis; the story hints at ethical and emotional complexity but concludes without resolving contradictions between secrecy and revelation.</comment>
