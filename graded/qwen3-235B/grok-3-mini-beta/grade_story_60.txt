<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear structure but rushed resolution; cause-effect logical, though spectral figure’s abrupt emergence disrupts pacing; concept shapes plot but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere with vivid fungal glow and cathedral shadows; sensory details present but occasionally generic; setting-object ties are underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some overwrought descriptions (“shadows twisted like ancient roots”); reliance on gothic tropes; uniqueness in ribbon and hawking action offsets minor clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but unevenly weighted; length exploited for brevity over impact; prompts addressed but not seamlessly integrated.</comment>
