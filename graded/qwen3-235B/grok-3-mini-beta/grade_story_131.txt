<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness is consistent but surface-level; emotional growth is stated rather than viscerally shown. The motivation to transform fear into courage drives the plot but lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through item discovery and the "loosen" action, but compressed pacing undermines tension. The connection between beginning (drift) and end (resolution) is logical but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly creates an eerie atmosphere with floating objects and the stones' hum, but sensory details are sparse. The tone of "affectionate detachment" inconsistently permeates the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones, chest) and the theme of adaptability are clear, but emotional impact is diluted by overt explanations. The ending resolves the immediate conflict but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés in setting but relies on predictable emotional arcs ("orphan overcomes fear"). Language is occasionally overwrought ("affectionate distance"), and subtext is overshadowed by didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively employed but lack surprising interplay. The story’s brevity works for the premise but sacrifices depth. The theme lingers faintly, though execution remains uneven.</comment>
