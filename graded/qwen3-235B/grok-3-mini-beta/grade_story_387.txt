<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's selflessness and motivation are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or internal conflict; abstract descriptors (e.g., "savage grace") substitute for substantial development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative attempts epic scope but collapses under word limit; key plot points (saboteur, holographic projection) feel rushed, with unclear cause-effect logic and abrupt tonal shifts disrupting coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., "overlapping hum of mismatched wind chimes") create vivid ambiance, but setting elements like the recycled spaceship remain superficially sketched rather than integral to the plot's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on poetic density over emotional resonance; literary devices (metaphors like "intangibly tangible") become self-indulgent, while the endingâ€™s circularity feels pretentious rather than profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Over-embellished prose ("savage grace," "warp of longing") verges on purple; some elements (e.g., nebula storms) feel templated, while emotional beats are stated rather than earned through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are superficially stitched together rather than organically integrated; the constrained form fails to justify itself thematically or structurally, leaving the story feeling fragmented rather than deliberate.</comment>
