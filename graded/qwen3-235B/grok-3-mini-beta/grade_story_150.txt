<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually tied to plot but lack psychological depth; Silas' "ambivalence" feels more thematic than internally consistent, reducing his complexity to a narrated trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of disruption and transformation, but the brevity forces rushed resolution; the dice-rolling climax and improvised ballet are narratively satisfying yet emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory blends mechanical precision with cosmic wonder, offering rich sensory contrasts. Some details (e.g., shifting coffee shop walls) strain plausibility but enhance atmospheric mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of intentional chaos and collaborative reinvention resonate, with poetic prose amplifying mood. Overreliance on abstract phrasing ("virtually peculiar") occasionally dilutes emotional impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mechanically cohesive use of assigned elements creates a visually striking, thematically coherent narrative. The ending’s philosophical tone feels earned but lacks visceral emotional payoff.</comment>
