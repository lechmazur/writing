<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Everett's motivations are ambiguously tied to his forgotten noble status, but introspection replaces dynamic development. His transformation feels abstract rather than grounded in specific actions. Psychological depth is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Fragmented structure between texts disrupts momentum. Key moments (fire, drone confession) lack narrative payoff within the constrained arc. Pacing lurches between exposition and climactic gestures without earned transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (chemicals, unstable lab) but underutilized. Sensory details overwhelm rather than clarify the setting's thematic purpose. The lab’s volatility only superficially mirrors internal states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (ticket stubs as fractured identity) and the drone’s surveillance-as-self-awareness create layered meaning. Ending lacks emotional precision but achieves conceptual resonance. Metaphors occasionally overshadow narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose vacillates between strikingly original imagery ("flames licking at apparatus") and purple descriptors ("hollow recklessness"). Subtext is deliberate but unevenly executed. Emotional beats often told rather than shown, leaning on clichéd internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ideas of self-deception and rebirth linger thematically, but cohesion falters under scrutiny. Assigned elements are present but inconsistently integral. Style occasionally undermines impact through overwrought phrasing and unresolved imagery.</comment>
