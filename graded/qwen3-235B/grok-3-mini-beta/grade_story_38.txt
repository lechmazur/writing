<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior, lacking emotional depth and consistent behavioral patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between scenes; thematic resolution feels abrupt, with underdeveloped cause-effect chains that undermine narrative cohesion within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is intermittently vivid (attic shadows, subway rattling) but inconsistent in how sensory details connect to the character’s internal journey or thematic arcs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and subtext effectively (botanical decay/rebirth), but relies on abstract generalities over concrete emotional revelations; ending risks platitudinous resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes border on overwrought; some fresh imagery (e.g., "empty abundance") diluted by clichéd elements like the haunted attic and unresolved AI-like tonal inconsistencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are superficially woven together without deep interconnectivity; thematic ambition outweighs narrative execution, resulting in a polished but hollow veneer.</comment>
