<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Some integration of Mira's memory-tasting ability into her trauma, but lacks nuance in how this sensory gift fundamentally alters her perception of relationships or cooking. Motivation (severing ties) is clear but forgiveness feels abruptly resolved without profound psychological shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Linear structure with symbolic climax at pitcher's mound, but pacing lags due to repetitive metaphors ("exasperated" repeated 5x) and excessive focus on synthetic organic details that don't advance the arc. Open-field meandering weakens stadium setting's narrative potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Striking tactile imagery (damp grass, mud) and synesthetic flavors, but "yodeling" as setting element is inert—no sonic resonance or cultural context. Synthetically organic theme dominates sensory palette while emotional temperature remains inconsistently rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Idea-stitched metaphors (paperclip as toxic ties, rain trails as life flow) function, but emotional beats rely on summary ("felt a shift") rather than embodied experience. Salad fantasy sequence verges on abstract wish-fulfillment rather than earned closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Phrases like "synthetically organic" and "ruminative exasperation" repeat like algorithm prompts. Forgiveness theme stated overtly rather than emerging through subtext. Rain trail symbolism feels grafted, not organic to character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>High-concept parts exceed execution—chef's visions should interrogate memory ethics, not just enable sentimental catharsis. Stadium/yodeling elements decorative. Conceptual cleverness outweighs emotional truth; would benefit from tighter focus on somatic memory interplay.</comment>
