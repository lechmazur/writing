<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's nervousness and motivation are clear but underexplored; his role as a crime lord strains credibility with actions more aligned with a reformer than a hardened leader.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a functional arc but feels compressed; key moments (confrontation, seed distribution) lack sufficient buildup for emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, but the midwinter setting’s "fragile ferocity" only partially intersects with character actions and thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (seeds as resilience) and layered themes of unity vs. isolation shine, but the ending feels overly tidy for the complexity introduced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in framing rebellion via gardening and uses the xenophobic enclave with nuance; some metaphors (tyranny of indifference) border on abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the central theme but lack depth due to word constraints; the blend of crime fiction and symbolic subtext is inventive but unevenly executed.</comment>
