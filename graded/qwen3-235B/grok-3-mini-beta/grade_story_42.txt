<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth in internal conflict exploration; redemption arc feels somewhat rushed despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear beginnings/middles/ends, but pacing stumbles slightly under word constraints; skirmish resolves too conveniently.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting immerses through evocative, specific sensory details; wind turbines-as-spirits metaphor enhances tone but occasionally overwrought.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but strain under demand for depth; brevity undermines thematic complexity despite clever integration of assignments.</comment>
