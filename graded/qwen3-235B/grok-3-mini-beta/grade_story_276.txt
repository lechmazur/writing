<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (universal patterns) is clear but lacks deep emotional grounding; symbolic use of objects (coathanger, postcards) reveals growth, but introspective voice feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot uses lurch and debris proximity alarms effectively as narrative pivots, but the arc's transformation feels slightly rushed; cause-effect between postcard discovery and redemption lacks nuanced transitional beats in tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orbital debris tracking station's artificial stars and flickering screens evoke isolation effectively; sensory details like the coathanger's wire twist and postcards' "rustle" enhance mood but remain underdeveloped compared to the metaphor-heavy prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (redemption as branches, wisdom in disruptions) is intellectually resonant; the final revelation about universal patterns in mundane links is thematically satisfying, but emotional impact is tempered by abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story avoids overt tropes but risks over-reliance on poetic symbolism (e.g., "veins of redemption" in a tree); some phrases ("cold, starry outpost") veer toward familiar poeticism rather than innovating within the sci-fi frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements (picnics, coathanger, lurch) are tightly woven into thematic arc; occasionally feels constructed around assigned constraints rather than organically emerging from character psychology, but ends on a note of reflective cohesion.</comment>
