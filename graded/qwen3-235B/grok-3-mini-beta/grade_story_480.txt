<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are inconsistently woven into actions; motivations (curiosity about the supernatural, social media persona) lack psychological depth despite vivid surface descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through genre conventions but lacks tight cause-effect logic; the ritual's resolution feels abrupt despite effective integration of core elements within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with sensory details creates effective atmosphere; decayed spaces enhance tone and ritual significance through consistent tactile/historical imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story evokes fleeting contemplation of online voyeurism vs. genuine connection but relies on surface-level tension; symbolism (receipt becoming ash) resonates more than inconsistent character introspection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overuse of paradoxical descriptors ("quietly loud") and repetitive phrasing ("familiar strangers") suggests formulaic writing; attempts at subverting exorcism tropes are superficial despite distinctive stylistic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Element integration feels purposeful but strained; atmosphere and setting stand out, but emotional weight relies too heavily on stated concepts rather than organic character/story development.</comment>
