<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters' motivations partially developed with some internal consistency, but lack sufficient emotional nuance to elevate beyond surface-level dynamics; moments of growth feel hastily resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure coherent but unevenly paced within the tight constraints; key turning points are logically connected yet occasionally rushed, weakening the arc's emotional payoff.</comment>
