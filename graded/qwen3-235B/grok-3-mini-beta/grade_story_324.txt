<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Main flaws: Motivation feels imposed rather than organically earned; character arc compresses too much psychological nuance into limited space. Strengths: Insecurity directly shapes crucial action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure collapses under word count strain; pivotal vision lacks narrative scaffolding; abrupt shift from jar interaction to resolution disrupts cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of tactile decay (crumbling walls, dust) but temporal ambiguity undermines atmosphere; sensory details often prioritize mood over coherence with espionage setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements feel assembled rather than unified; thematic cohesion exists but narrative brevity strains plausibility of psychological transformation; lingering questions undercut satisfying resolution.</comment>
