<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to escape her father's legacy is present but underdeveloped; her reactions to the amber and spirits lack nuanced emotional progression, and the first-person narration doesn't establish a distinctive voice or interiority that fully aligns with her role as a ghost whisperer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the incantation-driven plot relies on under-explained mechanics, and the transition from ghostly interaction to personal transformation occurs too abruptly for the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evolves atmospheric details (dusty carnival, twilight) that evoke melancholy, but the setting’s connection to the family tradition and letter framework feels superficial rather than integral to the supernatural actions or thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambiguous metaphors (thawing heart, trapped amber) create mild emotional resonance, but stated emotions ("bittersweet peace") dominate over evocative subtext; the ending’s poetic tone distracts from underdeveloped conflicts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original elements (ghost-summoning, carnival decay) are present but often rely on genre tropes (haunted inheritances, spectral ancestors) without subverting expectations; language is clear but occasionally defaults to vague descriptors ("faint echoes") instead of vivid specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>ELEMENTAL COHESION: The carnival setting and amber symbol work best, but other elements (wreck-diver profession, family tradition) feel appended rather than organically integrated; the story’s lyrical tone occasionally masks underdeveloped relationships between assigned components.</comment>
