<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's telepathy shapes her secrecy but lacks depth in emotional/psychological consequences; her "efficiently inefficient" trait inconsistently influences actions beyond surface-level quirks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arc is present but pacing uneven—abrupt shifts (e.g., glacier linkage to workers' camaraderie) disrupt flow; thematic resolution feels rushed despite tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but disconnected—glacier/ice crystals feel superfluous to dock's grime; noble foolishness is stated rather than woven through setting details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (crystals, button hook) add depth, but emotional beats rely too heavily on explicit statements; theme of "bonds over precision" resonates but lacks nuanced payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong originality in premise (telepathic barista), but prose veers toward ornate descriptions; glacier method feels contrived; emotional subtext occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story attempts ambitious cohesion but strains under weight of assigned elements; themes linger but lack visceral impact; tone/style balance uneven.</comment>
