<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has poetic depth but lacks emotional grounding; assigned traits like "vivid dreamer" and "rationally mischievous" shape abstract symbolism rather than tangible motivations, making internal conflicts feel stylized over authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes atmosphere over progression; moon paths serve as narrative scaffolding but pacing lacks rhythmic urgency, undercutting the cosmic stakes implied in the premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Richly textured yet inconsistently threatening; statues' mechanical amusement and lunar cycles create evocative mood, but the orchard's sentient qualities aren't fully weaponized to challenge the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical mastery elevates the metaphysical mystery, though emotional impact relies heavily on lyrical abstraction rather than character-rooted revelation; ending resonates intellectually but not viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally succumbs to baroque phrasing; "dour amusement" and "cosmic deception" feel freshly conceived, though some imagery ("twisted branches") risks genre familiarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of surrealism and philosophical inquiry; cohesive in theme but uneven in execution, with poetic flourishes occasionally overshadowing narrative drive.</comment>
