<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but not fully demonstrated through actions; motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth, with internal conflict articulated more through poetic abstraction than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plotted with mechanical precision toward redemption but feels compressed and emotionally flat; cause-effects (letters → healing) rely on thematic convenience rather than organic progression; resolution arrives with insufficient narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting described in pretty clichés ("salt-kissed air") without functional integration; atmosphere leans on overused metaphors (ocean as emotional echo chamber); sensory details decorate rather than deepen narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sewing-as-mending metaphor is recognizable but unoriginal; emotional arc feels preordained; writing relies heavily on abstraction ("breathless longing") rather than tactile specificity; theme of redemption lacks philosophical complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessive, repetitive ornamentation ("academically artistic herbalist," "hollow echoes of shame") distracts; formulaic metaphors (threads=sins/memories) undermine emotional resonance; psychological realism supplanted by thematic signposting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story contains surface-level thematic cohesion but lacks narrative urgency; elements included as checklist items rather than organic components; brevity exposes underdeveloped emotional foundations.</comment>
