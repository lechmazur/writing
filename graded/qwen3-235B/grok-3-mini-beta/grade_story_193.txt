<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear but under-explored; his transformation feels abrupt without deeper psychological nuance, though interactions with the mortar and pestle reveal his vulnerability and longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Key-turning beginning and potion-crafting ending create circularity, but pacing compresses emotional development; cause-effect between storm-induced encounter and healing lacks gradual buildup needed for full conviction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Frost-laden customs office creates atmospheric isolation matching the prince's psyche, with sensory details like howling wind and mortar textures, though the setting's symbolic connection to border-crossing/exile remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("tapestry of connection") and theme of healing through human connection elevate the narrative, though the redemption arc leans on familiar literary tropes rather than subverting them with unexpected complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around loneliness-as-disease metaphor, with compact structure leveraging symbolic objects effectively despite rushed emotional progression; the ending's reflective tone offers thematic closure without sentimentality.</comment>
