<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but overly abstract; the connection between Lira's shame and her actions lacks psychological depth. The brass bell's symbolic role is hinted at but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters in the DNA method's arbitrary logic; the transition from code to life feels unearned. Pacing balances key moments but rushes the entity's resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visually vivid but derivative, relying on cyberpunk tropes without innovation. Sensory details create ambiance but lack specificity to deepen emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates mood, but emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("quiet fire," "graceful intensity"). Theme of liberation is clear but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on neon-drenched cyberpunk imagery without subversion. Some phrases ("digital ether") feel contrived; the ending's symbolic ambition outpaces earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story structure holds together but feels like an assemblage of assigned elements rather than organic cohesion. Certain plot mechanics (DNA animation) strain suspension of disbelief.</comment>
