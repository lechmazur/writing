<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is poetically stated but lacks psychological depth. Assigned attribute "superficially profound" is reflected in his self-interrogation, but character lacks concrete behaviors or unique voice beyond thematic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks traditional cause-effect chain; spider-web method is symbolic but not practically executed. Connection between beginning/end exists thematically, but pacing feels artificially compressed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid setting creates vivid, original atmosphere through sensory-rich descriptions (gilded spires, paint-splattered lens). However, setting functions more as aesthetic backdrop than active force shaping the plot or character's decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric cohesion (dawn/spider webs/starlight) elevates the narrative. Story successfully evokes melancholic philosophical reflection, though emotional impact is diluted by overly abstract character portrayal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Excessive ornate imagery borders on purple prose ("winding road etched like scars"). Some fresh metaphors (laugh as "sharp echo of superficial profundity") but repetitive cosmic abstractions. Lacks human nuance in character psychology despite thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated into poetic framework but lack visceral narrative propulsion. Style supports thematic depth at the expense of emotional immediacy. Brief length highlights conceptual strengths but exposes character and plot thinness.</comment>
