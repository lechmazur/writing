<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mix of evocative details and clich√©s ("sound of resolve"); feels like pastiche of fantasy/sci-fi tropes with inconsistent tonal control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently woven; retro-futurist concept intriguing but lacks narrative urgency to elevate cohesion.</comment>
