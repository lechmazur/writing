<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak internal logic; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. Elara's transformation lacks psychological coherence despite vivid external symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Murals drive progression but structural transitions feel synthetic. The abrupt awakening to magnetic forces strains rather than strengthens causality within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elegant sensory layering compromised by over-reliance on "regret"/"hunger" as lazy atmospheric shorthand. Magnetic mountain's influence remains decorative rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric scaffolding (spoon/murals) but undercut by excessive exposition. The concept of chaos-as-inheritance carries intellectual weight yet suffers from moral ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts heirloom/murder trope clich√©s with paradox of monumentality embedded in triviality. Purple prose tendencies mar otherwise inventive sensory economy, particularly in mural descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story's architecture impresses formally but thematic gravity feels imposed rather than emergent. Lingering emotional resonance undermined by conceptual scaffolding overshadowing character.</comment>
