<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits (prudence, cheerfulness) are consistent but lack psychological depth; motivation to trace ancestry is clear but simplistic, driving action without emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc (quest → revelation → resolution) within constraints; pacing is uneven—climax feels abrupt despite tight structure, logical gaps in decoding process.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting blends Minoan motifs with modernity but lacks tactile specificity; atmosphere relies on vague allusions rather than vivid sensory immersion to ground the "familiar unknown."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of legacy and identity resonate; symbolism (knots, constellations) adds subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy exposition; ending resolves plot but not deeper tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on archetypal motifs (mystical ancestry, decoded letters); metaphors are occasionally fresh but undermined by florid, AI-typical overdescription.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interdependence; some components (e.g., Minoan setting) feel decorative rather than integral, weakening narrative synergy.</comment>
