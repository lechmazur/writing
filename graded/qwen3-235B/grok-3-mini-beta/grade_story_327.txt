<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's restlessness drives action but lacks nuanced internal conflict; motivation is clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot propelled by external forces (landslide) and negotiation climax; pacing tight but some transitions (e.g., sudden reflection vanishing) feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in underwater setting; "layered tranquility" tone is evoked but inconsistently maintained during spiritual negotiation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "complexly simple") and theme of transformation through imperfection resonate; ending feels resolved yet repetitive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some overused phrases ("turbulent undercurrents") and predictable tropes (teacher's legacy quest), but unique setting and the index card's conceptual role show ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel overstuffed; concise yet occasionally forced integration of assigned components weakens overall cohesion.</comment>
