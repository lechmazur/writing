<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth in explaining how his monkhood informs his obsession; transformation feels rushed despite thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc (obsession → breakthrough → inspiration) but struggles to balance pacing and emotional weight within brevity; resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly imagined (storms, cryptic symbols) but fails to convincingly merge "storm chasing" with monk’s scholarly quest; setting feels thematically dissonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses poetic devices effectively (e.g., "timidly loud voice"), but themes are stated more than dramatized; emotional resonance is diffuse despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by clichéd tropes (lone scholar’s breakthrough) and occasionally overwritten prose; some phrases ("timidly loud") feel forced rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually ambitious but uneven in execution; elements like "storm chasing" and "buttons" strain cohesion, though thematic ambition is evident.</comment>
