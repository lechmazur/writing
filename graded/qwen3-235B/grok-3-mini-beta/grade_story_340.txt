<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels rushed during her transformation of the spirit; cause-and-effect is logical but underexplored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by trope-laden descriptions (“twisted vines,” “unseen spirits”); youthify mechanic is fresh but undermined by predictable character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but feel utilitarian; the story’s brevity sacrifices depth, and the ending’s philosophical shift feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
