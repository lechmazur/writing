<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is primarily defined by abstract descriptors rather than concrete actions; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through meaningful choices. Rebellious past lacks tangible connection to present emotional release.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic progression but relies on convenient revelations (letter beneath sundial) rather than organic causality. Resolution feels imposed rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and atmospheric, though some descriptions border on cliché (ivy-covered decay as shorthand for melancholy). Sensory immersion effectively reinforces theme of abandonment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyric prose offers occasional arresting imagery (e.g., "shapes dissolved into dust") but occasionally veers into vagueness. Emotional arc remains surface-level despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Relies on well-worn motifs (cryptic puzzles, forgotten letters) without subversion. Metaphors (time as something to "undo") lack specificity. Prose occasionally lapses into decorative excess without deeper thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively within the narrative but lack transformative originality. The story’s brevity works for its introspective tone but sacrifices depth in character and thematic complexity.</comment>
