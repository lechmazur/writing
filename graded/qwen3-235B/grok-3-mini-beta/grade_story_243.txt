<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elowen's "jumpy" nature is repeatedly stated but not deeply internalized; his motivation lacks psychological nuance despite clear plot function. Actions align with external goals but lack emotional dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a revenge structure but feels rushed in its transitions. Climactic confrontation resolves logically but sacrifices emotional payoff; cause-effect for key reveals feels cursorily explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies heavily on visual pixelated/god motifs but offers sparse tactile/aural details. Some evocative imagery ("blocky landscapes flickered") diluted by repetitive descriptions of "glowing" and "echoing."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (fishhook, mural) creates thematic depth about truth-seeking. While conceptually engaging, emotional stakes remain theoretical rather than viscerally conveyed through concrete character moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concepts (e.g., "digital static," "corrupted code") feel inventively gaming-specific but occasionally rely on trope substitutions ("haunting echo from gods' dreams"). Overuse of "bizarre" and similar adjectives verges on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesive surface-level story with compelling iconography, but lacks thematic resonance beyond the metaphorical. The brevity compresses emotional arcs into exposition rather than earned progression; potential lingers unreached.</comment>
