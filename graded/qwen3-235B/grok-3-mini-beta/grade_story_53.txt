<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's rashness is stated but underdemonstrated; motivation shifts abruptly from protectiveness to cosmic contemplation without sufficient internal logic; traits and actions rarely intersect meaningfully</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plotted moments exist but lack causal cohesion; "moving day" framing is loosely attached to epiphany; cosmic awareness resolution feels tacked on rather than earned through structured progression</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered but occasionally overwrought; setting details (winds, caverns) effectively mirror internal states, though risk becoming sensory overload rather than narrative sustenance</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts poetic transcendence but relies heavily on stated emotions over subtext; celestial metaphors are serviceable rather than striking; thematic arc about protection/cosmic harmony is vague and underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Florid prose with machine-generated cadence; cosmic clich√©s, abstract adjectives, and repetitive sentence structures undermine originality; emotional beats are generic and declarative rather than experiential</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Failed synthesis of assigned elements into cohesive artistic vision; conceptual skeleton remains visible beneath overwritten surface; thematic pretensions never coalesce into resonant whole</comment>
