<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character’s doubted faith is present but remains superficial; missionary background lacks narrative integration, internal conflict hinted but underdeveloped. Actions align with skepticism but lack depth beyond thematic surface. No distinct “voice” in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; method (decoding piano echoes) drives the action but feels abstract and unmoored from cause-effect logic. Beginning and end share symbolic gestures but lack emotional or narrative cohesion. Pacing uneven within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Desert setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (heat, glass reflections), atmosphere haunting yet poetic. Connection between glass terrain and piano echoes is clever but underexplored; tone and world occasionally clash with narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (butterfly, piano) adds thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending offers closure but lacks narrative force. Literary devices (recurring motifs) are effective yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., “capriciously consistent” patterns), but surreal elements risk feeling formulaic. Avoids predictable tropes but occasionally resorts to ornate prose. Subtext about doubt/faith is nuanced but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story weaves assigned elements cohesively but inconsistently; some details (piano method, butterfly migration) feel tacked on. Style leans poetic but sacrifices clarity. Leaves lingering conceptual questions but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>
