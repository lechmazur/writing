<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weak interiority undermines motivation despite poetic gestures; actions don't fully organically emerge from a concrete psychological foundation. Traits remain symbolic abstractions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints but relies too heavily on metaphorical rather than dramatic progression; thematic resolution feels imposed rather than earned through concrete action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory texture creates mood but physical logic of setting remains underexploited; plant reactions feel decorative rather than narratively integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally overwhelm thematic subtlety; emotional resonance hindered by over-reliance on abstract phrasing rather than embodied metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery amidst occasional purple prose; metaphors demonstrate conceptual strength but occasionally prioritize lyrical quality over psychological precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack visceral urgency; brevity both strength and limitation; thematic ambition outpaces character embodiment.</comment>
