<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation aligns with actions, but internal transformation feels rushed and underexplored. Shyness and "unstoppable" drive lack nuanced interplay.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure works, but pacing uneven—dream sequences vivid yet compressed. Plot hinges on warping, but cause/effect logic occasionally ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory specifics (rust, fog, bioluminescence) immerse readers, but inconsistent tone balance between decay and dreamlike beauty weakens atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "fierce repose" and thematic resonance about finding beauty are memorable, but emotional depth often told rather than shown through concrete character choice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasional ornate phrasing ("spectral performers") and abrupt thematic shifts suggest underdeveloped human complexity beneath poetic surfaces.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements are functional but unevenly weighted; the carnival ship's decay and "unstoppable" theme stand out while film clubs and repose tone feel tacked on.</comment>
