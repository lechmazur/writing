<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on poetic descriptors but lacks psychological depth; motivation to "master an ancient art" feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Reactions to objects like the bead remain symbolic rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single repetitive action (tracking mirror distortions) without sufficient dramatic progression. Virtual calls function more as thematic tableaux than structurally consequential scenes. Resolution feels abrupt, telegraphed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively rendered through sensory details (warped glass, warming bead) but setting functions primarily as Gothic wallpaper rather than influencing character decisions or thematic development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elicits eerie unease through persistent metaphors, but emotional impact undermined by over-reliance on abstract concepts. Ending attempts profundity but reads as contrived rather than organically emerging. Lacks tension beneath the poetic surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Drenched in literary clich√©s ("screaming silence," "price of war") and self-consciously "poetic" phrasing. Metaphors accumulate without distinct purpose; repetitive descriptions of clumsiness/glass distortions suggest formulaic embellishment rather than authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements superficially coexist but rarely synergize. While conceptually ambitious, execution prioritizes mood over narrative substance. Limited emotional resonance despite elaborate aesthetic scaffolding; feels like style scaffolding plot rather than vice versa.</comment>
