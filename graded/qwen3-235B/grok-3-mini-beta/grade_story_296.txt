<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of distinct character voice or internal conflict; motivation stated but not organically demonstrated through layered choices. Detachment and spiritual mapping remain abstract rather than viscerally experienced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented progression from ritual initiation to spiritual revelation; abrupt transitions between atmospheric description and plot mechanics weaken narrative cohesion within the compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in submarine claustrophobia effectively contrasts mystical elements, but the "fluorescent buzz dying off" timeframe serves more as stylistic device than functional temporal anchor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (asymmetrical chopsticks mirroring facility imbalances) and layered theme of chaos-as-sanctuary elevate the narrative; resolution feels conceptually satisfying despite emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally sacrifices plausibility for poetic abstraction (e.g., cookbook annotations); some ornate phrasing strains toward profundity rather than earning it organically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; assigned elements function narratively but uneven interplay between mystical mechanics and emotional resonance undermines total immersion.</comment>
