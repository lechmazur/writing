<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character defined by excessive exposition; "skillfully incompetent" lacks behavioral proof. Motivation stated but insufficiently demonstrated through conflict-driven action. Internal change feels abrupt, relies on conceptual metaphors over lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed beyond cohesion; sculptor's chisel introduces arbitrary causality. Forgotten dreams device creates disjointed shifts rather than organic progression. Resolution appears imposed rather than earned through plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Descriptive textures compensate for underdeveloped spatial logic. Clockwork attic creates vivid but superficial atmosphere; mechanical elements fail to symbolically mirror character journey. Sensory details accumulate without thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("map of scars," "abduction") generate intellectual resonance but lack visceral impact. Transformation conclusion feels predetermined rather than discovered through narrative mechanics. Conceptually ambitious but execution leans on abstract declarations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overreliance on ornamental phrasing ("twisted artistry," "polished facade") risks aestheticization over authenticity. Tropes of self-deception and rebirth receive minimal subversion. Emotional states often summarized rather than embodied through concrete action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic signposts rather than organic components. Tight composition sacrificed for atmospheric density. Final revelation feels conceptually significant but narratively underpowered; transformation lacks tangible consequences.</comment>
