<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Underdeveloped internal conflict; motivation hinted but largely unexplored beyond surface-level poetic declarations. Character's desert past feels arbitrarily grafted onto space setting without meaningful psychological throughline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Circular structure relies on symbolic motifs rather than dramatic progression; resolution feels preordained and emotionally distant. Pacing uneven – rapid shifts between abstract concepts lack narrative ballast.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vividly rendered celestial imagery contrasts effectively with desert nostalgia. Sensory details (humming engines, brass vibrations) grounded but occasionally overloaded with metaphorical weight that distracts from immersive worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors about preservation vs transience create thematic resonance. Emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on paradoxical phrasing ("authentically artificial") that draws attention to style over substance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Excessive use of oxymoronic phrases and cyclical symbolism borders on algorithmic pattern-matching. Sensory descriptions occasionally veer into preciousness but show flashes of originality in merging technical (brass ruler) with mythical (orchard prophecy).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly synthesized – space pirate context underutilized. Conceptual density overwhelms narrative economy; length works against emotional engagement despite thematic ambition.</comment>
