<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits are assigned but not fully embodied; inner conflict is conceptually present but lacks nuanced emotional realism, relying heavily on abstract descriptors rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on ritualistic singing as a method, which drives the story forward logically but feels slightly forced in execution; the word limit restricts full exploration of cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sensory details like jasmine and bamboo create atmosphere, but these elements border on cliché; the calligraphy master’s courtyard functions as a symbolic setting but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like the tapestry-as-potential metaphor enrich the narrative, but emotional resonance is undercut by didactic explanations rather than showing through subtle action or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (e.g., arrogant warrior’s redemption arc); prose verges on purple with excessive ornate descriptions; the wedding song method introduces freshness but feels semi-contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere loosely through shared symbolism but lack organic integration; the story’s brevity sacrifices deeper thematic exploration, though it leaves a reflective aftertaste.</comment>
