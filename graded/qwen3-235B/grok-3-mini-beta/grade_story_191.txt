<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through action. The "sober cardsharp" trait has minimal influence on decisions or personality. Actions feel disconnected from established attributes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot structure undermined by fragmented progression. Time constraints create abrupt shifts rather than coherent arc. Pacing oscillates between stagnant and rushed without clear cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere offers surface-level texture but fails to integrate with narrative. Mist and silence remain decorative rather than shaping character motivations or plot progression through sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery occasionally resonates but overreliance on abstract metaphors dilutes impact. Thematic potential exists in dream-ink connections but lacks consistent development or subtextual depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Predictable gothic tropes masked by overwritten prose. Phrases like "ink swirling like dreams" feel generic. Emotional notes are stated rather than earned through nuanced character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially incorporated rather than organically integrated. Length amplifies disjointedness rather than creating deliberate brevity. Lingering impressions are atmospheric but narratively hollow.</comment>
