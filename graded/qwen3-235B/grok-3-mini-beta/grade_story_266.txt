<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's abstract symbolism overshadows tangible motivation; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth beyond the metaphor. Voice exists mainly through poetic devices rather than distinct personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear ritual structure works within constraints but lacks narrative tension beyond conceptual struggle; cyclical ending feels inevitable rather than earned through plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arctic-dawn setting vividly supports thematic weight through cold, transient imagery; sensory details like spinning clock hand and aurora clash beautifully with yoga studio surrealism.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong conceptual originality with floating studio and poetic deconstruction, but occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing ("jagged generosity" repetition); emotional nuance gets lost in elaborate descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive surreal tapestry but often serve poetic conceits over narrative urgency; leaves intellectual impression rather than visceral impact typical of top-tier publication.</comment>
