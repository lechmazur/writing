<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; shallow philosophy evolving into empathy feels contrived rather than earned through action. Internal consistency maintained but lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by compressed arc; transition from ambition to compassion relies too heavily on symbolic objects without sufficient dramatic progression. Pacing manages compact structure but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through sensory details like holographic stars and exotic blooms, but extraterrestrial setting remains decorative rather than thematically integrated. Timeframe adds urgency but isn't meaningfully exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uses layered metaphors effectively (washcloth as empathy's erosion, jewelry as inherited wisdom) but emotional impact undermined by declarative statements rather than subtle showing. Central theme emerges clearly but lacks surprising depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Exhibits AI-writing tics: cyclical phrasing about "layers," formulaic transitions between metaphor and reality, and predictable emotional beats. Tropes like heirloom-activated epiphany lack subversive ingenuity despite polished surface prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but without transcendent synergy; assigned constraints shape narrative effectively but fail to create resonant novelty. Conceptual framework holds together but doesn't push creative boundaries.</comment>
