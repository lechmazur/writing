<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character's motivation (dismantling fear idol) and connection to the veil are conceptually linked but lack psychological depth; reactions to abstract moral dilemmas feel narratively imposed rather than organically demonstrated through specific actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (contemplation → preparation → action → consequence) but key transitions (e.g., sudden idol-toppling) feel compressed; snowflake-pattern strategy lacks full logical integration with the action's execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory cohesion: crystalline imagery, sterile cold, and ethereal snow harmonize with post-emotional desolation; setting functions as active character through its atmospheric dominance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (veil as unresolved past, fractals as hope) elevates thematic impact, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized; ending's ambiguity weakens cathartic payoff despite strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original concept (rationality combating fear through organic patterns) subverts post-apocalyptic tropes, but occasionally bogs down in self-consciously poetic language; snowflake methodology risks feeling like artificial motif rather than narrative necessity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through atmospheric unity despite tight word constraints; emotional impact would benefit from more concrete character grounding and clearer distinction between philosophical inquiry and narrative momentum.</comment>
