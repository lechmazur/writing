<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's shyness is stated but undercut by her decisive actions; her "passionate disinterest" and motivation lack psychological nuance, feeling more like abstract concepts than lived traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics (social media revealing ancestral truth in an underwater city) strain credibility; convergence feels abrupt, with cause-effect relationships hastily sketched to meet word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bioluminescent corals and rusted stalls create vivid atmosphere; setting enhances the melancholic tone but underutilizes the underwater element's potential for tactile immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.3</question><comment>Verdant descriptors ("confusingly clear glow") verge on purple prose; social media integration in an underwater ruin feels anachronistically artificial without deeper worldbuilding justification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ideas resonate more than execution; the cosmic scale undermines character intimacy, and the ending's "lingering whisper" feels more like narrative evasion than thematic closure.</comment>
