<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character has defined traits (melancholy, desire to restore rituals), but lacks depth beyond these descriptors. Motivation is clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has arc (isolation to attempted unity) but feels condensed. Pacing adequate but lacks escalation. Cause-effect connections exist, resolution abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting vivid but underutilized. Atmospheric details like steam, creaking, and paint enhance mood but donâ€™t drive narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attempts metaphorical depth (geometry as bridge, crooked hope) but remains surface-level. Ending lacks resonance. Subtext implied but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Some originality in tea leaf analysis as plot device, but tone shifts (e.g., "crooked hope") feel imposed. Sensory details generic at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements used but not deeply integrated. Setting and metaphor stand out, but cohesiveness weakens. Thematic weight unevenly distributed.</comment>
