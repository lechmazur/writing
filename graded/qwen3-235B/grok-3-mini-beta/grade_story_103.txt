<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character depth sufficient but lacks layered internal conflict; motivation clear yet development feels surface-level, "grudgingly sweet" trait inconsistently embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with cause-effect relationships intact, but pivotal item-discovery-to-decision pacing feels slightly rushed despite coherent arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly oppressive—storm, mirrored distortion, and cold stone—evoke isolation effectively; setting tightly entwines with theme but lacks richer sensory contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Skillful use of symbols (constellation pattern, fractured reflection) and subtext on suffering's beauty; emotional resonance diluted by occasional sentimentality and overt thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by twisting redemption tropes; metaphor freshness (knocker's roar, wilted flower's decay) elevates originality despite minimal instances of slightly ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements synergize cohesively, particularly through symbolic item usage; brief length enhances tension yet risks underdeveloped emotional payoff; ending lingers with poignant ambiguity.</comment>
