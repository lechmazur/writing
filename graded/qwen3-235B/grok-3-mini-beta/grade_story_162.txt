<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (redemption, trust) are present but lack deeper exploration of how Jack's history as a gambler actively informs present decisions beyond abstract "carefree vs. diligent" contrasts. Backstory dominates over behavioral specifics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Non-linear structure through fragmented memories creates thematic resonance but disrupts cause-effect pacing within word constraints. The resolution feels abrupt rather than earned, with blueprint's technological stakes glossed over despite centrality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Workshop atmosphere has vivid sensory textures but inconsistent integration with plot - unwatched videotapes mentioned as ambiance yet never thematically connected to "hidden knowledge." Island memories lack distinct contrasts between tropical danger vs. current environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose creates emotional texture through metaphor ("tide waves" of memory), but surface-level theme of "chaos/harmony" lacks subtextual complexity. Ending's "peace" feels imposed rather than organically derived from character actions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar "redemption through shared trauma" trope without fresh subversion. Overuse of "beat" and "whisper" metaphors strains credibility. Some AI-like pattern repetition in descriptions of workshop ("hush/clinking/whirring") feels formulaic rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements combine into competent pulp-noir but lack transcendent cohesion. Workshop and blueprint integration shows ingenuity, but Elena's characterization remains secondary to Jack's arc. Lingering questions about tech implications feel unexplored.</comment>
