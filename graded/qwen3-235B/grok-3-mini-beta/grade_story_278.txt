<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's brooding nature and motivation to escape are established but lack depth in how servitude shaped him; glasses as a link to grandfather add dimension but feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is clear but rushed; escape via dust dance lacks concrete logic, causing abrupt shifts. The beginning-to-end arc exists but feels compressed, weakening tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting’s haze and sunbeam imagery create immersive atmosphere. Dust’s symbolic connection to rebellion is evocative, though the base’s scientific purpose feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of art as rebellion. Subtext about exploitation is clear, but emotional impact is diluted by abrupt character reactions and overreliance on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasionally slips into ornate prose (“murky tenderness”) and predictable tropes (lonely rebel escapes via mystical means). The glasses and grandfather’s backstory hint at originality but aren’t fully subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work together but with uneven cohesion; the base’s anomalies and escape method feel underintegrated. The ending lingers but sacrifices narrative clarity for poetic flourish.</comment>
