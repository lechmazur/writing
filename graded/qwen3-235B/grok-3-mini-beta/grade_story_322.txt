<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character development is philosophically layered but occasionally inconsistent; cynicism-to-enlightenment arc feels abrupt and undermotivated despite distinct, sarcastic voice enriching internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure hinges on pendular rhythm and vanishing water, but cause-effect logic falters under scrutiny; cyclical motif reinforces theme yet pacing feels artificially compressed within word limit.</comment>
