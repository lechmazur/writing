<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking recipes to restore fortune) is clear but lacks psychological depth beyond surface-level internal conflict; actions (walking, using illustration) align with assigned traits but fail to evolve into a fully realized personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant circular structure (entering park/leaving at dawn) anchors the plot, but the rapid descent into supernatural resolution feels rushed; cause-effect logic between harmonization ritual and roller coaster activation contains gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with decaying roller coaster's "skeletal" presence and "blurry vividness" enhancing eerie atmosphere; underutilizes tactile/smell details (e.g., rust tang, floral decay from plants) for deeper sensory anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (legacy as "weight," botanical illustration as memory map) deepen thematic resonance; final choice to abandon recipes carries poignant subtext about inherited trauma; emotional restraint in narration amplifies impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt cliche through eerie fusion of science (botanical precision) and supernatural; pacing occasionally reveals AI-generated tendencies in abrupt tonal shifts (e.g., coaster "grinding to life" lacks build-up); language balances poeticism without excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements serve story but require suspension of disbelief due to tight clustering; the brief format amplifies rather than limits thematic potency through compressed symbolism; lingering question about legacy's universal cost lingers post-reading.</comment>
