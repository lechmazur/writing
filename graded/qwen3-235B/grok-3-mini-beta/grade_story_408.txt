<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character blends conflicting traits, but motivations feel underexplored—internal war lacks visceral depth, reducing moral complexity to surface contrasts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; abrupt shifts between exposition and action undercut tension, while the ending’s "ensnaring" resolution feels contrived despite thematic foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually evocative but inconsistently woven; storms and orchard imagery often feel decorative rather than integral to character or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Literary devices (nail as symbol) are effective, but themes of control/complicity lack cohesion—emotional resonance is muted by overly abstract introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but stretches credibility—coy malevolence borders on caricature, and some prose ("vengeful spirits") dips into artificial lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don’t fully intertwine; the "tradition" and "craft fairs" feel appended rather than foundational, diluting the story’s ideological weight.</comment>
