<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Landlord's traits remain abstractly symbolic; dialogue and actions lack emotional depth or psychological complexity despite consistent thematic alignment with adaptation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean arc disrupted by rushed transitions; parade's role as catalyst introduced swiftly but underdeveloped, while resolution ties to theme without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting/timeframe mismatch: "design studio" and "before recorded experience" contradict; atmospheric descriptions overwhelm with vague abstraction rather than purposeful immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion and symbolic resonance (bee pin, detours) deepen narrative; poetic language and paradoxical framing ("cryptically obvious") elevate intellectual impact despite abstract delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Avoids AI formula through paradoxical imagery and dense metaphor, but repetitive phrasing ("manic clarity") and occasionally overwritten abstraction teeters on edge of purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thematic unity falters under structural tension; some elements (bee pin, adaptation) bind tightly while others (timeframe, studio) feel arbitrary, leaving mixed cohesion.</comment>
