<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elaron's solemnity is present but underutilized; "mild fervor" is repeatedly stated rather than organically shown through nuanced actions, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The poem-driven quest creates a clear arc, but pacing stumbles in the middle as passages blend; some cause-effect relationships (e.g., gear malfunctions) feel contrived for convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich descriptions of the clock tower and luminescent garden succeed, but the shifting sands’ urgency lacks tangible stakes, diluting the atmospheric threat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole but lack alchemy—some (sands, sword) feel peripheral; the ending lingers thematically but struggles to fully transcend its structure as a quest puzzle-box.</comment>
