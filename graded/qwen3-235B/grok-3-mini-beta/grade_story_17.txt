<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but psychological depth remains surface-level; the guilt is thematically present but lacks visceral emotional anchoring through concrete behaviors or memories that would make the remorse feel earned or deeply immersive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent but compressed; the beginning/introductory imagery competes with the climax for attention, leaving the resolution feeling rushed and insufficiently earnedâ€”emotional payoff struggles against the word limit's constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details (flickering candles, ink swirls) and thematic setting contrasts, though the witch's chamber leans on genre tropes rather than innovating within them, slightly diluting its impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong through subtextual metaphors (eulogies as mirrors) and symbolic objects, though the ending's hopeful note feels abrupt; the theme of redemption through truth is well-earned but unevenly paced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Linguistically inventive and atmospheric, but contains occasional purple prose ("brazen modesty") and overly ornate phrasing; some character introspection feels generalized rather than psychologically specific, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive and conceptually rich despite tight constraints; elements are purposefully integrated to serve theme and character, though the brevity occasionally sacrifices emotional density in the resolution phase.</comment>
