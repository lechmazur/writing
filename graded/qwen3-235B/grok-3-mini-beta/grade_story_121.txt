<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's shifty nature is mentioned but inconsistently applied; motivation to "unify conflicting hearts" is abstract and occasionally tenuous despite emotional payoff in father-daughter reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Parole hearing framing and drive-in setting create circular structure, but plot momentum relies on under-explained leaps between caravan pursuits and mineralization ritual; pacing occasionally rushed within tight limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eerie, overgrown drive-in atmosphere masterfully mirrors internal turmoil; caravans evoke dreamlike transience. Sensory details like brass microscope gleam and iridescent dust enhance mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transformative symbolism (crystallized failures) powerfully executes "right to fail" theme; subtext of imperfection as connective tissue is sophisticated. Ending balances hope without saccharine resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids genre tropes; metaphors (mineralization as redemption) are fresh. Occasional adverbial redundancy ("anguished joy" repeated) slightly undermines otherwise purposeful prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly emphasize assigned components (parole timeframe underutilized). Epiphany-driven brevity feels intentional, leaving resonant questions about failure's redemptive value.</comment>
