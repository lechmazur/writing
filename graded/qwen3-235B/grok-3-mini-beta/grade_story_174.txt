<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (redemption) is clear but under-developed; actions align with traits, but internal conflict lacks visceral depth. Voice remains overly poetic rather than distinct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc but pacing feels uneven. Frost-to-fireworks logic requires interpretive leaps; cause-effect relationships blurred by abstract imagery that occasionally hinders narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting creates rich atmosphere through sensory details (mist, frost textures), but the car-in-waterfall library strains plausibility. Worldbuilding privileges metaphor over coherence in moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphor density creates beauty but risks overwrought symbolism. Theme of redemption through nature harmonizes with setting, yet emotional resonance diluted by generalized "epiphany" clich√©s.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally relies on atmospheric abstraction as substitute for concrete storytelling. Frost pattern revelation feels slightly contrived, bordering on AI-generated epiphany patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain narrative logic (car in library). Brief length works for lyrical moments but sacrifices deeper character exploration.</comment>
