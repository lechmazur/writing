<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character development leans too heavily on abstract symbolism at the expense of psychological realism; the sheriff's motivations are poetically described but lack tangible emotional grounding or complex inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure feels fragmented despite the word count; rebellion against despair progresses through poetic leaps rather than coherent cause-effect sequences, weakening dramatic impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Surreal atmosphere is aesthetically striking but inconsistently textured; sensory immersion relies disproportionately on conceptual descriptors rather than grounded environmental details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphorical resonance and cosmic symbolism; undercut by overreliance on abstract concepts over embodied narrative progression, limiting emotional penetration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into self-consciously "literary" phrasing; metaphors feel freshly juxtaposed but risk becoming a closed loop of poetic self-reference.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Structural coherence exists but feels meticulously calculated rather than organically earned; ambitious thematic synthesis compensates for thin character/textural engagement.</comment>
