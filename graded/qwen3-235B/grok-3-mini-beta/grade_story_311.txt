<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her "serene anger" lacks nuanced manifestation beyond surface declarations, and her "tense" quality isn't deeply integrated into her behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a clear arc but feels slightly rushed; the transition from discovery to rebellion lacks layered buildup, though cause/effect connections between fragments and her resolve are logical within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lunar greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescent flora, artificial suns), enhancing atmosphere and thematic contrast with Elara's inner turmoil, though some descriptive elements verge on ornamental.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (photograph as inheritance) and subtext about autonomy exist, but emotional resonance is undercut by frequent exposition; the ending is thematically satisfying but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("serene anger," "serendipitously stubborn") and generic descriptors weaken originality; while the lunar rebellion trope is marginally subverted, the prose occasionally lapses into ornate, disconnected passages that feel algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but unevenlyâ€”some (fragments, photograph) are essential, others (park visits) underexploited; the brief format allows thematic concision but sacrifices emotional depth.</comment>
