<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s intellect and social awkwardness shape her actions, but her motivation feels occasionally asserted rather than deeply dramatized. The doll amplifies her vulnerabilities, but her “awakening” to her mission feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (installation → revelation → voyage), but pacing feels uneven. The doll’s map discovery is pivotal yet under-explained. The ending ties to the beginning thematically but lacks narrative complexity within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bioluminescent bay is vivid and atmospheric, enhancing the theme of transience. However, sensory details beyond visual descriptions (e.g., touch of waves, ambient sounds) are minimal, limiting full immersion. The futuristic setting feels decorative rather than integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Offers strong symbolism (doll, ephemeral art) and subtext (fragility as power). The ending evokes thematic resonance but leans heavily on exposition (“We are stronger in our breaks”) rather than nuanced character reflection. Emotional impact is undercut by occasional didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases (“awkward elegance” repeated) and predictable metaphors (“tiniest flaws spark brightest revolutions”) verge on cliché. Emotional beats are often stated rather than shown, and the plot follows a familiar arc of solitary genius discovering hidden truths. The concept of bioluminescent tech adds originality but isn’t fully exploited.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story weaves most elements cohesively, but some (fashionably timeless, enforcing) strain logic. The brevity challenges depth, yet the theme lingers. Combines speculative and literary tones unevenly but maintains a clear central idea.</comment>
