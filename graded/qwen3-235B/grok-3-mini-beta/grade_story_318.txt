<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric layers (e.g., lullabies as defiance) work, but emotional resonance suffers from occasional 'telling' over 'showing' despite strong symbolic undertones.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abstract concepts feel intentionally surreal, but some phrases verge on ornate generality, risking perception as formulaic or AI-generated despite flashes of innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack cohesive transcendence; the story feels deliberately crafted but occasionally constrained by its own abstraction.</comment>
