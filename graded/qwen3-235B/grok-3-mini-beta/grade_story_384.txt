<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains surface-level; franticness lacks grounding, motivation feels imposed rather than organically tied to role as cook or setting. No distinct voice or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot stumbles between concepts; key discoveries feel rushed, cause-effect lacks coherence within tight word limit. Abrupt shifts undercut narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere but doesn't deeply integrate with character or plot. Sensory details present but generic, missing layered connections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth-seeking resonate faintly, but emotional weight undermined by abstract prose. Ending lacks resolution or lingering impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on paradoxical phrases and predictable arcs (""frenzied tranquility,""coded discovery""). Lacks stylistic boldness and avoids risking deeper emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements assembled mechanically; narrative cohesion never fully achieved. Premise has potential but execution feels constrained by checklist-driven construction.</comment>
