<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (harmony with nature) is clear and consistent with actions; "ferociously polite" trait influences interactions but feels occasionally stylized rather than humanly nuanced. Masked intentions could have been explored more deeply to avoid feeling schematic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from coin toss to intervention with the wheel, but pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing the secret mission's stakes. Connection between beginning and end is coherent but lacks a minor emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive (scent of lavender, tactile wheel descriptions), though the flower-pressing workshop's symbolic connection to "intervening" in ecological destruction remains underdeveloped despite strong sensory grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (wheel as fate navigation, anguished joy) evoke layered meaning, but emotional resonance is undercut by overt "telling" ("anguished joy," "sorrow for the earth's wounds"). Subtler showing would enhance impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining ecological activism with floral preservation, though phrases like "whispered of joy born from pain" risk poetic clich√©. Tension between preservation/restoration adds nuance to avoid formulaism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere thematically, though the brevity constraints leave some (flower workshop's role in encoding maps) feeling conceptually bold but underexplored. Lingering thematic resonance compensates for minor structural thinness.</comment>
