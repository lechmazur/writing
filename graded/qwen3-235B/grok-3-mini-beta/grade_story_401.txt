<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's guiltily innocent nature is established but relies on vague "past accident" without emotional depth; motivation is clear but told through abstract metaphors ("storm-tossed sea") rather than tangible actions; decoding diaries connects to healing but feels narratively imposed rather than organically tied to wilderness guiding trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot pushes forward through decoding action but timeline feels compressed; connection between coffee ritual and artifact decoding lacks causal logic; ring's symbolic importance emerges abruptly; healing arc is present but resolution occurs too swiftly for emotional impact in limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pirate ballroom's waterlogged atmosphere is vividly rendered with strong sensory details (coral chandeliers, blanket texture); tone contrasts effectively between eerie decay and hopeful decoding; time constraint hinders deeper integration of ritual coffee steam with ghostly imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors of ocean depths as emotional mirrors work well; theme of healing through objects has resonance; ending feels premature with insufficient "showing" of forgiveness process; emotional navigation concept is promising but explained rather than demonstrated through Elias' actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overuse of storm/ocean metaphors and sentimental phrases ("equalize inner chaos"); decoding through crocheted diaries shows creativity but strains credibility; character psychology remains abstract rather than embodied; theme treads familiar emotional arcs without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates elements but often feels like checklist fulfillment; brevity hampers depth; emotional resolution doesn't fully earn itself; lingering impact relies more on concept than sustained narrative force; shows glimmers of thematic depth but remains half-realized.</comment>
