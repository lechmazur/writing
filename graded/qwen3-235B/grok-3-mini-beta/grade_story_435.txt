<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak integration of "professional dream interpreter" trait with actions; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced character reasoning; impersonation method inconsistently tied to core personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot forced by surreal elements rather than logical cause-effect; rushed climax undermines coherence; "rewrite laws" motivation drives structure but lacks believable mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create immersive atmosphere but disconnected from deeper plot functions; "baking" timeframe only superficially atmospheric.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise stifled by forced integration of repetitive phrases ("occasionally frequent"); tone shifts feel calculated rather than organic; some purple prose detracts from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition evident but compromised by disjointed element integration; brief length highlights structural gaps rather than intentional brevity; thematic impact diluted.</comment>
