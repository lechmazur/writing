<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Poor integration of "telekinetic dice" into motivation; planting trees feels forced; inconsistent connection between philosophically practical nature and actions; reactions to tapestry lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot struggles with pacing: rapid shifts from dice-rolling to tapestry decoding to raid alarms; unresolved tension between sacred ritual and incoming threat; weak cause-effect logic in deciphering methods.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mismatched sensory details: "hydroponic bay" contrasts with "flame" atmosphere; space pirate setting undermined by earthy agrarian metaphors; inconsistent sacred/disorder tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("chaotic prophecies", "dice whispering") but undercut by over-schematic theme statement; emotional impact diluted by didactic ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Derivative hybrids (space pirates+agricultural lore) lack subversion; "flame-awakened tapestry" and "sacred disorder" feel like checklist tropes; excessive adjectives ("cosmic dust") hinder clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Overstuffed with mandatory elements (7 distinct required components); tone oscillates between mysticism and hard-sci-fi; themes suggested rather than dramatized through conflict.</comment>
