<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elowen's stoicism and archivist motivation are clear but lack psychological depth; her emotional conflict about lying feels underexploited despite surface-level tension between preservation and deception.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concise arc exists (intervention during formula erasure) but relies on compressed cause-effect; the climactic pivot from observation to deception lacks gradual buildup within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative with sharp tactile details (glowing dust, splintered runes) but leans on clich√©d "haunted forest" imagery without subverting expectations about witchcraft settings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. distortion resonate through metaphor-rich scenes, but emotional impact is muted by over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("brash tenderness") rather than embodied struggle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but occasionally veers into purple prose ("twisted like living entities"); "trail of nightmares" and "whispering voids" feel tropish despite fresh core concepts like lies protecting truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but with mechanical efficiency; the ending satisfies conceptually but lacks lingering resonance from character stakes or worldbuilding implications.</comment>
