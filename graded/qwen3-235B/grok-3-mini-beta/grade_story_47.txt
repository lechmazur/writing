<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's dutiful nature and eagerness are present but lack psychological nuance; motivation to mock mortality feels imposed rather than organically connected to her late mentor's glove or the cryptic voice notes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmented structure of voice-note clues creates intrigue but undermines causality; auditions as framework provide scaffolding but transitions between reveals feel abrupt, diluting narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary and oppressive quiet establish palpable atmosphere, but sensory details remain narrowly visual/tactile; the setting enhances melancholic tone without fully interrogating its symbolic potential as a liminal space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "graceless beauty" and reframing concept show ambition, but emotional impact is dulled by over-reliance on lyrical abstraction over concrete character embodiment; ending feels thematically conclusive yet emotionally hollow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong subversion of "saboteur" trope through self-reflection twist, but prose occasionally slips into precious phrasing; metaphors remain striking yet occasionally generic (e.g., "tapestry of mysteries"), undermining originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but without transformative synergy; the tight word count amplifies thematic ambition while exposing underdeveloped emotional stakes; conceptually intriguing but lacks distinctive authorial voice to elevate beyond competent genre exercise.</comment>
