<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical depth outpaced psychological realismâ€”bard functions as thematic vessel rather than fully realized human. Motivation coheres with static internal struggle but lacks behavioral specificity grounded in lived detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structural symmetry of liberation arc constrained by word limit; transformation feels narratively compressed despite poetically linked beginning/middle/end. Conceptual throughline clear but payoff diminished by brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ambient sensory immersion in mushroom hall superbly establishes mood, but setting occasionally prioritizes poetic description over functional narrative integration with character's psychological journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism elevates theme of self-reclamation, yet relies excessively on tell-don't-show in conveying emotional shifts. Ending delivers quiet resonance but lacks narrative weight to anchor abstract triumph.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasional flourishes of overwrought prose ("glow of the interface, refracting the sounds into spectral images") dilute impact. Tropes of artistic doubt receive atmospheric novelty but insufficient conceptual reinvention to transcend formulaic arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Competent execution of thematic elements within constraints, but fails to transcend into transcendent literary work. Cohesion achieved through poetic repetition rather than narrative urgency or revelatory insight.</comment>
