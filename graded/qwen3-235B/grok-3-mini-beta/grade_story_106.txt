<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's "objectively biased" trait isn't consistently demonstrated in actions or voice; motivation to escape dead-end life is clear but doesn't fully integrate with the symbolic use of quilt/stamps to dismantle boundaries.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression feels underdeveloped; sudden shift from isolation to "borrowed valor" lacks psychological progression; cause-effect between quilt arranging and system override remains under-explained despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic decay imagery contrasts with abstract symbolism, but underwater setting's thematic relationship to "erased boundaries" remains underexplored; bioluminescence feels more decorative than narratively essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (quilt patches, algae pulsations) work effectively but remain surface-level; emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition rather than subtle character evolution; theme of "blurred lines" underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on familiar literary clich√©s (e.g., "flotsam" family, "tattered books") dilutes originality; some fresh concepts (postage stamp-quilt fusion) undermined by overly ornate descriptions and abrupt tonal shifts suggesting algorithmic patterning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Successful integration of most elements (stamps/quilt connection stands out), but strained cohesion between underwater setting and boundary-erasure concept; concise format feels limiting rather than purposeful despite memorable imagery.</comment>
