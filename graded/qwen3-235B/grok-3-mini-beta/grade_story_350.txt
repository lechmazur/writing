<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (truth-seeking) is clear but lacks depth beyond a single driving force; actions align with traits, but minimal emotional nuance or evolution beyond stated resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on contrived cause-effect (tears aligning with stamps); pacing feels rushed in places, weakening the resolution's emotional weight despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eerie temple atmosphere enhanced by sensory details (torchlight, marble whispers), but setting remains superficial; "alone intimacy" tone is inconsistent, fluctuating between introspection and melodrama.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (shadows, perfection vs. chaos) and thematic depth about truth’s duality, but overly reliant on flowery metaphors; ending feels emotionally manipulative rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive descriptors (“symphony,” “echo,” “swell”) verge on purple prose; emotional beats are stated rather than shown; stamp album and temple tropes lack inventive subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack seamless integration; short length amplifies disjointedness (e.g., wedding gown’s backstory unexplored); thematic tension is compelling but execution feels strained.</comment>
