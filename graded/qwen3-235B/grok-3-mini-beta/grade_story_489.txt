<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character remains elusive abstraction; motivations (aggressively kind, preservation) are stated not demonstrated. Actions lack specificity revealing personality; no distinct voice in narration. Constantly described as "brazen calm" without showing how this trait manifests meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Lacks coherent plot structure; arbitrary cause-effect between whale call, flinging whistle, and rescuing traditions. No clear beginning/middle/end; resolution feels disconnected from premise. Pacing is stagnant despite word constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse has atmospheric potential but relies on clich√© descriptors (fog, whispers, relics) rather than specific sensory details. Whale sounds add auditory element but aren't meaningfully integrated with setting. Overall mood remains generic and ornate rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Overly ornate prose substitutes for depth; "brazen calm" repeated ritualistically without thematic payoff. Heavy-handed symbolism (whistle=tradition bridge) lacks subtlety. Ends with trite message about legacy without earned emotional resonance or narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (haunted lighthouse guardian, mystical wisdom) combined with formulaic language. Repetitive metaphors ("undercurrent of wisdom") and abstract descriptors create mechanical rhythm. Excessive adjectives (spectral, primordial, dormant) favor style over substance. No distinctive authorial voice emerges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elements included but not well-integrated; feel like checklist items rather than organic components. Excessively stylized prose hinders clarity and emotional connection. Brief length exposed structural weaknesses rather than demonstrating narrative efficiency. Leaves no meaningful impression beyond superficial mysticism.</comment>
