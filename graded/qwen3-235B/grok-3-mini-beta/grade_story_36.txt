<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has clear traits and motivation but psychological nuance is lacking; internal consistency maintained but emotional depth remains surface-level</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks satisfying progression; action sequence compresses critical transitions, reducing emotional weight of the character's resurgence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in setting enhance mood, though some descriptions border on excessive; atmosphere strongly supports the tone of mechanized decay and personal reinvention</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor and symbolism (skateboard, gears), but thematic repetition overshadows subtext; ending lacks emotional resolution despite strong imagery</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Over-reliance on abstract adjectives ("placid ferocity") and clich√©d phrases ("call to arms"); some originality in combining steampunk with personal apocalypse, but uneven execution</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Basic cohesion achieved, but elements serve plot mechanics more than thematic resonance; writing shows potential but lacks polished integration of all components</comment>
