<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's naivety and gambling impulse drive actions, but depth is limited by brevity. Motivation is clear but transformation feels slightly rushed. Reactions to the candle mold hint at longing but lack layered introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Structure is mostly coherent with clear arc, but pacing feels compressed in mid-section. Storm surge resolution connects well to theme, though some plot transitions lack full emotional weight due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory details (salt air, candlelight) that complement melancholic tone. Setting's mechanical and natural elements clash meaningfully, though the professors' presence could be better integrated into the station's worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (tides as risk, candles as fleeting life) are evocative. Ending delivers emotional resonance through understated transformation. Subtext about unspoken human-nature negotiations is poignant, though some thematic threads feel slightly heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality exists in setting/imagery (e.g., tidal station, defiant candle), but the gambler's redemption arc follows familiar patterns. Some phrases lean toward purple prose ("whispering rusted gears"), and the professors border on caricature.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with minor seams showing. The candle mold and tides serve as strong thematic anchors. Feels purposefully concise, though the professors' role and evacuation aftermath could benefit from more nuanced treatment.</comment>
