<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt is consistent but lacks nuanced exploration of emotional evolution. Motivation drives action but inner conflict is more stated than deeply felt, preventing full complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Solid rising action through skirmish and pen revival; pacing feels slightly rushed during the ledger's role in restoration. Coherence maintained despite tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking sensory immersion with turbines' hum, iridescent nib visuals, and sacred spring luminosity. Atmospheric reverence for lost knowledge complements tone and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (pen as redemption vessel) and symbolism (turbines as eternal guardians) add resonance. Ending effectively mirrors the theme of bridging eras, though emotional beats could be subtler.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("resigned exuberance") and slightly forced transitions between action and thematic reflection. Avoids most AI clich√©s but occasionally favors precision over stylistic risk-taking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Cohesive but not groundbreaking integration of elements. The turbine temple setting feels more decorative than thematically essential, slightly diluting overall synergy.</comment>
