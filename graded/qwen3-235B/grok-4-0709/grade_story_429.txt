<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is poignant but lacks nuanced development; his actions align with his goal but his earthy roots don't deeply influence his methods or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but rushed; the mystical "folding" provides fantastical resolution without narrative buildup, weakening causal logic within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with vivid sensory details harmonizing with the tone, though the setting's connection to the farmer's identity feels superficial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in cosmic folding and alchemical elements, but formulaic "restoration of heritage" arc and overwrought phrases ("cosmic origami") temper authenticity.</comment>
