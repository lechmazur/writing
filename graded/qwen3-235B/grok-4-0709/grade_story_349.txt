<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thorne's cynically hopeful attitude is present but thinly developed; his decision to spread herbs aligns with his trait but lacks internal conflict evolution; interactions remain transactional rather than revealing deeper nuances of his stranded existence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from crash to herb-sharing to resolution, but the speed dating setup feels tangential; cause-effect between herb dissemination and orchard-saving is underdeveloped; pacing compresses emotional beats into declarative statements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "vine-choked walls" and "charred serenity" create evocative mood; the medieval-fantasy-techno blend is superficially rendered rather than thematically integrated; sensory immersion remains uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Herbs as metaphors for hope and the horizon light's imagery elevate the narrative; dialogue lacks subtext, yet the closing "rebellion against loss" carries thematic resonance; subtext about connection through shared impermanence lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting avoids genre clichés through specific details but stumbles with speed dating gimmick; herbs avoid typical "magic fix-alls" by requiring active dissemination; character logic leans on deterministic hopefulness without interrogating sincerity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere surface-level but strain under scrutiny—observatory's symbolism underexploited, herb magic remains unexplained, and tonal dissonance between post-apocalyptic tech and medieval melancholy persists.</comment>
