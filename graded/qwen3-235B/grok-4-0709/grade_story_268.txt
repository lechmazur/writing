<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptual but underdeveloped; vigilante's duality exists but lacks nuanced exploration beyond surface gestures; motivation clear but one-dimensional, with emotional erosion feeling telegraphed rather than organically portrayed through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but strain credibility; mirror distortion method feels awkwardly literalized without sufficient technical/psychological plausibility; virtual call resolution occurs abruptly, skipping key emotional and logical beats required for the stated stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Virtuosic atmosphere through tactile decay details (dust motes, rusted chair); screaming silence manifests effectively as physical pressure; waiting area's wartime abandonment and virtual calls create haunting dissonance between past trauma and present alienation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor of distorting reality via mirror, but thematic payoff undermined by heavy-handed declarations; emotional resonance diluted by melodramatic weeping ending; writing style's visceral descriptions elevate moments, yet over-reliance on conceptual abstractions weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Echoes of vigilante tropes and "ancient art" mysticism; some forced phrasing ("channeling energy," "eroding soul") veers toward formulaic; sensory details uneven (mirror distortions vivid, but vague "warmed bead" lacks physicality); subtext feels superficially applied rather than integrally constructed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Degree of success in blending elements is commendable under constraints; however, reliance on familiar vengeance structures and undercooked innovations prevent transcendence; final image holds poignant questions about cycle of revenge, but lacks revelatory force for "prestigious publication" standards.</comment>
