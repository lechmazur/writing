<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear, but inner conflict resolution could be more nuanced; the transformation from rage to non-violence feels somewhat abrupt despite coherent throughlines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses the word limit effectively for a complete arc, but pacing shifts between subway, attic, and parties feel slightly disjointed despite thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (subway flicker, attic rustles, clinking glasses) that deepen mood and theme, though haunted elements could resonate more consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and subtext elevate the theme of non-violent transformation; some emotional beats verge on tell-over-show but are mitigated by poetic craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s with fresh metaphors and a unique method of "elimination," but relies slightly on gothic tropes; language occasionally veers toward ornate description without full emotional integration.</comment>
