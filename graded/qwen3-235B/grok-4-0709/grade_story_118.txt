<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Agents remain abstract constructs shaped by assigned traits rather than developed personas; motivation (anchoring echoes) exists but lacks visceral emotional grounding or nuanced decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Non-linear progression through therapeutic ritual lacks conventional arcs but maintains conceptual momentum; pacing unevenâ€”dense atmosphere delays catharsis until abrupt dawn conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hyper-stylized setting with ozone vents, deceptive vending, and spy mannequins creates immersive, surreal environment where wax codifying regrets feels paradoxically plausible and hauntingly tactile.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual elegance of solidified regret-as-art fascinates thematically, but leans heavily on ornate description over emotional payoff; candle-coded tragedies suggest deeper meaning never fully unpacked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metallic precision dominates sensory detail (ozone, synthetic hums) but occasionally devolves into algorithmic flourishes ("whispered encrypted secrets"); metaphorical richness feels pre-engineered rather than organically discovered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Coherence emerges through persistent thematic repetition rather than narrative inevitability; some elements (espionage therapist hive-mind) showcase invention, while others (dawn "renewal") tread familiar catharsis arcs.</comment>
