<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (shifty, trad-spontaneity) remain surface descriptors; motivation to "unify hearts" lacks psychological specificity. Emotions stated more than dramatized through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot moves purposefully but lacks interior logic—how microscope enables mineralization? Pacing rushes resolution; surrealism undermines cause-effect, though symbolic arc from parole to crystallization exists.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid visual details (rusted poles, glowing wagons) create haunting mood, but atmosphere remains untethered from character psychology; minimal sensory texture beyond sight dilutes immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Potent symbols (mineralized failure = beauty) undercut by overwritten metaphors and self-consciously poetic phrasing; ending's emotional payoff feels strained rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on "warring hearts" trope and surrealist spectacle reads algorithmic—melodramatic descriptors ("angui-shed joy") repeat; lacks human-flawed nuance in emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High-concept density overwhelms narrative cohesion; elements function mechanically rather than organically. Conceptual ambition outpaces execution, though mineralization theme lingers ambiguously.</comment>
