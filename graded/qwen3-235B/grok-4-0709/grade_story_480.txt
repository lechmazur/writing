<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but lacks nuance; Elias's motivations feel surface-level despite the surreal premise. Reactions to objects (receipt, strangers) align with traits but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on minimalist progression rather than dramatic momentum; the infiltration sequence feels perfunctory. Logical progression exists but lacks textural depth to fully realize the arc in the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually vivid but atmospheric choices occasionally border on gothic affectation. Sensory details (e.g., "creaks and distant drips") immerse without fully interrogating the socio-political undercurrents the setting implies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "addictive scrolls" and ritual fire symbolism elevate the narrative, but emotional impact is diluted by prioritizing conceptual irony over character interiority. Ending resonates thematically but feels schematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Blends recognizable tropes (urban decay, digital detox) with genre-bending elements (exorcism) to generate modest originality. Some overused descriptors ("whispers of truth") and predictable atmospheric contrasts undercut uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but sacrifices emotional gravity for conceptual scaffolding. The brief form amplifies structural efficiency at the cost of thematic resonance; intellectual execution outpaces visceral impact.</comment>
