<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's sarcasm and panic create a distinct voice, but her motivations and transformation lack psychological depth. The connection between her environmental resolve and puzzle-box mechanic feels more symbolic than emotionally resonant, leaving her inner conflict underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on inventive cause-effect (puzzle-solving reveals solutions), but the compressed arc feels rushed. The transition from panic to purpose lacks narrative scaffolding, and the victory against "billboard barons" feels abrupt rather than earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Neon-lit desert and water rings provide strong visual foundation, but other sensory details (smells of scorched earth, tactile weight of the puzzle box) are underexploited. The setting's thematic potential (consumerism vs. sustainability) isn't fully exploited to contextualize character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like the puzzle box's "whispering secrets of sustainability" and water rings as climate prophecy elevate the narrative. The closing image of "the desert bloomed in defiance" creates lasting thematic resonance, though emotional beats occasionally rely too heavily on snark as shorthand for depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some phrasing ("eco-apocalypse bingo," "planet's punchline") risks cleverness over coherence. The pocket puzzle box and water-ring divination avoid clichés but the "solar panel in a blackout" simile feels formulaic. Balances ingenuity with occasional overwriting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mechanically competent but uneven. The puzzle box and desert setting contain rich conceptual chemistry that sometimes overpowers the human-scale stakes. High stylistic ambition outpaces execution — clever ideas exist but require tighter integration to transcend the "message fiction" impulse.</comment>
