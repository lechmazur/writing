<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's "no-nonsense" trait lacks grounding in specific actions—gruffness is stated but not vividly demonstrated. Empathy is implied through mollifying the spirit but remains surface-level. The blacksmith role is metaphorically rich but underexplored narratively; forging emotions is hinted at but never dissected beyond poetic description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from disturbance to resolution, but the 400-word framework strains coherence. The heartbeat synchronization feels abrupt, its mechanics left unexamined. Preserved traditions as a theme bookend the narrative but don’t organically drive the action’s stakes or emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted dollhouse museum delivers vivid, eerie imagery (miniature tea parties, spectral lace), but setting rarely transcends atmosphere. The uncanny details (e.g., "icy gales") enhance mood but rarely deepen character or theme. Sensory immersion is strong, but the setting’s symbolic potential remains underleveraged.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stained glass as a metaphor for fragmented humanity’s enduring essence resonates. The heartbeat syncing gesture is a memorable, tactile image. The ending lands thematically but lacks emotional weight due to underdeveloped stakes. Subtext about tradition’s durability is clear yet surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality in framing a blacksmith as a spectral emotional archivist is undermined by familiar ghost-quieting tropes (e.g., spectral bride’s rage). Some fresh metaphors ("trapped fireflies," "kaleidoscopic heart") but diluted by overwrought descriptors ("wispy bride," "chaotic energy"). Tension between tradition and oblivion is compelling but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements fit cohesively in a technical sense but lack transformative integration. The dollhouse museum’s miniature scale could have amplified the intimate scale of Elias’ gesture, but the connection feels implied rather than executed. The central theme persists, but the story feels like proof-of-concept rather than fully realized work.</comment>
