<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (walking away from failure) is clear but feels imposed rather than organically earned through actions. The scowling farmer archetype lacks psychological complexity despite symbolic props, and the sudden grin undermines established sullenness with insufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plots a basic escape arc but struggles with internal logic. The "method" of quilt-stamp hybridization lacks mechanical plausibility, while the power station's reactivation feels pseudo-magical rather than story-driven. The compressed arc suffers from uneven pacing in its climactic shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Underwater atmosphere has visual specificity with bioluminescent algae and creaking metal, but setting remains superficially renderedâ€”flooded city's history unexplored. Sensory details occasionally verge on sensory overload while key emotional beats rely on visual metaphors alone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stamps-as-boundary-erasure symbolism attempts thematic depth but remains surface-level. Quilt-as-legacy metaphor is promising yet over-explained, undermining subtlety. Memorable imagery (farmer-as-hero cape) exists despite ending that feels more poetic than earned through prior narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (drowned metropolis power station, anti-hero's cape) shine, but overwritten descriptions ("cracking sullenness", "patchwork truth") verge on artificial flourishes. Emotional shifts feel telegraphed rather than organically developed through character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements unite structurally but lack transformative synergy. The quilt-as-McGuffin ties narrative together formally, but thematic exploration feels checklist-driven rather than revelatory. Ambition exceeds execution but maintains baseline cohesion.</comment>
