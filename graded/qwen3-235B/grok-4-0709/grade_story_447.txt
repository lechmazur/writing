<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but relies excessively on the magical toy ear rather than internal complexity; actions align with traits but lack nuanced emotional depth or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels compressed; the magical method introduces key developments, yet the tight word limit leaves resolution feeling abrupt and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amber prison metaphor is evocative but inconsistently realized; sensory details are present but occasionally generic, limiting full immersion in the setting's thematic role.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and atmosphere; narrative shows more than tells but struggles to balance lyrical prose with cohesive emotional resonance and subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Some originality in magical realism approach, but leans on tropes (e.g., magical object) without subverting expectations; prose occasionally slips into overwritten descriptions and predictable emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mix of compelling ideas and uneven execution; elements fit thematically but lack the polish and structural precision demanded by top-tier literature despite clear conceptual ambition.</comment>
