<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While Elias’s stoicism is consistent, his internal conflict lacks depth; motivations are stated rather than psychologically nuanced, weakening emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot adheres to its tight structure, but progression feels schematic; the symbolic act of sending the cameo drives the narrative, though resolution lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust motes as fireflies, miniature landmarks) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that mirrors Elias’s internal tension and the story’s thematic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (cameo as rebellion, orchard as conformity) and subtext elevate the story; however, the ending’s ambiguity risks diluting thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose balances poetic imagery with clarity, avoiding overt clichés, but occasional abstraction (“cynical warmth”) veers toward self-conscious lyricism rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually, but the brevity limits narrative stakes; the story lingers thematically but lacks structural ambition to fully transcend its constraints.</comment>
