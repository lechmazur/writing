<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but under-explored; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth, relying on poetic description over substantive development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot effectively uses the holiday meal and overload, though rapid supernatural transitions strain logical cause-and-effect; resolution feels slightly rushed but mostly cohesive within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric contrasts (ethereal light vs. mechanical creaks) create immersive, original mood; setting/timeframe interplay is masterful in establishing melancholic wonder.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and metaphor elevate the narrative; theme of reviving wonder emerges organically, though emotional beats occasionally rely on overt descriptors ("joyful terror") rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains moments of over-polished prose and predictable ghostly tropes; some adverb-heavy descriptions border on purple prose, slightly undercutting uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively to support a clear thematic arc; the brevity enhances rather than limits scope; the ending resonates, suggesting broader implications of the bard's mission.</comment>
