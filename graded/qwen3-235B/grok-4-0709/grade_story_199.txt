<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's overzealousness drives actions, but motivation to catch a goddess echo feels underexplored beyond surface plot; interactions lack emotional nuance, voice remains overly abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot builds to a climax, but the rapid encounters-through-chance-structure feels contrived; pacing uneven but serviceable within tight limits; conclusion resolves arc but lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in post-human atmosphere; urban orchard's decayed-reborn duality enhances themes; timeframe's dreamlessness haunts setting effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose employs potent symbolism (notebook as inherited obsession, fluctuating hues), but relies too heavily on abstract phrasing; ending offers thematic closure yet remains emotionally distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("sound like cracking branches") and overly conceptual abstractions; metaphors verge on clich√©; emotional landscape lacks visceral authenticity despite strong premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive conceptually but strained by uneven execution; elements support theme yet occasionally feel like checklist items; haunting atmosphere lingers, but human connection remains elusive.</comment>
