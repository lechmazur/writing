<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are abstractly poetic but lack psychological depth; Janko's actions align with his assigned traits but remain symbolic rather than emotionally resonant, sacrificing human complexity for metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks significant forward motion; static meditation on despair dominates, with the poetry-as-mastery concept feeling more like thematic exhibitionism than narrative progression. Pacing undulates unevenly despite contained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting's surreal specifics (floating yoga studio, cloud-woven mats) create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details over-prioritize visual spectacle over tactile immersion. Contrasts between levitating serenity and Janko's inner bleakness are effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Poetic imagery ("frantic whirl inked absurd patterns") and meta-commentary on illusion-dismantling create intellectual resonance. Ending's paradoxical "absurd triumph" lingers, though emotional connection remains elusive beneath stylization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on ornamental abstraction ("aurora-kissed horizon"), but the clock hand/promise metaphor interplay demonstrates ingenuity. Emotion conveyed through symbolism over subtext, with moments of overexplained metaphor undercutting nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Elements coexist without optimal synergy; the floating studio's eccentricity occasionally competes with character pathos. However, the jagged generosity motif and time-obsessed melancholy suggest deliberate, if uneven, thematic layering.</grade>
