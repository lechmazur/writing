<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth beyond initial setup; moral code drives actions but internal conflict is underexplored. Voice and reactions feel somewhat generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on contrived plot mechanics (e.g., tea-steeping timeframe) and resolves too quickly; pacing uneven but functional within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive VR Roman marketplace; atmosphere aligns with thematic duality of past/present but underexploits symbolic potential of setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (tea/steam/timeframe parallels) elevate the narrative; ending delivers emotional weight by showing rather than telling, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of historical and technological elements avoids overt clich√©s but contains occasional mechanical descriptions ("confident uncertainty") and relies on AI-generated "depth" tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambition and thematic coherence outweigh thin characterizations; tech-past hybrid concept lingers, but emotional impact remains restrained by brevity.</comment>
