<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's blankness serves as thematic vessel but lacks emotional grounding; motivations tie to surreal concept but traits like "uniquely typical" remain abstract without behavioral manifestations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through moon-path ritual and rumor approval but suffers from fragmented momentum; cause-effect logic exists within the dreamlike framework though beginning/end cohesion weakens under word-limit compression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush, immersive setting evokes visceral contrasts—waterlogged piano, silver-lit ferns—but sensory details unevenly distributed; waterfall-orchard visuals dominate while tactile/auditory elements (e.g. piano's physicality, ring's texture) underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g. "veins of liquid silver") and thematic layers about ephemeral truths create intellectual resonance, but emotional engagement stunted by detached narrator; ending lacks transcendent payoff despite strong symbolic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Conceptual innovation shines through surreal premises (carnival relic as truth-meter) and paradoxical archetypes, though some phrasing ("whispers into mist") skews generic; balances poetic abstraction against risk of hollow formalism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Meticulously styled elements cohere into atmospheric whole but strain under symbolic density; brevity works thematically yet sacrifices character nuance; lingering question about obsession vs. purpose feels intentional but underexplored.</comment>
