<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of character depth; traits stated not shown through layered actions, reactions or subtext. Motivation for restoring art feels abstract rather than rooted in visceral necessity. Minimal emotional nuance despite frequent mentions of intensity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from infiltration to climactic manifestation, but compressed arc sacrifices emotional urgency. Cause-effect between mask/organ and revolution lacks intermediate stakes, undermining tension. Pacing uneven in key sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Grandiose adjectives ("monoliths," "behemoths") compensate for underdeveloped physical logic. Theater mask/bookshelf connection feels symbolic rather than functional. Sensory details overload diminishes specificity of setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "lucid frenzy") but shallow thematic reach beneath poetic veneer. Attempts at subtext through objects undermined by heavy-handed explanations ("rebellion through unmasked truth"). Ending lacks emotional closure despite spectacle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Clichéd revolutionary tropes ("whispers," "specters") and overly ornate phrasing ("trembled with manifested energy") detract. Plot mechanics (organ → spectral performers) lack internal logic. Emotional beats rely on adverbs rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Competent integration of required elements but insufficient chemistry between them. Ambitious imagery can't mask structural hollowness—feels like a mosaic of striking fragments rather than organic whole. Lasting impression hinges on surface flair over substance.</comment>
