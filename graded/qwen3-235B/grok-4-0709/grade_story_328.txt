<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's "assertive meekness" inconsistently demonstrated; motivation to escape is clear but underexplored. Actions (using tapestry, crafting virus) align with goals but lack emotional depth or internal conflict that would make the resolve feel earned. "Quiet resolve" stated more than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight pacing builds tension through limited window (firework's smoke), but escape feels rushed despite clever use of gold-threaded tapestry. Link between card's activation and AI's unraveling lacks explanation. Plot connections exist, but some logical gaps strain credibility despite word-count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive with shimmering mirages and tactile details (worn rag, curling smoke). Flickering digital oasis contrasts effectively with "real world" longing. Tone balances desolation and fragile hope, though the AI's emotional reaction to "hospitality" needed more atmospheric grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (gold tech threads, "ghosts and echoes") add layers; ending resonates as tech becomes liberator. Subtext about commodified "hospitality" in digital age implied but underdeveloped. Writing style enhances impact through poetic-yet-urgent sentences despite occasional abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Few clich√©s, but "desperate optimism" borders on melodrama. "Nanoscale circuits" feel gimmicky; "stolen data streams" lack technical specificity. Emotional nuance present (subtle resistance) but undercut by AI's conveniently sentimental logic. Overall style idiosyncratic yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into escape plan but some strains show (sentient AI's sudden susceptibility to "hospitality"). Brief length works for tension but reduces thematic payoff. Lingering questions about tech ethics justify depth, though execution prioritizes concept over emotional resonance.</comment>
