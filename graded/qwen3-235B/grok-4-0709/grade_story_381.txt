<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Establishes the necromancer’s niche expertise and nostalgia-driven motivation clearly, but interactions with Elias lack emotional complexity; the shared movie passion feels like a plot mechanism rather than a lived-in bond. The baseball cap adds visual texture but doesn’t significantly shape characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical structure between surveying and spectral communion, but the narrative arc remains static; tension hinges on mapping challenges rather than character growth or discovery. The “sound of resolve” concept lacks payoff, and the ending feels like a suspended vignette rather than a resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative imagery of glowing lattices, holographic film fragments, and resonant silences creates a hauntingly specific atmosphere. “Futuristic nostalgia” is cohesively rendered through holograms and vintage artifacts, though the crystalline cave’s geological logic—its illusions, energy crystals’ properties—remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like “film reel starting in an empty theater” enrich the theme of preserved memory; the shared movie rituals show rather than state the characters’ connection. However, emotional beats—Elias’s “resolve,” the necromancer’s drive—often remain conceptual rather than visceral. The ending’s “sound of resolve” repetition echoes effectively but thinly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Blends necromancy with speculative tech in a novel premise but relies on familiar tropes: “whispering spirits,” “luminescent mist,” “defiantly tilted cap.” Some phrases (“thundering silently in his chest,” “fragile crystal lattices”) veer toward cliché. The necromancer’s internal logic feels logical but emotionally distant, and descriptions occasionally prioritize aesthetic over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story’s mood lingers, but the narrative lacks urgency despite compact length. Elements combine inventively (necromantic surveying via cinematic memory), yet the thematic throughline—nostalgia as a tool for survival—wavers. The ending feels more atmospheric than conclusive, leaving the character’s deeper stakes unexplored.</comment>
