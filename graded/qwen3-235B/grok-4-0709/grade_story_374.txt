<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters remain static archetypes; motivations are stated but underdeveloped. The reconciliation feels abrupt, with minimal emotional or psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc is minimal but coherent; coffee line timeframe creates artificial pacing. The conflict's resolution through cloud-reading feels contrived rather than earned through prior buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid, contradictory imagery (synthetic pastures/holographic ads vs cosmic mysticism) creates memorable cognitive dissonance, though some elements like "bizarrely typical" dilute atmospheric consistency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Surface-level metaphors about unity lack emotional resonance. Dialogue is purposeful but lacks subtext; ending's "mundane magic" feels more aspirational than effectively rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Blends genre tropes (feuding mystics) with surreal inventions (cosmic rubber stamps), but overreliance on the "bizarrely typical" descriptor betrays formulaic conceptualization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution. Integration of elements is functional but uneven; the synthesis of mystical/futuristic themes lacks philosophical depth despite clever juxtapositions.</comment>
