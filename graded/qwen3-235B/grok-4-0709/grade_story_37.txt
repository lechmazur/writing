<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character motivations (redemption, guilt) are clear but underexplored; "dishonest honesty" feels stated rather than dramatized through decisions; past actions don’t fully align with present reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on crumpled sheet music revelations, but the compressed progression from anxiety to self-realization feels rushed; cause/effect relationships (e.g., waiting room → flashbacks) are logical but superficially connected.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lush rainforest imagery (vines, bamboo clock) creates vivid physical space, but atmosphere lacks deeper integration with emotional stakes; mist, humidity, and "sacred ember" evoke mood but remain decorative rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses yodeling as symbolic contrast and reveals (forged notes → honest voice) effectively; emotional beats lean on explicit exposition (e.g., "dishonest honesty" defined outright) rather than subtext; ending’s thematic unity is undercut by abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids "rainforest" clichés with specific details (woven-leaf nests, storm-reinforced platforms), but occasionally slips into ornate descriptors ("hummed with unspoken worries"); metaphors (flame as future’s light) feel familiar; emotional resonance is undercut by formulaic redemptive arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are present but unevenly synthesized; yodel and sheet music excel, while "rainforest canopy village" and "waiting room silence" feel more like backdrops than integral components; potential for deeper thematic cohesion unmet.</comment>
