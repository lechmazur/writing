<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "faithfully unfaithful" trait is stated but not dramatized through meaningful actions; late-blooming motivation feels abstract rather than embodied through visceral character choices; "brusque affection" dialogue doesn't fully differentiate voice from narrative prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot hinges on convenient deciphering of sundial without showing the intellectual/emotional struggle of decoding; transition to hidden crystal lacks causal logic; ending feels abrupt despite tight word count, missing final beat showing cost/consequence of discovery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative moonlit museum atmosphere with prehistoric bones creates eerie cosmic intimacy; sensory details like skylight angles and silent howls deepen mood; crystal's galactic pulse connects setting to theme without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (matchbox as potential, crystal as wild bird) elevate beyond surface plot; ending's emotional payoff is diluted by overreliance on sentimental similes; theme of late blooming needs sharper textual embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phrase "brusque affection" repeats unnecessarily; dinosaur skeleton setting could have richer symbolic ties to cosmic scale; "faithfully unfaithful" trait feels more like ornament than narrative driver; overly elaborate descriptors sometimes slow momentum.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements create cohesive whole but strain under demand to incorporate all assigned details; some concepts (sundial, orchard dog) function as disconnected ciphers rather than organic story components; lingering questions about cosmic ethics could inspire discussion but clarity suffers.</comment>
