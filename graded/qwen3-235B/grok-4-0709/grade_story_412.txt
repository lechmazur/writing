<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's bookishness and flaws are present but underexplored; motivation for control vaguely tied to failures, but lacks emotional depth. Assigned object (key) ties to backstory but doesn't fully reveal character nuance during action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Assigned action (soothing via nightmares) drives the plot, but pacing feels truncated; cyclical nightmares concept lacks buildup. Pacing is uneven between exposition and climax, weakening narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setting (frequency station) creates eerie atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse; tone of "mournful elation" isn't fully embodied beyond stated emotions. Object-setting cohesion weak beyond surface.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of control vs. freedom and cyclical trauma offer subtext, undercut by overreliance on telling over showing. Ending achieves symbolic resonance but lacks emotional gut-punch. Writing style is poetic but occasionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Certain phrases feel contrived ("whispers," "symphony of controlled harmony"). Motivation follows predictable utopian tyrant trope without subversion. Emotions are explicitly stated over nuanced portrayal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained; some elements (geographical ineptitude) feel tacked on. Limited length exposes thin exploration of themes. Lingering impact is minimal despite evocative imagery.</comment>
