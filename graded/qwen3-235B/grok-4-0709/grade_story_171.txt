<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are visually linked to plot but psychological depth remains surface-level; obsession shown through actions but emotional complexity feels stated rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression exists but relies on contrived discoveries; cause-and-effect coherence falters with sudden resolution of listening to bootlegs; narrative arcs compressed with uneven pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile descriptions of decaying carnival mechanics and ephemeral light; sensory details immerse readers but struggle to fully integrate with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (magic in stamps, "ravenously gentle") are conceptually striking but occasionally collapse under over-literalization; ending achieves thematic cohesion but leans on sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through bicycle-carnival ingenuity but contains ornate descriptors ("splintered whispers of paint") that prioritize style over emotional authenticity; underdeveloped character psychology weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story functions as a self-contained piece but feels artificially compressed; thematic potential about connection vs. isolation lingers while structural unevenness prevents full realization.</comment>
