<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but lack psychological nuance; actions align with assigned traits but inner conflict remains abstract rather than visceral. Voice insufficiently distinct for a "awed astronomer" as narrator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from discovery to symbolic rebellion, but the pivotal "cultivation" process feels conceptually compressed; pacing generally efficient but resolution risks oversimplification of emotional consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through crystalline imagery and glacial decay; specific details like refracted light patterns and skeletal trees enhance thematic coherence. Timeframe's emotional void is visually realized but emotionally unexplored beyond surface descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (idol, snowflake logic, veil) create layered meaning; ending achieves emotional resonance. Subtext about emotion's necessity is clear but occasionally undercut by heavy-handed exposition like "his last flicker of wonder." </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through fractal/organic fusion but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("crystal shadows," "rational caution"). Subtle emotional subtext exists but struggles against overly metaphorical language that distances reader.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into cohesive aesthetic; themes of controlled emotion persist throughout. Some aspects like snowflake methodology feel contrived rather than organically integrated, though overall the tightly compressed narrative achieves thematic closure.</comment>
