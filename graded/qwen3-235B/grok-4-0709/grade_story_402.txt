<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Baron's motivation for forsaking estate lacks depth; actions driven more by concept than revealed humanity; silent communication with specter feels symbolic but hollow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative has clear arc but limited cause/effect—raft's launch feels abrupt; pacing struggles with compression; coherence held by atmospheric momentum rather than structural rigor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and original; synesthetic details (glowing doubt, tactile bone/soil interplay) create immersive decay; atmosphere directly shapes character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("mirror to futures unseen") elevate prose; poetic tone sustains reflection on memory/time; emotional resonance weakened by distanced third-person; theme of archiving human frailty remains under-embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story avoids major clichés but stumbles into ornate abstraction ("veins between bones"); communication method lacks psychological texture; some phrases (e.g., "luminous doubt") feel overwritten yet purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Conceptually tight integration of elements (roots/archiving), but short length sacrifices emotional gravity; themes of forgotten knowledge linger, while character remains abstract. </grade>
