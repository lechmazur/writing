<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations feel abstract rather than deeply personal; Elias' obsession with "unconventional love" lacks psychological complexity, and his fixation on Lira remains superficial despite lush descriptions. The apothecary's expertise driving the plot is clear, but emotional stakes feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The confined word limit forces compressed plotting; the morse code-to-butterfly infection mechanism strains credulity, and the Lira subplot feels truncated. While the story achieves a circular structure through the submarine's mechanical groaning, the balance between action and thematic weight tilts unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral use of steampunk submarine details (hissing steam, riveted iron) and abyssal imagery creates a haunting, immersive atmosphere. Sensory specifics about ink evaporation and glowing morse code enhance coherence, though the bio-engineered butterflies slightly clash with the setting's grit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("gears whimper like hearts," "pollens of forgotten flora") deepen thematic resonance, but emotional beats rely too heavily on telling ("yearned to infect her with this same love"). The ending's poetic closure satisfies thematically but feels contrived rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some lush but uneven prose: "unjustly fair" resurfaces artificially as both aesthetic and moral critique; "battered marvel" motif is effective but overemphasized. The highlighter pen's improvisation shows ingenuity, though the butterflies-as-carriers conceit leans on fantastical logic without full buy-in.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story's ambition to merge biopunk romance with geopolitical allegory intrigues, but the brief's constraints create seams. The submarine setting and unconventional love theme provide cohesion, though certain elements (Morse code, "dry highlighter") strain toward gimmickry.</comment>
