<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation is clear but psychological depth lacks complexity. The attribute “clumsily dexterous” is demonstrated mechanically, not emotionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but relies heavily on convenience (e.g., crowd instantly dispersing). The arc is complete within constraints, but pacing feels slightly rushed in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create atmosphere, but the witch’s cauldron room feels more decorative than foundational to the narrative. Tone and setting partially align but lack deeper thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effectively uses metaphor (silence as critique) and subtext, though emotional resonance is uneven. Ending is poignant but risks oversimplification. Prose avoids overt clichés but occasionally borders on poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in merging sound engineering with magical realism, but some phrases (“whispered secrets to the shadows”) verge on cliché. Motivational logic remains plausible, avoiding mechanistic rigidity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not transcendentally cohesive. Conceptual ambition exists, but the story’s brevity leaves thematic exploration feeling surface-level.</comment>
