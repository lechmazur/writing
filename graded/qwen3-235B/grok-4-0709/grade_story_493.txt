<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's prudent nature and ancestry quest drive his actions, but his "mysteriously cheerful" demeanor lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but reactions to the letters remain surface-level without emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc from discovery to revelation, but the transformation of the station into a ceremonial procession strains credibility; pacing manages the word limit well but the ending feels abrupt without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative Minoan imagery (frescoes, ritual chambers) bolsters atmosphere, but sensory details lean decorous over purposeful; modern subway elements feel juxtaposed rather than fully integrated, diluting the "familiar unknown" tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Linguistic and symbolic motifs deepen thematic resonance; the ending’s ritualistic pulse offers subtext about heritage’s cyclical nature, though overreliance on lyrical abstraction occasionally obscures emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong conceptual fusion of past/future avoids cliché, but metaphorical consistency falters (e.g., "palace mazes" vs. "train rumble"); language occasionally veers into ornamental excess without purposeful restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fundamentally cohesive and thematic, with individual elements supporting the narrative’s DNA-centric core; some forced phrasing and uneven prose polish prevent seamless immersion despite inventive premise.</comment>
