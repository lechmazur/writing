<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivation is conceptually clear but unmotivated and psychologically inconsistent with underdeveloped responses to supernatural stimuli.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Looming resolution works structurally within constraints but relies on compressed exposition rather than earned tension; momentum propelled by procedural action sequences outweighs character stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush but superficially Gothic; setting functions decoratively rather than thematically with inconsistent symbolic integration of roller coaster mechanics and existential themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid lyricism elevates imagery and metaphor, though cerebral conceits occasionally overpower emotional resonance; ending introduces conceptual irony undercut by detached narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>7</grade><comment>Prose straddles lush description and abstract concept effectively but falters into ornate overexplaining; originality diluted by genre tropes like haunted carnival decay and riddle-driven plots.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Vague thematic coherence between obsession and impermanence exists but lacks emotional specificity; high-concept elements overwhelm human-scale meaning extraction.</comment>
