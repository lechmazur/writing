<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underexplored; actions align with assigned traits (solitary, inventive) but inner conflicts feel simplified; the mirror-beast as a manifestation is effective but lacks depth in its interaction with Elias.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot's quantum logic drives progression, but the condensed structure undermines emotional payoff; the lighthouse demolition bookends the story but feels externally imposed rather than organically connected to Elias's arc; pacing prioritizes imagery over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quantum beach's paradoxical nature (shimmering haze, probabilistic sand) creates immersive sensory dissonance; corroded rapture tone is consistently evoked through decaying yet beautiful imagery; setting and emotional undertones fuse effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (mirror-beast, waveform-collapsing steps) convey thematic unity, but emotional resonance relies too heavily on abstract descriptors like "tarnished joy" rather than earned pathos; ending feels poetically conclusive without earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Predictable thematic binaries (mediocrity/visionary, decay/creation) undercut originality; phrases like "quantum foam" and "eternal hush" verge on genre clich√©s; the corroded rapture motif is fresh but over-explained; emotional arcs feel stated rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements integrate conceptually but lack narrative interdependence; quantum mechanics as metaphor feels forced in places; brevity limits thematic payoff; closing image of a redefined reflection lingers but feels more aesthetic than profound.</comment>
