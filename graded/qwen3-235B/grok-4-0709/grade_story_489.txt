<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is functional but lacks psychological depth; aggressively kind trait drives actions but remains more of a label than a nuanced quality through specific emotional reactions or subtle interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tight 3-part structure (ritual buildup, triggering event, aftermath) works within constraints; cause/effect between whale call, whistle toss, and ritual revival is clear, though the dancer's abrupt insight feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (salt-crusted glass, ghostly sighs, whale-song vibrations) create immersive atmosphere that reinforces thematic tension between decay and preservation of traditions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric language ("plastic form catching lantern's light before plunging into waves") and layered meaning elevate the story, though emotional impact feels slightly attenuated by omnipotential narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original juxtaposition of mundane plastic whistle with spiritual rituals avoids cliche; prose remains purposeful despite occasional ornateness, with emotional resonances implied through atmospheric shifts rather than explicit declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; precise imagery and central metaphor carry weight, but brevity compresses emotional arcs into shorthand rather than fully articulated progression.</comment>
