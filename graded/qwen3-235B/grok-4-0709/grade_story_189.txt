<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elara's literal nature shapes her actions but lacks emotional nuance; her "bright-eyed" optimism feels stated rather than demonstrated through lived behavior. The connection between her trait and decoding maps is functional but underdevelops how her literalism might clash/interact with supernatural elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Causal logic holds: notes → key activation → cosmic revelation. However, the final stabilization through another note feels contrived convenience rather than earned resolution. Pacing falters during the console sequence, which overwhelms the word limit with technical description over narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid decay of the post-war world and haunted lighthouse atmosphere impress, but the phone booth key’s connection to "spectral whispers" strains credibility. Inconsistent tone—mixing cosmic optimism with spectral horror—weakens the cohesion of its haunting setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Star-as-circuit-board imagery offers striking metaphorical potential undercut by flat emotional beats; the ending’s "redemption" relies on exposition rather than earned catharsis. Central conflict (salvation through decoding) remains surface-level, never questioning the ethics of fleeing a ruined Earth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality stumbles in predictable beats (ghostly notes guiding exposition) and stilted phrases like "water-abundant worlds" that read as algorithmically chosen. The literalist protagonist has potential, but her rigid personality emerges more through narration than lived choices, making her seem like a concept rather than a person.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overreliance on assigned elements as plot devices (ghost notes, booth key) creates structural scaffolding rather than organic narrative. The haunting conclusion gestures toward "hope" but lacks thematic heft—salvation feels technologically inevitable, not earned through character or thematic complexity.</comment>
