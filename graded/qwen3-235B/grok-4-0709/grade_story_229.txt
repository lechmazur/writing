<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters act as thematic vessels more than fully developed people; Mira's anguish feels surface-level, Elias's curiosity lacks visceral grounding in his actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc but relies on unexplained leaps in logic (rain patterns = time reconstruction); poetic momentum partially compensates for narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rain, rust, decay, and phosphorescent shells create an immersive, tactile atmosphere where cosmic and intimate blend seamlessly; setting becomes a character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor (e.g. "raindrops mapping forgotten voyages") elevates theme of ephemeral human connection; understated ending rewards active readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyrical passages shine, but occasional overwritten phrases ("cosmic intimacy's storm-swept graveyard") risk self-parody; emotional states often told rather than shown through character behavior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a meditation on futile legacy, though resonators' mechanics strain credibility; brevity amplifies melancholy but sacrifices character depth.</comment>
