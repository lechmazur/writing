<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and motivations, but their complexity remains surface-level; fickle loyalty influences key choices yet feels underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concise plot progression from theater framing to core journey, but diary's introduction strains pacing; assimilation arc lacks sufficient emotional buildup for rebellion's resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, visceral worldbuilding with ultraviolet aesthetics and tactile sensations, though theater framing conflicts tonally with ethereal forest sections; sensory cohesion overall impressive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance between waves/ladder math and freedom costs elevates narrative; ending's thematic crystallization through poetic final line transcends plot contrivances.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Richly original fusion of maritime and woodland surrealism undercut by occasional ornate phrasing ("coldly intense gaze that pierced dim light"); character psychology feels more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compelling fusion of elements creates memorable speculative parable, though framing device and shifting loyalties occasionally create narrative instability; thematic ambition exceeds technical execution.</comment>
