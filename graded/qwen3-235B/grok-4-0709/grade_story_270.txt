<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and motivation are clear but could delve deeper into his internal conflict; actions align with traits, though emotional nuance feels somewhat surface-level despite atmospheric hints of regret.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight, coherent arc within the constraint, with incantation as a logical driving action; resolution could benefit from subtler foreshadowing, but the ending's thematic symmetry is satisfyingly inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are immersive, with evocative sensory details (scent of salt, canyon echoes) seamlessly enhancing mood; the lighthouse and globe are integral to tone and theme without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling is lyrical yet precise, balancing metaphor (e.g., "borrowed time," "spectral essence") with emotional subtext; the ending's bittersweet irony resonates, though some lyrical flourishes border on self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting "rescue" tropes, but certain phrases ("whispered secrets," "haunting symphonies") risk clich√©; emotional depth is implied through situation more than fully embodied character reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole; brevity serves elegiac tone, though the final reflection leans on melancholy without probing deeper existential questions the premise implies.</comment>
