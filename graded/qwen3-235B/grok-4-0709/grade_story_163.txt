<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; reliance on internal monologue undermines nuanced emotional development though the parking stub ties identity to action effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a complete arc but feels compressed; action drives momentum yet some transitions (e.g., detour decision) lack organic buildup, diluting tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory-rich descriptions of sentient clouds and xenobiology station, though deeper integration of setting with character psychology could enhance thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses potent metaphors ("storm of bitterly optimistic resolve") and conveys existential themes, but relies on told emotions rather than fully dramatized character reactions to subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some vivid imagery contrasts with predictable tropes (exiled aristocrat, AI corruption) and overly ornate phrasing; emotional nuance is occasionally sacrificed for atmospheric abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not all feel indispensable; the parking stub stands out as uniquely integrated while other components occasionally read as genre scaffolding rather than organic necessity.</comment>
