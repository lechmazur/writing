<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character’s desert origins marginally inform his resourcefulness but inner conflict remains underdeveloped; motivation feels assigned rather than naturally emerging from nuanced psychology. "Eagerly unwilling" behavior lacks visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum hinges on deciphering the tapestry but execution feels compressed; the unraveling as both catastrophe and catalyst works conceptually but lacks visceral cause-effect tension necessary for a resonant arc within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Alpine monastery’s sensory details (chill, chants, herb gardens) immerse effectively; juxtaposition of desert chaser against alpine austerity is stark but occasionally feels contrived rather than thematically symbiotic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (storms, tongs, tapestry) carry thematic weight but rely on familiar dualities; ending resonates poetically but emotional payoff feels muted by overly abstract handling of inner strength and innovation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Language veers toward poetic cliché ("forgotten prayer," "whirlwind of dust and thunder"); character psychology leans on tropes of trauma/redemption; deeper subtext or tonal idiosyncrasy is scarce despite atmospheric strengths.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements but prioritizes aesthetic cohesion over narrative urgency; premise’s emotional core—repairing self through repairing objects—is promising but unevenly rendered within word constraints.</comment>
