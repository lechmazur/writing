<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; phobias and "dance on madness" feel imposed rather than organically tied to realistic psychology. Motivation remains abstract and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progression strains credibility under word count; sudden acquisition of key artifacts lacks narrative weight. Climax feels underprepared despite linear structure. Pacing fluctuates between rushed and stagnant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory fragments (humid Saturdays, rusted objects) but struggles to connect garagesale mundanity to pyramid's otherworldliness. Moods contrast effectively but lack sustained cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mirroring between knot-unraveling and fear-liberation provides thematic backbone. Recurring "mundanely spiritual" motif works subtextually. Somewhat undermined by melodramatic overtones in delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mix of evocative phrases ("darkness pressed like living thing") and vague descriptors ("ancient whispers") creates uneven tone. Stunt-double backstory leans on clich√© rather than subversive reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Elements work collectively but unevenly; garage sale framework cleverly binds artifacts yet pyramid's inclusion feels arbitrary. Final revelation offers thematic closure but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
