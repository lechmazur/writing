<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to reclaim identity is clear, consistent, and drives actions. Obsessive calm tone is maintained, though internal psychology could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from scapegoat to self-reclamation, but the abrupt transition from finding the washer to midnight calls feels underdeveloped given the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Cloud City's misty, ephemeral realm is vividly rendered through sensory details (e.g., corrosive clouds, whispering glyphs) and thematically tied to themes of fragility and erasure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (washer as key) and layered subtext (scapegoating as identity erosion) elevate the story. Ending feels emotionally resonant and thematically unified.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through speculative elements (engineered vapors, arcane phone calls). Prose balances lyricism with clarity; some metaphors (e.g., "floating on engineered vapors") feel fresh but not overstretched.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements intertwine seamlessly (scapegoat's guilt mirrors library purge; washer's "robust delicacy" reflects character). Ending invites reflection, though brevity slightly dilutes emotional payoff.</comment>
