<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lack of emotional depth in character interactions; motivations are clear but executed with surface-level nuance. Attributes shape actions but lack layered psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Basic three-act structure achieved, but compressed pacing leaves character arc and plot logic underdeveloped. Transitions between dialogue/renewal feel rushed within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptually vivid setting with dark matter diner/neon elements, but sensory details (sights, sounds) remain underdeveloped, diluting atmospheric immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism of missile arcs as reframed fears; dialogue achieves thematic resonance. Over-reliance on exposition weakens impact of character emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Subverts war-weary tropes through absurdity (rain that rains upward), but stumbles into clich√©s with "burnt-out spark." Some purple prose, but tonal consistency holds.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements partially cohesive but uneven: diner and photos stand out while temporal concepts (between rides) feel underutilized. Premise has potential but execution lacks refinement.</comment>
