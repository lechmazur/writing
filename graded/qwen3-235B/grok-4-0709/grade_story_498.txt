<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolic motivation against indifference is clear but underdeveloped; Elias's nervousness informs key actions but lacks nuanced inner conflict or humanizing contradictions beneath the allegorical surface.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arc from anxiety to transformation is coherent, but midwinter pacing rushes the youths’ pivotal shift; cause/effect between seed scattering and communal change feels simplified despite logical throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory immersion in icebound xenophobia is visceral—brittle husks, trembling frost—elevating tone; setting’s isolation mirrors thematic tension without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (germinating seeds vs. apathy) and subtext about fragile unity resonate, but ending’s tidy resolution undermines the complexity of "tyranny of indifference" with overly optimistic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in pairing xenophobia with botanical resilience exists, but "unlikely probable" phrasing leans on cliché against-odds tropes; dialogue feels archetypal rather than viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative thematically but occasionally strain plausibility; tone and atmosphere elevate a premise that adheres to constraints without transcending them into profundity.</comment>
