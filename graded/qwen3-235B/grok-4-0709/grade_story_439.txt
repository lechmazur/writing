<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; muteness and boldness are mentioned but not viscerally shown through reactions or decisions. Motivation is stated, not earned through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has faint arc but feels compressed; cause/effect logic is there but too abstract. Pacing drags in middle despite brevity, lacks concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and cohesive, though some descriptors verge on overwrought. Setting immerses but occasionally substitutes for narrative substance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors enrich the narrative but often feel cerebral over visceral. Ending offers thematic closure but lacks emotional bite or lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Blends mystical tropes (ancient guides, cosmic journeys) with unique flourishes. Overuse of adjectives and conceptual abstractions weakens originalityâ€™s impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</question><comment>Elements coexist but rarely collide meaningfully. Conceptual ambition clashes with the tight format; themes are explicit rather than organically revealed.</comment>
