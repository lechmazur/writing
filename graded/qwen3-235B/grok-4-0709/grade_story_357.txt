<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's habits and symbolic objects support motivation, but inner conflict remains surface-level. Flippant dialogue feels performative rather than deeply human, weakening emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Board game structure provides artificial scaffolding, but external elements like the party invitation lack organic integration. Pacing uneven—critical unraveling moment feels rushed despite deliberate rounds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Frost imagery creates immersive atmosphere that mirrors internal isolation. Sensory details like the whispering air and icy game board enhance thematic cohesion through environmental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (Despair as wolf, solitude as fortress) are effective but derivative. The journal/black rose interplay offers subtle subtext, yet resolution feels more thematic than emotionally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Over-reliance on gothic tropes (isolated lair, personified despair) and ornate phrasing detracts from originality. Some transitions between game rounds feel mechanical. Unraveling invitation shows ingenuity but strains believability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cohesive surface design but thematic shallowness. Assigned elements function mechanically rather than organically advancing narrative. The "victory" lacks lasting resonance—more aesthetic than transformative.</comment>
