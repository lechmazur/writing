<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's central conflict is clear but underexplored; motivation is consistent but internalization feels superficial. Voice lacks distinction, reducing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven: library hours structure exists but scenes don't fully leverage time constraints. Wandering-to-resolution arc is too streamlined to carry emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Blended tech-nature setting has potential but relies on vague descriptors ("chaotic urban sprawl"). Sensory details surface-level; atmosphere doesn't deepen thematic tensions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (seeds, holograms) are functional but predictable. Ending attempts "transformation of chaos" theme but lacks subtext. Shows more than tells, yet feels familiar rather than evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Back-alley theater feels contrived as "anarchic inspiration." Overuse of "dented" and "lethargic excitement" suggests repetitive phrasing. Emotional beats are stated through metaphor rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but loosely connectedâ€”particularly theater method. Attempts thematic cohesion but lacks narrative daring; feels like checklist-driven writing rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
