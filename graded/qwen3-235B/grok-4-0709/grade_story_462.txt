<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motives are clear but execution borders on cliché; the 'weary traveler' archetype lacks depth despite poetic descriptions of internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motif-driven structure functions, but cause-effect logic strains plausibility (sound wave-induced sparks stretch suspension of disbelief). Pacing condenses well into the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory immersion almost compensates for underutilized house-of-mirrors potential; fog, metallic clanging, and fractured light create haunting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors and symbolic mirror multiplicities elevate the narrative; resolution feels slightly rushed despite resonant final lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original concept obscured by occasional purple prose ("gnashed at the shore like teeth") and overwrought abstraction. Avoids genre clichés but risks emotional detachment through preciousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery elevates core components, though thematic integration wavers. The brief format serves the introspective arc but undermines narrative depth.</comment>
