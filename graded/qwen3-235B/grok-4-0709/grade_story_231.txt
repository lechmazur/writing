<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pastoral melancholy informs Eresh's vengeful resolve, but his "sentimental" and "spontaneous" attributes feel superficially attached rather than organically influencing decisions. Motivation lacks psychological complexity despite strong symbolic underpinnings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chronological events cohere, but compressed scope makes confrontational climax feel rushed. The anchor's lifting as structural marker for temporal constraint is clever, though thematic pay-off arrives too abruptly, diminishing emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory descriptors (incense swirls, ziggurat shadows) establish period authenticity, but Sumerian specificity remains abstract. The Euphrates as metaphorical witness works well, though setting functions more as backdrop than active element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("equity blooms from upheaval's soil") undercut by explanatory overstatement. Memorable symbols (hairpin, coordinates) carry thematic weight, though didacticism weakens subtext. Emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on archaic diction ("vizier," "ziggurat") and redundant metaphors ("chaos as teacher"). Some fresh phrasing ("untamed spirits" of incense) exists within overly stylized prose that often obscures human nuance beneath ritualistic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>High-concept framework (justice/chaos/resilience) suggests thematic richness, but execution prioritizes symbolic density over organic development. Ambition exceeds word-count limitations, leaving ideas underexplored.</comment>
