<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contradictory traits (grogginess vs. grave purpose) poorly reconciled; motivation exists but lacks nuanced behavioral evidence; the "flippant solemnity" feels imposed rather than organically integrated through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Initiation via staircase stain lacks narrative logic; the protest's distant chants and mansion's supernatural elements create disjointed throughlines; transformation feels abrupt despite tight word constraints demanding tighter causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eerie tombstone whispers and protest murmurings create immersive atmosphere, but temporal fusion of political action and ghostly unrest lacks thematic synergy; sensory details occasionally veer toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original metaphor use (corruption as encroaching darkness, mirror shard as revolutionary symbol) elevates the narrative; "living manifesto" line demonstrates lyrical depth; emotional subtext remains somewhat surface-level beneath poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eccentric character-trait combinations show ingenuity but lean into gothic clichés; protest-mansion juxtaposition lacks genre subversion; "flippant solemnity" manifests more as authorial voice than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements mechanically present but mechanically fused - the mirror shard works best while protest context feels superficial; poetic style occasionally impedes clarity; transformation arc lacks visceral impact despite concept density.</comment>
