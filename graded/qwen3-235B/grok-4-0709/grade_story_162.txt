<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like carefree gambler and trustworthy are stated but underdeveloped; motivations and actions lack psychological depth, relying on surface-level descriptors rather than nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmentary plot mimics the blueprint’s disrepair but lacks narrative momentum; resolution feels abrupt, conflating atmosphere with structural coherence while failing to build tension or a meaningful arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie, cluttered workshop and unwatched videotapes evoke melancholy decay; however, the setting serves more as aesthetic mood-setting than a functional, integrated narrative environment shaping character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (“wires tangled like unresolved arguments”) and thematic focus on chaos/harmony elevate the prose, but emotional resonance is diluted by excessive summarization and a lack of visceral, lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ambiguous blend of noir and tech-thriller tropes avoids overt formulaicity but slips into decorative melancholia; character reasoning (e.g. Lena’s passivity) feels overly calculated, with sensory details occasionally veering into vague abstraction (“hush of forgotten recordings”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements are technically cohesive but underexploited; the workshop’s specificity and blueprint’s mystery demand deeper narrative integration, while the brevity sacrifices thematic payoff, leaving more questions than revelations.</comment>
