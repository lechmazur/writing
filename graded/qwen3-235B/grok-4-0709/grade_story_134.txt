<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's obnoxious politeness feels performative rather than deeply rooted, with motivation for cultural preservation remaining abstract rather than viscerally connected to specific actions or consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear plot structure functions but struggles with brevityâ€”climactic chaos feels abrupt, thematic resolution underdeveloped despite tight word constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Melodramatic whimsy undermines conceptual brilliance; elements coexist rather than synergize, with themes skimming surfaces rather than penetrating deeply.</comment>
