<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakened by overly stated emotions; character's internal conflict lacks nuanced manifestation through actions. The woodsman and lost love elements are archetypal rather than deeply individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through the echo-mapping action, but the shift from mapping to spiritual redemption feels underdeveloped. Pacing is efficient but occasionally rushed in emotional transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Radio wave garden's sensory specifics are vivid but inconsistent in application. The setting's surreal qualities don't fully integrate with character motivation or thematic content.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic imagery elevates the central metaphor, but some emotional beats rely on direct statement rather than subtext. The convergence of mapping and confession creates meaningful resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original setting conception undercut by occasional purple prose ("humidity of forgotten signals"). Emotional progression shows human nuance in confession but some descriptive language borders on clich√©d poetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but unevenly integrated elements create a fragmented effect. The core metaphor works, but tighter synthesis between spiritual and physical realms would improve overall impact.</comment>
