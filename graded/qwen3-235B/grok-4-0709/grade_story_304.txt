<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lack of depth in character backstory and nuance. Motivation is stated rather than earned through layered actions or emotional resonance; Elias's actions align with his role but remain psychologically opaque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but feel compressed. High-concept setup resolves predictably despite clever traps; the artificial sun's symbolic role in the timeframe is underdeveloped, weakening the arc's emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Visually rich setting overwhelms functional worldbuilding. Baroque asteroid's aesthetic dominates over organic integration with Elias's mission; "borrowed starlight" tone creates mood but lacks thematic interplay with character struggle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overreliance on abstract metaphors (cradling dawn, spiderweb patterns) creates emotional distance rather than connection. The camera lens device shows ingenuity but feels underutilized beyond surface irony; ending lacks earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Prose alternates between purple passages and schematic descriptions. Character logic (e.g. multi-year plan requiring only basic tripwires) clashes with setting complexity; clich√©d "laughing at death" trope feels algorithmically chosen rather than character-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements combined mechanically rather than organically. While conceptually cohesive (e.g., spiderweb-trapped road), thematic unity collapses under scrutiny; fails to transcend genre expectations despite ambitious imagery.</comment>
