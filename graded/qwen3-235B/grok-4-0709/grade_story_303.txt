<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weak integration of "naturally peculiar" into character actions; motivation to map cognitive patterns remains surface-level despite explicit statement; shared mourning ritual reveals character depth through action but feels more thematic than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative arc collapses under word constraints - accidental meeting lacks emotional buildup, mourning ritual to cosmic reprieve shift feels abrupt; cause-effect logic weakened by compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create hypnotic atmosphere but interdimensional portal's logic remains inconsistent (shifting colors vs "dignified chaos"); setting never interrogates its own surreal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "grief mapped in spices" work beautifully but emotional beats rely on poetic vagueness rather than character behavior; ending feels thematic but undershows.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Purple prose ("dignified chaos," "whispers...lingering like balm") dilutes impact; cultural mourning through spices original but echoes familiar magical realism tropes; mourning feels conceptual rather than viscerally rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements mechanically function but lack alchemical fusion - story's elegance remains decorative rather than transformative; emotional resonance undercut by poetic abstraction.</comment>
