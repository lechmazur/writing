<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness is present but motivation is inconsistently layered with his 'wholeheartedly broken' trait; transformation feels underdeveloped despite thematic hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels compressed—resolution arrives abruptly, weakening emotional payoff of the 500-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and immersive, but the ephemeral gallery's thematic connection to impermanence isn't thoroughly woven into the protagonist's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (melting sculptures, crystal vial) elevate the narrative, but some emotional beats rely on exposition over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Tropes (forbidden knowledge, redemptive sacrifice) dominate; language occasionally veers into overwritten descriptors ('dust-laden shelves,' 'demure boldness') lacking visceral precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack organic integration—theme of power's cost is clear, but narrative tension feels secondary to poetic flourishes.</comment>
