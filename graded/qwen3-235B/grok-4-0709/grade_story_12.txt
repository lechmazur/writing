<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While Elias' aloofness is established through detached descriptions and his mapping profession, emotional depth and character arcs lack nuance. Motivations around memory and soul-language feel abstract rather than viscerally earned through action. Dialogue scenes lack distinct voice, relying on symbolic resonance over organic interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually coherent but constrained by length. Pivotal moments (tile activation, meeting Mira, destiny exchange) feel compressed, creating artificial pacing. Connections between action and theme are conceptually clear but lack organic build-up; the rapid resolution feels predetermined rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The futuristic mall's sensory details (holograms, neon, quantum shoppers) create vivid atmosphere but prioritize aesthetic over thematic integration. The setting's technological chaos contrasts with the tile's antiquity, but this contrast isn't fully leveraged to deepen character or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (cracked tile as fractured memory, kayaking as bridge) elevates the story. The ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic imagery, though some thematic statements ("language of the soul") feel declarative rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the premise avoids overt clichés, certain phrases ("digital mirages") and the destiny-exchange trope lean toward poetic abstraction over concrete originality. Emotions are primarily shown through symbolic actions but occasionally undercut by explicit declarations of feeling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story demonstrates conceptual cohesion but uneven execution. Assigned elements are present but unevenly integrated—some (tile, destiny exchange) feel essential, others (futuristic setting) function more as backdrop than narrative driver. The ending suggests thematic depth but doesn't fully excavate it.</comment>
