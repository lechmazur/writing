<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are stylized and conceptually cohesive but lack deep psychological nuance; their motivations (preserving traditions through control) align with archetypes but lack unique voice or organic contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but strains under word constraints; the pottery class catalyst feels contrived, and the sudden alliance lacks tension despite clever thematic symmetry between locks/pots.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard and rooftop colonial setting are vividly realized with strong sensory details (e.g., "twisted apple trees," "whisper of hidden dangers") but occasionally undercut by overstatement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism elevate the story, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstract descriptors ("demure audacity," "delightfully menacing") that override subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with fresh setting but leans on ornate phrasing and archetypes (cynical hero, enigmatic rival); dialogue borders on performative, straining plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but uneven; elements like the throne and pottery class feel forced into symbolic roles, though the fusion of preservation-as-hunting and communal decay lingers.</comment>
