<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character development shows consistent motivation but lacks depth in psychological nuance; absent-mindedness drives actions but receives superficial treatment. Voice remains filtered through third-person narration without distinct individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structures itself around the chance encounter and door-knocking catalyst, but compressed arc sacrifices tension development; logical cause-effect links hold, though pacing unevenly balances atmospheric description with character progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting merges post-AI sterility with tactile anomalies; sensory details (resonant clang, synthetic humidity) immerse while contrasting artificial vs organic. Atmosphere directly mirrors protagonist's emotional state through environmental design.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery (brass knocker as 'roar' against machine hum) and symbolism in tactile authenticity elevate storytelling. Ending achieves emotional catharsis without sentimentality, though implied themes of human irreproducibility could probe deeper into philosophical territory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through specific details (holographic timetables "flickering like ghosts") but occasionally employs conventionally poetic language ("whisper of hope"). Metaphor density feels intentional rather than algorithmic, achieving atmospheric cohesion over verbal excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Elements serve thematic through-lines (kinesthizing bridges human/AI divides) with exception of underdeveloped Mira connection. Length works for elegiac tone, though character relationships and worldbuilding's lingering implications demand slower pacing.</comment>
