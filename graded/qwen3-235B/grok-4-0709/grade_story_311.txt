<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but relies too heavily on implanted loyalty trope without sufficient psychological depth; emotional resonance undercut by underexplored inner conflict</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Circular structure works but feels truncated; critical transitions (implant failure, rebellion arrival) rely on coincidence rather than earned progression</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong visual setup undermined by generic sensory details; lunar greenhouse's potential for thematic contrast with Earthly decay could be more fully realized</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolic elements (photo, greenhouse) but predictable emotional beats; "serene anger" conveyed more through labeling than embodied tension</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Neural implant control and rebellion tropes feel derivative; prose vacillates between undercooked metaphors and overwritten descriptions of rage</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>High-concept foundation handles elements competently but lacks distinctive voice; achieves basic cohesion but misses opportunities to create narrative electricity between components</comment>
