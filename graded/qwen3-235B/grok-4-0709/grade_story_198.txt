<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflict lacks depth; actions align with desperation but character feels more archetypal than fully formed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but pacing faltersâ€”key moments like thread-snapping feel rushed, weakening emotional payoff despite structural clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lavish descriptions evoke mood but lean on cliched mystical tropes; sensory details are vivid yet occasionally generic, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (wheel as parasite) elevates the narrative, but overreliance on adverbial intensifiers ("fragile ferocity") undercuts subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Creative metaphors clash with formulaic phrasing ("twisted mirror"); emotional beats are mostly shown but undercut by abstract descriptors like "shattering clouds."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements combine competently but lack inventive synergy; some forced connections (sun trails as guides) suggest a puzzle assembled from prompts rather than lived-in storytelling.</comment>
