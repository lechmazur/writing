<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Characters are archetypal but show effort in linking traits to plot; motivation feels imposed rather than organically revealed through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable puzzle-solving sequence; cause-effect logic strained by rapid resolution of complex mechanisms within limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambiance is vivid and atmospheric, though some sensory details verge on clich√©d (e.g., "flickering chandeliers"); the setting's duality of science/mysticism is compelling but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of synthesis and disclosure are present but underdeveloped; dialogue is stylized effectively, but emotional beats feel superficial despite strong imagery and metaphor use.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blends horror and science tropes well but relies on familiar dynamics (exorcist-skeptic pairing, hidden room reveals); subtext lacks depth to avoid feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Parses assigned elements efficiently but inconsistently weaves them into cohesive narrative logic; style is competent but lacks distinctive voice to elevate beyond competent genre fiction.</comment>
