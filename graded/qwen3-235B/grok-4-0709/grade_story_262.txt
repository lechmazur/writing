<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s alien motivation is clear but underexplored; her “righteously flawed” pushiness drives the plot but lacks nuance in how her extraterrestrial perspective shapes her decisions, reducing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Foreshadowing and resolution are uneven; the puzzle tile’s role in the climax feels tacked on, and the timeline across “weeks” of concerts strains pacing in the tight word limit, creating rushed emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting blends Roman architecture with modern lights, but sensory details (steamy air, stone echoes) are generic; the bathhouse’s rebirth mirrors Mia’s arc but lacks visceral, specific imagery to ground its symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The organ-as-metaphor for fear’s dissolution is poignant, and the ending’s theme of interconnectedness resonates, but emotional beats are occasionally stated (e.g., “fierce tenderness”) rather than felt through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Phrases like “reborn from ruins” and “fragile hearts” lean on clichés; the alien-teacher concept is original but overshadowed by predictable emotional arcs and over-explanation of themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements (alien, tile, bathhouse) are interwoven but inconsistently weighted; the resolution feels satisfying in isolation but lacks ambition for its lofty themes, prioritizing symbolism over visceral storytelling.</comment>
