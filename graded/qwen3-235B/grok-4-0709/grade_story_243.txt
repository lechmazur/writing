<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack nuance beyond initial portrayal; the fishhook's symbolic role is underdeveloped despite driving key actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot advances through exposition rather than organic tension; analytical resolution via mural drips feels contrived within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid pixelated atmosphere enhances tone, but inconsistent sensory immersion (e.g., absent sound descriptions despite chiptune sky).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors for code corruption are sharp but surface-level; themes lack transcendent emotional underpinning despite clever framework.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Original setting subverts tropes but contains predictable beats (corrupt hero, hidden mural); stylistic consistency outweighs mechanical clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive premise undermined by superficial resolution; elements serve plot but fail to create literary resonance beyond genre novelty.</comment>
