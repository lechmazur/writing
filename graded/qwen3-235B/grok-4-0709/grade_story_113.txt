<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bard's hesitance is consistent but lacks deeper psychological stakes; motivation to "unravel sorrow" feels abstractly assigned rather than organically connected to personal history with pandemic grief. Plush serves as functional symbol but doesn't fully reveal character complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dream-hopping lacks internal structural tension—cause/effect between character actions and dreamer transformations remain unearned. Opening's neon-lit decay doesn't sufficiently foreshadow clock tower's surreality. Too many narrative leaps in final chord's healing resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Xenon tunnels and decaying infrastructure create vivid yet generic decay; pandemic timeframe referenced rather than embodied. Clock tower's sorrow-as-dust metaphor works but misses opportunities to integrate tactile details—how does 2020's specific grief *feel* beyond melancholic imagery?</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphor density (tapestry, threads, veils) risks overwhelming emotional nuance. Final chord's thematic payoff feels earned through motif repetition rather than character transformation. Lingering question about time's fragility is undercut by abrupt "tatters" resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Post-pandemic trauma risks cliché through phrases like "frayed isolation." Dream machines follow predictable portal fantasy logic rather than innovating. "Shyly loud" remains underutilized in favor of heavy-handed irony. Dinosaur plush avoids trope through tactile details but insufficiently interrogated thematically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Element integration is competent but inconsistent—time's fragility could deepen through plush's worn state rather than serving purely symbolic. Narrative compression works for atmosphere but falters in emotional stakes. Closing chord resonates thematically but feels predetermined rather than organically earned.</comment>
