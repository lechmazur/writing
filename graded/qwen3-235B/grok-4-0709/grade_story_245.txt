<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character shows clear motivation through internal conflict and symbolic actions, but smuggler aspects feel underdeveloped; emotional depth is conveyed through memories rather than active trait embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end structure, but the tea leaf revelation feels abrupt; jogging as consistent action grounds momentum, though tight word count forces rushed thematic connections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative in visuals (rust, flickering lights) but lacks full sensory immersion; the setting mirrors internal decay but doesn't deepen character psychology or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "heart's revolt") and symbolic objects create emotional resonance; tea-leaf prophecy risks magical realism clichés, weakening logical cohesion despite poetic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids strict formula through sci-fi/tea ritual fusion; some phrases ("ghosts of forgotten departures") border on cliché, but the irate smuggler's introspective rebellion offers refreshing genre subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved, but elements occasionally strain credibility (tea leaves as maps); the spaceport setting and jogging framework could be more dynamically integrated rather than decorative.</comment>
