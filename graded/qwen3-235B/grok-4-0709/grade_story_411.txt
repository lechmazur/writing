<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth or growth; motivations feel abstract rather than humanely nuanced. The mechanical form doesn't actively deepen his role beyond surface symbolism. Repulsively attractive trait is atmospheric but underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as static ritual rather than progression. Fragment-studying action loops infinitely as prescribed by the infinity concept, but lacks narrative urgency or stakes. The beginning/end connection is circular, diminishing closure. Pacing feels inert within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting delivers vivid otherworldly imagery (glowing nebula-fruits, star-river) but spatial logic feels fragmented—how do the orchard's ecosystems interact with souls' fragments? Sensory details often ornate rather than thematically anchored. The infinite timeframe isn't visceral in the prose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (euphoric mourning, heart-as-mosaic) elevate impact. The exultant grief theme is intellectually provocative but lacks somatic character reactions to make it emotionally contagious. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks cathartic weight. Confessions-as-fragments idea is inventive yet underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Prose leans on lush adjectives/adverbs ("repulsively attractive," "forbidden knowledge") that occasionally dilute sincerity. Similes like "like forgotten dreams" over-explain. Mechanic's voice remains passive observer rather than actively compelling narrator. Fragment-studying method borders on poetic trope rather than fresh innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Highly atmospheric but thematically diffuse—elements coexist vividly yet lack narrative synergy. The brevity works against resolution of existential tensions. Lingering questions about infinity/sorrow feel intentional, but the story doesn't provide sufficient emotional footholds for reflection beyond aesthetic appreciation.</comment>
