<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Contrived internal struggles of Elias feel overwritten; motivations for returning wallet and interpreting plane seem engineered more than organically lived. Mira's gasp functions as a plot device rather than natural character response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Exposition-heavy progression undermines pacing; paper plane revelation arrives too conveniently to earn emotional impact. Plot coherence maintained through sheer stylistic force rather than organic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Beekeeper sanctuary rendered with lush sensory detail, but connection between apiary environment and narrative mechanics remains superficial. Atmospheric richness outpaces thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</comment>Imagery often overwhelms meaning; forced parallels between radio waves/planes/bees create conceptual clatter rather than resonance. Ending's symbolism feels more decorative than revealing of genuine human experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Perpetual use of compound adjectives ("ramshackle shed," "gravelly beacon") and conceptual oxymorons ("pompous humility") suggest mannered affectation over authentic voice. Emotional subtext feels telegraphed rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessively ornate prose obscures narrative precision; each assigned element operates as isolated trope rather than integrated narrative organ. Lingering impression of style masquerading as substance.</comment>
