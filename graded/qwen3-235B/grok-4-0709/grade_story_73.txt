<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character exhibits diligent whimsy through dirt sketches and ritual preservation, but motivation to maintain ancestral practices lacks emotional depth; confession about fading traditions remains superficial despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a ceremonial arc with clear beginning/middle/resolution, but temporal compression feels artificial; overlapping worlds emerge abruptly rather than organically unfolding within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Raunach-scented atmosphere and fusion temple/colonial setting use tactile contrasts effectively (ironwork/creepers), though sensory descriptions sometimes overpower narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal choreography and incantation innovations create memorable spectacle; theme of cultural continuity resonates, but emotional stakes remain atmospheric rather than viscerally urgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Blends Aztec colonial juxtaposition with ghostly convergence effectively, though overused oxymoronic phrasing ("raucous silence") and excessive adjectives border on purple prose; some ritual details feel anthropological rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but unevenly realized; combines elements with atmospheric success but struggles with emotional authenticity beneath stylistic flourishes.</comment>
