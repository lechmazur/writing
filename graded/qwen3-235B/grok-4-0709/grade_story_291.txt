<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Promises of complexity undercut by surface-level exploration of prejudice; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced self-reflection or contradictions. Voice occasionally relies on archaic flourishes over authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a distinct arc, but the cosmic echoes feel tacked onto the second half, weakening cause-and-effect logic. Pacing manages the word limit but strains in transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in the maze (rust, laughter, distortion) evoke mood, but the setting’s supernatural logic feels half-realized. The orchard cat timeframe is underutilized as atmospheric texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (mirrors as bias, rope as resilience) and thematic ambition are diluted by overwrought phrasing. The ending resolves the conflict but lacks lingering emotional weight beyond victory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids generic tropes in its metaphorical approach, though some phrases veer into flowery abstraction. Subtextual treatment of systemic bias through supernatural elements feels fresh, though execution occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but strain under scrutiny—cosmic echoes and orchard timing feel imposed rather than integral. The theme is clear but lacks layered exploration to fully justify its ambitious conceptual framework.</comment>
