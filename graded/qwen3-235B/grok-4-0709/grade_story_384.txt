<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Presentation of motivation feels stated rather than organically developed. The shift from seismologist to cook lacks psychological nuance. Actions align with stated goals but lack emotional depth or complexity in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Relies on contrived progression - decoding notches directly matching letters feels forced. Pacing issues: critical exposition condensed into brief passages. Story maintains a basic arc but lacks organic tension development within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through repetitive dust descriptions becomes numbing rather than immersive. Sensory details feel filtered through a limited vocabulary ("faintly beeping like heartbeat" falls flat). Time layers in setting aren't fully integrated with character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses pencil eraser and notches effectively as symbols of truth retrieval, but themes of manufactured fear remain superficially explored. Ending satisfies mechanical resolution but lacks emotional reverberation. Over-reliance on conceptual contrast ("serene frenzy") rather than earned impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept buried under overwrought phrasing. Tropes about conspiracies and secret knowledge exist but lack fresh subversion. Sensory details often default to "centuries of dust" repetition. Some striking phrases ("rubber etched with time") balanced by mechanical exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements crammed into artificial framework - the concept feels like a puzzle-solving exercise rather than organic storytelling. Short form reveals awkward compression: relationships between key components feel hastily explained. Lingering questions about seismic manipulation politics lack resolution.</comment>
