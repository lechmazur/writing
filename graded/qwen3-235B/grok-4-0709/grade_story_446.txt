<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation remains inconsistently realized; "peaceful anger" feels imposed rather than organically integrated through actions. Transformation lacks psychological nuance despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pacing collapses under word limit; key action (hydrolyzing ledger) feels narratively disconnected from charity drive framework. Structural coherence falters from over-stuffed symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on overwritten sensory details ("moist earth and dew-kissed flora") that verge on clich√©; setting serves to showcase metaphors rather than deepen the story's reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Petals/hydrolysis metaphors offer thematic depth; resolution shows character growth. Over-reliance on explicit emotional states ("serene fury") undermines subtlety. Central conflict remains interior but effectively concentrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Phrases like "glowing meadows" and "living stars" verge on stock imagery. Emotional subtext appears but often emerges through explained rather than felt moments. Subtlety struggles against decorative prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but awkwardly fused; word limit emphasizes disjunction between kingdom-restoration arc and environmental charity framework. Lacks transformative thematic urgency despite lyrical aspirations.</comment>
