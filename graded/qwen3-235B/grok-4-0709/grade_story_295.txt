<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's joviality vs. reluctant resolve feel superficial; motivations for ancestral vow and doubt-dethroning lack psychological depth despite surface gestures toward conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels truncated - celestial alignment drives action too conveniently, ritual lacks procedural logic, and transformation occurs without earned emotional buildup or satisfying causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Enchanted garden's sensory details enchant but occasionally overwhelm; atmosphere supports thematic chaos yet sometimes drifts into aesthetic excess without narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g. "whispering herbs") dazzles but prioritizes ornament over emotional nuance; theme of inherited legacy surfaces but isn't interrogated - transformation feels asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar fantasy tropes (witch + swordsman, celestial rituals); "elegant mayhem" phrasing borders on self-indulgent; character's doubt feels narratively imposed rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through recurring motifs (vow, transformation) but sacrifices focus - elements like time capsule function mechanically rather than symbolically; brevity highlights underdeveloped threads.</comment>
