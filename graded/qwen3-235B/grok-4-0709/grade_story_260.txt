<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but over-explained; actions align with traits yet lack psychological nuance beyond archetypal obsession</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from obsession to resolution but strains credibility through compressed causality (souls reconciling via crosswords); framework hinges on poetic logic over narrative mechanics</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting's tactile decay (yellowed pages, clinking brass) and ethereal ambiance (whisper symphony) create immersive friction between mortality and metaphysics</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical language (ink as "ink of the past") elevates theme, but emotional beats rely too heavily on explicit states ("yearning for peace") rather than earned subtext</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by clinical descriptions ("indefinitely absolute power") and repetitive abstraction; some sensory details (ethereal light bursts) border on clich√©</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Functional cohesion with striking set-pieces, but conceptual density overwhelms human-scale stakes; ambition exceeds emotional resonance</comment>
