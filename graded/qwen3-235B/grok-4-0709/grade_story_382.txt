<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's ranger background adds intriguing contrast to his literary quest but remains underexplored; motivation is clear but emotional depth feels surface-level despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed; the transition from discovery to implementation of workshops lacks emotional/psychological nuance; pacing stumbles in balancing atmospheric details with character action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering in the library's juxtaposition of caf√© vibrancy and ruined wing decay; atmosphere masterfully reinforces themes of renewal, though some similes border on excessive adornment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("red streak across gray sky") and paradoxical symbolism engage intellectually, but emotional impact is diluted by overly conceptual execution; ending feels conceptually sound but emotionally unearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elevated prose occasionally veers into baroque territory ("intellectual wilds"), but maintains cohesive tone; some phrases ("gleeful sorrow") work brilliantly, while others ("jagged skeletons") risk pretension; avoids major formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Competently integrates assigned elements with thematic ambition, but feels more like a polished concept draft than a fully realized narrative; symbolic connections are intelligible but lack visceral resonance.</comment>
