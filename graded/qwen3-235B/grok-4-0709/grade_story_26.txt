<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or reactions; sleep deprivation isn’t woven into the mechanics of his redemption or decision-making, reducing complexity and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing is controlled but cause-effect logic falters (DNA/radio/bell connection feels arbitrary); beginning and end align conceptually but lack narrative weight to fully satisfy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neon orchard and cyberpunk atmosphere create strong sensory immersion; however, the setting functions more as backdrop than an active force shaping character or plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Offers thematic depth on unity against shame via metaphor; prose sometimes over-explains emotions rather than showing, weakening impact on higher literary standards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attempts originality with DNA/radio fusion but occasionally defaults to overused motifs (relics, cyberpunk); tonal inconsistency between poetic language and emotional restraint hampers authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Impressive ambition and imagery undercut by inconsistent integration of elements—some core components feel detached from narrative logic, preventing full cohesion despite thematic intent.</comment>
