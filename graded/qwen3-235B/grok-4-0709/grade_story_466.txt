<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like cunning and moral ambiguity are mentioned but underdeveloped; motivations remain vague and inconsistently demonstrated through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is thin: the abrupt pivot to the tower, rushed decoding, and grocery-cart bookending feel more convenient than organically paced, undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (smoke, bread, crumbling tower) immerse the reader, but the juxtaposition of mundane and mystical elements lacks deeper thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor ("vessels for decoding the forgotten") are present but superficial; the ending attempts thematic resonance but feels underbaked rather than profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose veers into ornate description at times, but subverts some tropes (e.g., xerograph as theft substitute); moral ambiguity feels tacked on rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements feel stitched together rather than intertwined; brevity emphasizes undercooked ideas over depth, dampening lingering impact despite ambitious themes.</comment>
