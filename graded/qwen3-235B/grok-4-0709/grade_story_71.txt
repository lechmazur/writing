<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Consistent in concept but lacks internal stakes; character's apathy undermines tension, and the oath feels abstract rather than emotionally earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rigid VR/digital conflict structure struggles against the dreamlike setting; brevity forces plot to skip emotional beats needed for the climax to resonate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but overloaded; hallucinatory setting elements (time loops, shadow-light dissonance) create immersive disorientation, though tonal whiplash between tech and myth remains unresolved.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery dazzles (e.g., "pixels raining like ash") but lacks emotional gravity; the central metaphor of balance is clear but abstract, leaving thematic impact superficial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes surrealism with tech elements inventively, but over-reliance on esoteric descriptors ("burlap whispers") and the flatness of "fervent apathy" suggest algorithmic repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; elements work individually but never coalesce into transcendent commentary on oaths or reality-keeping.</comment>
