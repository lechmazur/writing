<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's boastfulness lacks depth, motivation for escape is clear but underdeveloped. Actions align with escape drive but reveal minimal internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear escape arc but relies heavily on exposition through soliloquies. Logical gaps in rewiring method undermine coherence within the tight structure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion marred by over-reliance on convenient plot devices (overheard soliloquies). Conceptual ambition evident but execution prioritizes style over organic integration.</comment>
