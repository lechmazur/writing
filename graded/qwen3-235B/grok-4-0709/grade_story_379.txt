<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (trickster, lawyer, preservationist) intermittently influence actions, but motivations lack layered emotional development; dialogue-free narrative prevents distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear trajectory (dareâ†’archive infiltration) but feels compressed; conceptual leaps (gift tag as archive key) strain coherence under tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dense sensory details (veins-like vines, artificial dawn) create immersive atmosphere; biodome setting meaningfully merges with theme of curated preservation vs. natural decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors ("spectral determination," "ghostly resolve") effectively mirror linguistic erasure theme; ending achieves thematic symmetry but lacks emotional gut-punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story avoids most AI-writing traps through unusual intersections (trickster/legal/linguistic elements) but sometimes descends into overwrought similes and uneven tone shifts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere in a conceptually satisfying way despite feeling engineered for thematic point-scoring rather than organic storytelling; elevated prose elevates thin plot.</comment>
