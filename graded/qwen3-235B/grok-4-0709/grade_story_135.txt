<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are stated more than demonstrated; dialogue absent, so voice remains abstract. Motivation is clear but tied to over-explained backstory rather than organic choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Predictable arc (solve clue → find community) unfolds through repetitive actions. Pacing strains coherence in short span; ending feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but internally inconsistent setting: geothermal vents vs. perpetual ice strain plausibility. Sensory details mesmerize but occasionally overwhelm narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., ale as language preservation) carry thematic weight. Emotional impact hindered by heavy-handed exposition; poetic prose elevates but cannot fully overcome structural flaws.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Nuanced themes buried under excessive ornamentation. Some fresh imagery (carnival poster bruises) undermined by clichéd "grandparent's wisdom" tropes and ornate language bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Successfully merges multiple elements but lacks tonal unity—technical jargon clashes with mystical undertones. Ambition evident but execution uneven, missing transcendent potential.</comment>
