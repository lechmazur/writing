<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's fading nature and motivation lack deeper integration; the enthusiastic apathy feels underexplored despite vividly rendered physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through hacking, but lacks narrative tension; the arc feels incomplete due to sparse development between setup and gorging on data.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered with sensory details (salty puddles, lavender scent), though some setting-character connections remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., "newborn galaxy") elevate the prose, but the ending's abruptness weakens thematic resonance and emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original imagery competes with overwritten descriptions; character logic occasionally feels forced (e.g., "enthusiastic apathy" underexploited in action).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric cohesion exists, but overemphasis on abstract metaphor weakens the storyâ€™s urgency; elements feel illustrative rather than functional.</comment>
