<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Patient guardian trait conflicts with rebellious actions; rationally mischievous lacks nuanced behavioral execution; motivation to unravel cosmic deception overshadows personal connection to brother; vivid dreamer quality underdeveloped through dialogue or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lunar path following effectively drives plot but causes rushed resolution; oscillation between realities structures progression yet sacrifices deeper cause-effect logic; tight word limit strains full arc development though circular tension between deception and apology anchors beginning/middle/end coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard's quartz-veined statues and moonlit fruit create haunting atmosphere; sensory details like ripening fruit's symbolic weight enrich setting; dour tone intentionally contrasts with mystical elements; cosmic scale occasionally flattens intimate details of environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors of cosmic puppeteering and memory-holding fruit create thematic resonance; oscillating between shadows as both method and existential state adds depth; requires active reader interpretation to unpack layered meaning; closing apology-as-weapon payoff emotionally resonant despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors ("dreams dancing like fireflies") border on cliche; subversion of "guardian" and "apology" tropes shows ingenuity; emotional beats often stated rather than demonstrated through action; atmospheric consistency triumphs over occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive mythopoeic system competes with character depth; assigned elements serve theme more than plot mechanics; compressed length paradoxically enhances dreamlike momentum while sacrificing emotional specificity; linguistic richness lingers more than narrative resolution.</comment>
