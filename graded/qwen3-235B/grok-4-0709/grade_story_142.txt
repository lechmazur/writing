<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack psychological depth beyond archetype; desperation to restore fortune is archetypally noble yet underexplored through backstory or internal conflict beyond surface-level longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Structured around a single decisive action with symbolic payoff, but compressed progression through the haunted setting feels perfunctory; spectral hill climax resolves conflict too easily without earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details—crumbling estate, spectral carnival lights—are vivid and thematically resonant; fog’s visual metaphor for blurred reality immerses effectively but occasionally overshadows plot clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Sets up legacy vs. reinvention tensions well; ending feels thematically resonant due to lyrical language and symbolic convergence, though emotional catharsis relies heavily on poetic abstraction over earned character growth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Over-reliance on archaic descriptors ("groaning vines," "spectral wails") teeters into gothic cliché; some metaphors (e.g., watercolor imagery) succeed, but emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown through nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Uses assigned elements cohesively for mood-piece purposes, but thematic ambition occasionally outpaces narrative brevity; lingering questions about intergenerational guilt persist, yet character transformation feels abbreviated.</comment>
