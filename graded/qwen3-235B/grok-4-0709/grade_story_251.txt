<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak integration of abstract traits into behavioral consistency; internal conflict relies heavily on stated contradictions rather than demonstrated psychological complexity. The prophet's actions occasionally contradict his established ambivalence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High-concept metaphor-driven resolution strains plausibility; structural coherence dependent on fantastical logic rather than organic plot progression. Transitions between action sequences feel overly condensed, sacrificing tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lunar mining colony established through generic technical descriptors; underutilized potential for atmospheric tension between industrial reality and mystical elements. Sensory details remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent metaphoric scaffolding (marbles, puzzles, cosmic scorekeeping) elevates thematic resonance. Emotional impact diluted by overreliance on abstract conceptualization rather than visceral character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through poetic sci-fi fusion but occasionally collapses into opaque abstraction. Some overwritten metaphors and conceptual shortcuts persist, particularly in temporal mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion achieved despite ambitious thematic layering; brevity occasionally undermines emotional payoff. Subversive approach to prophetic narrative and deterministic fate offers intellectual stimulation but feels slightly glib.</comment>
