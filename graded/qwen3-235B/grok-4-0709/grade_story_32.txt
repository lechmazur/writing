<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weakly developed beyond thematic function; motivation is clear but character lacks emotional depth beyond archetypal "tormented hero" clich√©s</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious with thematic cohesion, but tighter execution and emotional specificity would elevate market-readiness</comment>
