<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are atmospheric but underdeveloped; Elias's fear and Alex's complicity lack psychological depth. The "carefully careless" duality is conceptually intriguing but remains performative rather than psychologically rooted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plots rely on contrived synchronicity (blood drives, haunted mansions) with insufficient causal logic. Pacing creates a compressed but disjointed arc; the 500-word constraint exacerbates narrative fragmentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering: the "vein-pulsing vine," the "crimson life" of blood, and oppressive silence create immersive dread. Timeframe and setting fuse into a liminal space that amplifies psychological unease.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s through botanical grotesquerie, but the haunted mansion framework and "silent pact" trope remain predictably archetypal. Some over-reliance on gothic conventions (cracked windows, phantom banquets) dilutes originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion exists superficially but lacks thematic sophistication. The brevity both heightens tension and exposes structural gaps (underdeveloped blood donation connection), leaving emotional resonance uneven.</comment>
