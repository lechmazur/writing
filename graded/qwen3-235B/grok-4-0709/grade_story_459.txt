<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation rooted in guilt and loss, with actions consistent with traits; however, secondary characters and ghostly figures lack development, limiting emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lean but coherent structure with a resolved arc; pacing occasionally sacrifices nuance, particularly in the lab scenes, but the thematic closure is satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative, eerie atmosphere with sensory details (e.g., "sand holding its breath"), though the lab’s surreal specifics feel underexploited relative to thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (sand, silence, dissection), a poignant theme, and subtle "showing" elevate the impact, though the brevity slightly limits emotional immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise and avoiding clichés in ghostly closure; some phrasing ("whispers of ghosts") verges on familiar, but metaphors are largely inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poignant whole; the brevity enhances focus, and the theme resonates, though deeper exploration of the lab’s significance could strengthen cohesion.</comment>
