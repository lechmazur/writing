<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation ties to abandonment/healing, but emotional shifts feel rushed. Dialogue lacks subtext, with sardonic glee often veering into caricature. Voice remains consistent but not deeply nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ritual structure with cause-effect logic. Pacing manages to convey arc within constraints, but the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Temporal compression works but lacks tension escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust motes, creaky floorboards) create a haunting atmosphere. The static room contrasts with dynamic internal conflict effectively, though some descriptions border on excessive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through metaphor (heartbeat as healing) and generational trauma theme. Dialogue-heavy resolution leans on exposition but avoids outright sentimentality. Subtext about abandonment feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vibrant imagery (dragonfly wings, storm-tossed ship) elevates originality, but tone occasionally slips into melodrama. Some phrases ("whispers of forgotten dreams") risk clich√©. Emotional shifts feel logical but lack visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Gel cohesive conceptually but execution falters under brevity constraints. The final transformation feels earned yet superficial. Elements serve the narrative technically but lack narrative ambition for elite publication.</comment>
