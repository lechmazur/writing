<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's muteness creates unique voice projection through Whisper, but motivation to archive weather as emotional cartography lacks deep psychological grounding. Personality influences method (ventriloquism) but remains more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overheard calls drive plot but create artificial momentum through coincidental eavesdropping. Pacing jerks between scenes; emotional arc condensed to abstraction. Causal links between weather-archiving and family redefinition feel conceptually blurred rather than earned through character action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid but disjointed worldbuilding: reverse waves and interdimensional phones dazzle visually but don't pressure the narrative. Ethereal glows lack tactile specificity; atmosphere reflects emotional weather motif but doesn't deepen it. Sensory overload occasionally distracts from thematic core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden approach (storms as familial bonds) creates intellectual resonance, but emotional impact diluted by abstraction. Ending's "hopeful connections" aims for transcendence but rings somewhat hollow without earned catharsis. Subtext present, execution uneven in balancing show/tell.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original concept weakened by stylized overreaching. Overuse of terms like "agitation" and "euphoric" borders on incantation rather than lived experience. Some fresh metaphors (weather as emotional cartography) but undercut by rhythmic repetition that risks poetic hollowness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic layering (science, family, silence) exists in tension with cramped execution. Assigned elements are cleverly connected but create narrative friction; brevity prioritizes concept over character investment. Lingering thought exists (weather as universal connector) but feels aspirational rather than fully developed.</comment>
