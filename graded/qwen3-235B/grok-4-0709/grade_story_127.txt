<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but emotionally underdeveloped; Elias's guilt and redemption arc feel rushed, with insufficient nuance in his internal conflict or relationship with Victor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but sacrifices cohesion for symbolism; flashbacks intrude abruptly, and the resolution feels contrived rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but superficial; the steampunk setting evokes imagery without meaningful interaction with character or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., coral-gauntlet symbolism) add depth, but emotional resonance is diluted by passive character interactions and a pat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (exiled knight, guilt-driven redemption); excessive ornate description overshadows psychological complexity and risks pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; steampunk motifs and the coral’s role feel decorative rather than essential to the narrative’s emotional core.</comment>
