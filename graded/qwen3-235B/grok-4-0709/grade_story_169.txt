<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation: Elias' desire to learn forgotten songs drives the plot but isn't fully integrated with his occupation - his personal passion feels appended rather than organically connected to his soul-brokering profession. Lira's character exists primarily as a passive receptacle for Elias' persuasion techniques rather than a fully realized entity, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragmented structure: Effective opening but stumbles in middle as choreography sequence lacks emotional stakes. The reversed label method remains logically consistent yet feels like narrative convenience rather than organic plot mechanism. Resolution ties too neatly to the "recycling" timeframe, creating artificial neatness rather than earned coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transportive atmosphere: The floating tea platform's paradoxical static existence against cosmic recycling creates vivid tension. Sensory details (tea's memory flavor, twilight permanence) and spatial imagery (chaos vs. order) establish concrete otherworldliness. Atmospheric consistency maintained through deliberate physical contradictions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Surface-thematic dissonance: The surface theme of "home as transient permanence" lacks emotional resonance. Metaphors (reversed labels for forgotten potential) undercut by explicit explanations. Ending satisfies plot mechanics but fails to explore deeper questions about cyclical existence or ethical persuasion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uneven originality: Striking concepts (tea tasting of memories) diluted by over-ornamented phrases ("whispered symphony"). Some imagery ("cosmic ballet") feels like aesthetic window dressing rather than psychologically grounded invention. Transitions between cosmic scale and intimate persuasion lack tonal cohesion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented integration: Overloaded with assigned elements that frequently compete with narrative flow. Conceptual scaffolding visible beneath surface, creating mechanical feel despite lyrical prose. The soul-broking conceit feels more arch than meaningful, leaving thematic residue rather than emotional imprint.</comment>
