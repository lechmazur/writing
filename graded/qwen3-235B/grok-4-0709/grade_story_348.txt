<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's humility is present but underdeveloped; somnambulist trait informs plot but lacks psychological depth; motivation to map spiritual wisdom is clear but repetitive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves cohesively but lacks tension; pilgrimage and discovery of journals drive narrative, but timeframe "between flights" remains underutilized thematically.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pervasive sensory details (moss, hum, bioluminescence) masterfully evoke eerie, overgrown decay; atmosphere aligns with mystical-humble tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("woodland's veins," "constellations of the soul") and ethereal imagery elevate it; theme of reconciliation with ancestral past resonates, though subtext feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative elements (bottled lightning bugs, sunken lab) avoid formulaicity, but pilgrimage setup and "hidden sins" hint at predictable tropes; language occasionally becomes ornate without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively yet mechanically; each assigned piece is used, but some (timeframe) feel logistical rather than thematic; haunting atmosphere lingers more than narrative stakes.</comment>
