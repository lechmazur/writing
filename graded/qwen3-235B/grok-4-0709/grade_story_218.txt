<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but emotional depth remains surface-level; internal conflict is stated rather than embodied through actions, reducing psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structurally cohesive with thematic bookending, but the abrupt transition from improv show to carnival weakens narrative momentum within the constrained word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Irregular balance between poetic flourishes and narrative urgency; character transformations lack subtlety, while sensory descriptions occasionally veer into self-conscious ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thematic ambition and metaphorical scaffolding suggest literary potential, but uneven execution in pacing and emotional nuance prevent full realization of its aspirations.</comment>
