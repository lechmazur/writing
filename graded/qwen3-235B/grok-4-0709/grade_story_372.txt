<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is defined by lovelorn trait but lacks nuanced emotional depth; motivations mentioned but not organically demonstrated through actions. "Gloat" at end feels inconsistent with established melancholic voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear beginning/middle/end but feels compressed; inciting incident (synth-food tasting) oddly abrupt. Pacing balances action/emotion but lacks gradual tension development within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative cyberpunk imagery (bioluminescent vines, neon haze) creates immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance emotional tone but setting doesn't actively shape character decisions beyond providing backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("heart as circuit board") and symbolic objects elevate storytelling. Ending resonates thematically but emotional impact diluted by frequent abstractions rather than grounded character behavior.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Original setting concepts diluted by genre clich√©s (dystopian slums, betraying agency). Some fresh metaphors but emotional beats feel algorithmic (e.g., "avalanche of regret") rather than organically earned.</comment>
