<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bruno's dual nature as "docile bruiser" is visually consistent but lacks psychological depth; his motivation to "mold a myth from the mud" is conceptually clear but emotionally underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has directional clarity (map → baton → revelation) but strained pacing; drum solos as atmospheric motif never fully integrate into narrative causality; myth-revelation climax feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Greenhouse labyrinth achieves hallucinatory cohesion through precise sensory details (twisted vines, acidic plant scents); sonic contrast between devouring plants and drum solos heightens tension; setting actively generates thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Batons-as-resurrection-tool subversion delivers philosophical weight; "brash tenderness" manifests in both Bruno's plant-handling and map-puzzling; ending achieves mythic resonance through metaphor over spectacle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Excessive visual metaphor density bordering on purple prose ("vines whispered in a tongue of rustles"); language barriers exist as surface-level conceit rather than structural innovation; concept-to-cliché ratio leans problematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Impressive tonal synthesis of violence and delicacy amidst tight constraints; some elements (drum solos, foreign workers) feel externally imposed rather than organically integrated into 498-word canvas.</comment>
