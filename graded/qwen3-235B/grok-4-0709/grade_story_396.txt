<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Characters serve plot functions but lack depth; Theo's forgetfulness is surface-level, Dr. Voss remains a caricature of scientific rigidity. Motivations are clear but insufficiently nuanced to justify their ideological clash within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from rushed resolution; the science fair setting provides structural scaffolding but strains credibility through condensed interactions. The central negotiation feels artificially tidied despite solid causality in smaller beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Parisian champagne vault delivers rich sensory atmosphere with holograms vs. stained-glass imagery, though its symbolic potential remains underexploited beyond aesthetic contrast. The setting vividly frames conflict but doesn't deepen it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (preservation vs. progress) emerges, undercut by predictable resolution. Dialogue sharpens thematic stakes but lacks haunting resonance; holographic champagne as climax feels slightly contrived rather than thematically inevitable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Concept avoids complete clich√© through genre fusion (science fair theater) but includes overfamiliar binaries. Some purple prose ("whisper from Paris's soul") and underdeveloped subtext, though the tactile/scientific tension shows flashes of originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story effectively deploys assigned elements but prioritizes checklist fulfillment over organic integration; the science fair as both method and setting creates structural strain. Lingering questions about preservation modes lack sufficient narrative weight.</comment>
