<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorne's traits (amiable, intellectual defiance) are consistent but lack complexity or evolution. His motivation is clear but remains abstract rather than manifesting through tangible personal stakes or setbacks.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vibrant imagery distracts from weak plot infrastructure. The signal's arrival lacks emotional payoff, and the crossword's symbolic role remains undercooked. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in the lighthouse's decay and supernatural creaking timbers. However, the setting feels decorative rather than integral - the haunting could occur anywhere and retain the same impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "doubly singular" and the lighthouse as liminal space elevate the narrative. Emotional undercurrents remain surface-level; the theme of bridging eras lacks visceral urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Imagery veers toward overwrought gothic clich√©s ("shadows danced like forgotten secrets"). The crosswords-as-metaphor concept is original but execution defaults to abstract lecturing rather than concrete storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gorgeous fragments masquerading as a full story. The elements superficially connect but lack the tight interdependence that would elevate the narrative into transcendent territory despite the word limit.</comment>
