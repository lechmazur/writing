<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks visceral interiority to sell his trauma; motivations are stated but under-explored emotionally. The transformation feels unearned despite clear plot markers of change. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot machinery too overt (misplaced letter, conveniently found spectacles). Resolution ties together but feels concept-driven rather than character-earned. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stylized descriptions overwhelm atmosphere—cliches about cherry blossoms and "weathered stone" create a generic Japaneseness rather than specific cultural texture. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor of mosaics as healing works beautifully. The ending's symbolic resonance ("seeds taking root") is undercut by earlier telling rather than showing of emotional shifts. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on abstract phrases like "corroded rapture" verges on purple prose. The former lawman's voice feels anachronistic and inconsistent with minimal dialogue to ground it. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists—the elements theoretically tie together—but execution lacks the raw, human-specific details that would make it feel essential rather than just cleverly constructed. </comment>
