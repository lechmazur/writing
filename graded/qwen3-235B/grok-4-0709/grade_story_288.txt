<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters possess surface-level traits but lack depth; Elias's motivation to teach "freedom's cost" feels didactic rather than organically integrated through subtext or nuanced action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Quarantine provides clear structure, but tight word limits force rushed progression between key moments (forging, holographic simulation). Resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere collapses under relentless sensory overload; descriptions ("ozone monitoring station," "toxic lagoon") prioritize aesthetic over functional engagement with the setting's logic or rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (flag â†’ sculpture) and paradoxes (audacious meekness) create layered subtext. Ending intertwines theme and image with resonant, enduring clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Original combinations (e.g., stand-up paddleboarding in toxic lagoon) surprise effectively. Minimal purple prose; emotional restraint in describing Lila's fear elevates this above AI-generic work.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements strain narrative cohesion; "professionally wild" feels like a checklist tag applied to two characters rather than a thematic throughline.</comment>
