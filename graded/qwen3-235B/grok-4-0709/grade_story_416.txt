<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters display clear traits (Eldric's stoicism vs. Mira's exuberance), but motivations lack psychological depth, relying on stock tropes rather than nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function efficiently within constraints, but the resolution feels abrupt and the compressed arc sacrifices emotional weight for structural expediency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions (glowing fungi, floating stalls) establish mood, but the setting remains decorative rather than shaping character decisions or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and concept payoff impress, but surface-level themes (destiny vs. chance) and "showing" through cinematic gestures rather than profound emotional truth limit impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Attempts freshness with fossilized oracle-shell imagery clash with generic knight-scholar dynamic; "phosphorescent fungi" and "swamp's heartbeat" verge on clich√©; emotional beats signaled rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Competent execution with marketable hooks, but derivative elements and underdeveloped ideas prevent transcending competent genre expectations for elite publication.</comment>
