<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "carefully reckless" and "shaky" are stated but underexplored in actions; emotional depth relies on exposition over shown realization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on plot-convenient visions to resolve conflict; transitions between scenes are abrupt, pacing uneven in tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes decay and art effectively but lacks vivid sensory details; the cathedral’s symbolism aligns with themes yet feels superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like the trapped spider deepen theme; emotional resonance is diluted by predictable redemption arc and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on genre clichés (haunted mercenary, redemptive artifact); overly ornate phrasing and simplistic emotional cues suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but loosely woven; some creative pairings (cathedral/street art) juxtapose well, but cohesion and narrative impact are weakened by predictable structure.</comment>
