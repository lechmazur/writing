<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits like "naively earnest" are explicitly stated but under-demonstrated; motivation (escaping misfortune) lacks psychological depth despite surface-level consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Predictable arc of discovery overshadows underdeveloped tension; the wind chimes-as-map mechanic feels contrived yet marginally logical within the world's mysticism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive through deliberate sensory contrasts (dust motes, wind chime sounds), though the swing’s symbolic resonance remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates mood over substance; metaphors ("tarnished relics hinting at glory") work harder than character choices to convey theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stylized but derivative—puppet workshops and cursed explorers tread familiar ground; atmospheric details occasionally border on self-consciously ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Competently tight structure within constraints; themes of "discovery through chaos" resonate mildly but lack transcendent emotional stakes.</comment>
