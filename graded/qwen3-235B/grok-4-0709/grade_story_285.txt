<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Awkwardness is stated but underexplored; motivation is clear but lacks personal stakes. His 'emergence' aligns with hermit crab metaphor but doesn't organically stem from his clumsiness. No distinct voice weakens internalization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tight structure but underdeveloped cause/effect. Hermit-crab method feels conceptually imposed rather than integral to plot logic. Arc resolved too abruptly; pacing strains coherence in bridging exposition to action sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid physical details dominate over emotional resonance. Tundra/orchard/vents create striking atmosphere but tenuously connect to central mechanics (postcard, bridging). Tonal dissonance between rancor and resolution weakens thematic unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hermit-crab metaphor shows ingenuity, but emotional impact diluted by exposition-heavy delivery. Ending lacks visceral satisfaction despite clever symbolism. Effective imagery (steam-as-ghosts) contrasts with overly direct thematic statements about tradition vs. sorcery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original use of biological metaphor avoids fantasy tropes but strains credibility through insufficient worldbuilding. Some flowery phrasing ("ephemeral rancor") distracts; emotional beats rely on abstract description rather than subtext. Sensory details lean generic despite vivid setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist without symbiosisâ€”the postcard/hermit crab linkage feels imposed rather than organic. Brief scope is leveraged but resolution feels perfunctory. Unique premise lacks follow-through on philosophical implications of "shell-shedding" transformations.</comment>
