<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are symbolic but inconsistently explored; Elias's agency feels constrained by thematic intent while Mira's interiority remains underdeveloped, creating uneven emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but sacrifices believability for metaphor; the forge discovery feels convenient rather than earned through organic progression, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (ventilation shaft whispers, holographic stars) enhance thematic tension; however, worldbuilding inconsistencies (black-market neural implants in pediatric ward) undermine immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective symbolism elevates thematic resonance, particularly through dragonfly motif; however, the didactic conversation between characters strains emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attempts conceptual subversion but relies on genre conventions (dying mentor trope, cybernetic underground); "edgy nostalgia" sometimes substitutes for genuine emotional exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution reveals structural compromises; the ending satisfies thematic goals more than emotional stakes, leaving character arcs partially realized within strict constraints.</comment>
