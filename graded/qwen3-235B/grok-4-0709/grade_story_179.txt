<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but lacks psychological complexity; the watchman's envy of the queen feels underdeveloped compared to the intricate setting, with emotional contradictions stated more than shown through grounded behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot strains under its own ambition - the fingerprint code feels like a contrivance, the coloring session framework doesn't fully justify the narrative arc, and the ending's emotional resonance remains underpowered within the constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imaginative worldbuilding elevates the piece; the humming hive's sensory details create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that meaningfully interacts with character psychology through visual color symbolism and auditory motifs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphorical language impress ("veins of forgotten battles"), but thematic depth about envy vs. duty gets overshadowed by occasionally strained symbolism and explicit emotional declarations rather than organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The writing shows flashes of originality but contains overwrought descriptions ("jubilant remorse"), inconsistent metaphoric logic, and psychological simplifications that suggest algorithmic generation despite its ambitious premises.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The story impresses with its conceptual boldness and atmospheric quality but struggles with narrative cohesion and emotional precision, leaving its ambitious thematic framework frustratingly under-realized within the tight constraints.</comment>
