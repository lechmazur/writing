<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but thinly developed; her connection to the button and lament lacks emotional depth beyond archetypal rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels truncated; transitions between lament and revelation are abrupt, undermining coherence within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly imagined with vivid sensory details, but the mechanical logic of "between channels" and its ties to the plot remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like the flag’s ripple echoing soul connections are poignant, but emotional impact is diluted by overly abstract imagery and a pat resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally overwritten; some phrases (“sharp gentleness”) feel forced, and emotional stakes lack nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but unevenly executed; elements work in tandem yet lack the narrative density required for high-tier literary publication.</comment>
