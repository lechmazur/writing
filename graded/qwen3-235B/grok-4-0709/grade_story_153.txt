<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear (immortality, control), but internal conflict and emotional nuance remain underdeveloped; interactions with mole people rely on abstract detachment rather than concrete gestures, weakening psychological resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually sound, but the transition to digitization via journals feels contrived; pacing is streamlined but lacks tension between technical process and existential stakes, leaving the resolution emotionally inert despite clever conceptual scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, salt chamber, echoing whispers) create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere; tone of detached devotion aligns with the bleakly philosophical themes, though the post-stellar timeframe’s implications feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Digital transcendence metaphor and "mundanely glorious" headlamp imagery offer intellectual heft; ending leans too heavily on abstract closure, weakening its emotional resonance despite precise, poetic prose and layered motif use.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on underdeveloped AI-esque phrasing ("gifted burden," "echoing whispers"); emotional subtext is implied through setting more than character, though metaphors feel specific, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements but uneven integration—particularly the journals—reveals patchwork seams; narrative compression works except for the rushed neural network climax; conceptual ambition outweighs emotional payoff.</comment>
