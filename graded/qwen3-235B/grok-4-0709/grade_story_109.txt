<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's coldness and rebelliousness are shown through actions, but the artistic awakening feels abrupt and underdeveloped. Motivation to collect remedies is consistent, but emotional shift via the mitten lacks layered psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc from patrol to mitten to artistic resolve is clear, but the transformation's causality feels condensed. Pacing manages the word limit well but lacks nuanced progression between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid fog, flickering light, and icy metaphors. Setting serves theme (oppression vs. hidden resilience), though secret agent center's blend with folk elements strains verisimilitude.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through symbolism (mittens as art-healing metaphor) and restrained imagery. Some ideas (e.g., "armored soul") are over-explained, undercutting subtler metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction ("whispers of forgotten legacies"). The core metaphor (art as rebellion) feels human but could deepen emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Story coheres despite multifaceted elements. While the secret agent/altars juxtaposition strains logic, the integration of folk remedies, art, and rebellion suggests intentional thematics with minor tonal friction.</comment>
