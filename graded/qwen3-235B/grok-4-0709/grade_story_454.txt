<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dreams of depth but settles for surface-level symbolism. The clover and Lena's role gesture at emotional complexity but never fully merge with Jax's actions. Motivation for seeking acceptance feels underexplored despite surface clarity, relying more on poetic description than psychological plausibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum stalls between stylized descriptions and schematic syncopation of alarms. The torn map's symbolic weight strains against the lack of tangible plot progression. Coincidences (perfectly timed hacks) undermine narrative credibility despite clever conceptual framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Haunted elements recycle familiar carnival tropes without reinvention. Sensory details (creaking, moonlight) lack specificity to make the environment unforgettable. Atmospheric attempts drown in excessive personification ("funhouse groaning like alive") that feels performative rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance undermined by heavy-handed metaphorization - four-leaf clovers as heartbeat? Too many layers of "meaning" without earned gravitas. Repetition of "jubilant despair" motif risks becoming thematic crutch rather than nuanced emotional palette.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Over-reliance on familiar genre scaffolding: haunted houses, smugglers, digital companionship. Synchronized alarms feel contrived to force connection. Excessive adjectives ("warped funhouse mirrors peeking", "jubilant curse") tip into purple prose. Emotional states are both shown and told awkwardly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Competent assembly of required elements but lacks transcendent vision. Story exists in uneasy balance between noir thriller and supernatural heist, never fully committing to either. The ending merely pauses rather than resolves. Technical proficiency present but no seismic impact.</comment>
