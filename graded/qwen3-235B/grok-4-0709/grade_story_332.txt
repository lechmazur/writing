<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is emotionally consistent but lacks complexity; motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond grief and love.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable redemption arc; pacing is rushed in the middle, undermining emotional weight of the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting with rich sensory details; the exo-atmospheric garden is flawlessly realized but occasionally overshadows character depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and poetic imagery enhance the theme, but the narrative leans too heavily on "telling" emotions rather than showing nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original in concept but undermined by overly ornate prose and occasional clich√©s (e.g., "borrowed books" trope); emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are often disjointed; some (e.g., "stage curtains" metaphor) feel contrived. The ending provokes reflection but lacks narrative cohesion.</comment>
