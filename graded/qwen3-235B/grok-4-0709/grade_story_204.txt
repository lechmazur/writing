<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist’s transformation feels abrupt and insufficiently earned despite strong conceptual anchors like the ticket punch confrontation revealing her bias.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Pacing suits the word limit but relies on contrived setup-to-symbol-to-resolution beats; the decaying object’s symbolic link to prejudice is effective but the emotional arc lacks gradual tension or organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (scent of bread, rusted rocket husks) create a vivid atmosphere of decay-meets-renewal; however, the setting occasionally overwhelms the narrative with ornate accumulation of imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (decaying object as prejudice transformation) are evocative but verge on didacticism; subtext about embracing old/new duality is present yet could avoid explicit reinforcement through dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Phrases like “unusually usual” feel engineered for conceptual symmetry; emotional beats lean on explicit declarations (“she realized”) rather than nuanced character interiority or subtextual layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven; their integration lacks cohesive organicity. The brevity works structurally but prioritizes concept over emotional resonance.</comment>
