<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but relies on exposition-heavy backstory; actions align with guilt-driven quest yet emotional depth is undercut by over-explanation of feelings rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a contained arc (decoding blanket → emotional release), but pacing feels slightly rushed due to word limits; the sunken setting and decoding method drive momentum but resolution lacks narrative consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with vivid, original sensory details (coffee steaming underwater via "custom gear," spectral pirates); tone of haunted beauty complements themes of guilt and reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story conveys emotional weight through tactile metaphors (ring, blanket) and symbolic setting; ending achieves closure but lacks subtext or lingering ambiguity, leaning on familiar redemption tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unique elements (encoded blanket, coffee in deep sea) show creativity but some tropes (haunted relics, "manic genius") feel overfamiliar; emotional beats are mostly explicit rather than layered through subtext or action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story integrates required elements but unevenly—wilderness guide trait feels superficial, decoding premise is original yet strained; themes of guilt and healing are poignant but lack philosophical depth.</comment>
