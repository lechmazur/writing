<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterization relies on vivid but surface-level imagery; Elias' motivation to understand cosmic patterns is clear but underdeveloped in lived context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a meditative arc but feels compressed; the riddle-action drives cohesion yet resolution lacks tangible stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (graveyard, tangled vines, seasonal liminality) but occasionally oversaturated with adjective-heavy descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Meticulous symbolism (knots, markets, stars) elevates thematic depth; the revelation risks abstraction but lingers as a haunting metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in cosmic-market fusion, but cyclical metaphors and storm similes occasionally border on clich√©; tone remains consistent but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated with intention, though the tight focus on metaphysics leaves some motifs (e.g., "between seasons") underexploited for narrative propulsion.</comment>
