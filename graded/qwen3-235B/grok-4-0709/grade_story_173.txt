<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character development is hindered by abstract descriptors over concrete actions; "trustworthy unique" feels unearned, and emotional depth remains surface-level despite poetic backstory references.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but unevenly paced; the inciting incident (faded leaves) and resolution (phantom hand method) are conceptually tight but lack dramatized tension or obstacles.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting immersion is strong via vivid aquatic details and multiverse hints, but atmospheric elements occasionally veer into decorative excess without fully integrating with Elias's emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and thematic contrasts (loss/renewal, memory/tangible action) create resonance; some emotional beats feel overly abstract but imagery elevates the whole.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional generic metaphors ("bubbles like ascending souls") and slightly mechanical phrasing in transition ("Tears mingled with seawater..."); retains haunting core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but occasionally feel checklist-driven; the multiverse and underwater setting amplify atmosphere but aren't fully leveraged to deepen thematic stakes.</comment>
