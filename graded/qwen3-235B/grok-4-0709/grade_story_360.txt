<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (meekness, sincerity) influence actions (e.g., quiet reflection), but motivations and reactions lack depth. His sudden realization feels disconnected from earlier doubts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within word limits, but pacing falters in middle sections. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, playground sounds) create atmosphere, but setting-character connection feels inconsistent. Goblin city's role remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Purposeful imagery and theme of embracing chaos as order stand out, but emotional resonance remains surface-level. Final paragraph lacks narrative impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes in setting (goblin city), but redemption arc feels formulaic. Some purple prose ("laughter mimicked drip of distant water") detracts from authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combined cohesively with effective symbolism, but ending lacks narrative weight. Conceptual depth exists without achieving lasting resonance.</comment>
