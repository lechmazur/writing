<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Monk's stubbornness drives action but lacks emotional texture; internal conflict with dark reflection remains abstract rather than viscerally embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Core elements (flute, gondola) are integral, but some connections (shipping label's sender) feel mechanically plot-driven rather than thematically resonant.</comment>
