<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivation is consistent but lacks psychological complexity or evolution beyond grief-to-hope arc</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements create cohesive thematic skeleton; specific combinations (Polaroids in sky-lounge, mapping endless night) show creativity; some components feel decorative rather than essential</comment>
