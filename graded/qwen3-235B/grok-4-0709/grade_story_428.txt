<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation feels mostly externalized, with sudden realization lacking sufficient psychological grounding; transformation lacks emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tight structure but pacing suffers from compressed epiphany; cause-effect logic between constellation study and decision feels artificially imposed rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details excel in temple atmosphere, but "daring caution" tone remains abstract rather than being embodied through character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (ink blotter as liberation tool) contrast with overwrought symbolism; ending feels more conceptually neat than emotionally truthful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive "debase"/"authenticity" phrasing; over-reliance on antithetical binaries (order/chaos, control/freedom) suggests algorithmic pattern recognition rather than organic thematic development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmospheric successes outweigh inconsistent thematic integration; story's attempt to merge urban planning and spiritual liberation lacks full narrative cohesion.</comment>
