<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are described but not deeply demonstrated; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced conflict or growth against assigned elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot arcs from discovery to revelation, but pacing feels compressed; cause/effect between elements (sundial, letter, rebellion) is underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers, but the setting’s decay is more symbolic than active in driving narrative; atmospheric consistency slightly uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphorical language elevate tone, but emotional resonance relies on exposition over subtext; themes are explicit rather than woven into action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Linguistic flourishes verge on purple prose; some tropes (e.g., whispering ivy, mystical seals) feel under-interrogated; metaphors lean on familiar imagery rather than innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</comment><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally strain credibility; thematic ties between rebellion, memory, and the station’s decay are promising but unevenly realized.</comment>
