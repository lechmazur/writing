<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "unassuming" nature is asserted but not deeply demonstrated through actions; the "lethargically energetic" trait often reads as contradictory rather than complex; motivation to "cradle wisdom" lacks visceral connection to concrete goals beyond abstract yearning</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear progression from discovery to revelation, but the emotional payoff feels rushed; the puzzle box's symbolic function is effective, yet the transformation from lethargy to resolve lacks sufficient narrative weight within the compressed scope</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting descriptions (corrosive dew, acid rain) clash with inconsistent logic (feather's preservation); atmosphere leans on Gothic clich√©s rather than exploring unique intersections between setting and character consciousness</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("choices mapped on feather barbs") elevate the narrative, but over-reliance on abstract concepts (ember of choice) undercuts visceral impact; theme of rebirth from decay remains underinterrogated</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some striking imagery competes with overwritten passages ("lazily energetic gait, prickly wonder"); the feather's symbolic function feels human-crafted, but the post-apocalyptic framework leans too heavily on familiar tropes without subversion</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements gel in service of melancholic allegory but lack integration; the feather's revelation feels algorithmically convenient rather than organically earned; atmosphere lingers, but thematic resonance remains diffuse</comment>
