<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underexplored; Elias's eccentricity shapes his role but lacks nuanced internal conflict. Mira's arc is underdeveloped despite promising setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is generally coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels occasionally rushed, particularly in Mira's character development. The pruning action drives the narrative but lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with solar panels and orchard creating a moody atmosphere, but sensory details (e.g., "scent of blooming apples") could more deeply mirror emotional beats or thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Literary devices (fate-as-destination, pruning-as-leadership) are effective. Ending achieves emotional resonance, though some themes require subtler execution to avoid didactic undertones.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh use of solar panels/orchard juxtaposition. Some phrases ("bittersweet resilience") risk purple prose. Character psychology avoids tropes but could show more vulnerability beneath stoicism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite intricate elements, though certain devices (handshakes, disclaimers) occasionally feel mechanical. Strong thematic grounding in fate vs. agency, but emotional register remains slightly restrained.</comment>
