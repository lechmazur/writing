<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; fails to delve into why the physician remains obsessively fixated on temple lore despite exhaustion, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with a clear arc, but the abrupt resolution leaves the consequences of invoking the curse insufficiently explored within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details, but the digital nomad setting and mystical elements remain superficially juxtaposed without deeper thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Storytelling employs effective metaphors and visual contrasts, but emotional stakes feel underdeveloped through "showing," leaning too often on descriptive summation rather than lived experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Blends genre elements creatively but occasionally lapses into clich√©d tropes (pirate curses, coffee-ground divination), with prose oscillating between poetic and overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven: some connections to theme are effective, but others (digital nomad camp specifically) seem arbitrarily chosen rather than organically essential.</comment>
