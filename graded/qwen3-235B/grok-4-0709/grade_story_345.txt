<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by doubt and rebellion against complacency, but interiority remains abstract; motivations are clear but lack emotional depth through underdeveloped reactions to symbols like the abacus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from doubt to action, but pacing feels compressed; cause/effect between snow patterns and spiritual crisis lacks psychological nuance within tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually arresting with tactile details (snow's texture, beanstalks as "judgmental sentinels"), though mystical elements risk overwhelming grounded emotional stakes in the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (abacus as eroded faith, labyrinth as fate) but undercut by overt thematic signposting; ending resolves too neatly for a story aiming at existential ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Evocative language borders on purple prose; snow patterns as plot device feels artificial, some phrases overly ornate ("threads of fate unraveling") without deepening human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements like the abacus and orchard contribute meaningfully, but beanstalks risk decorative surrealism; brevity both focuses and restricts thematic resonance.</comment>
