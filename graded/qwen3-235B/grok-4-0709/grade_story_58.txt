<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's loyalty is central but her radicalization lacks psychological depth; her motivations shift abruptly without sufficient nuance, though her journaling provides partial continuity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The plot arc exists but feels compressed; the Sage’s comedic routines pivot too abruptly from dread to absurdity, straining cause-effect logic. Pacing stumbles under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich immersive details (moths, flickering lights) create a vivid, tense atmosphere. Setting and tone are intricately connected, though some metaphorical links (storms, rebellion) feel over-explained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Subtext about rebellion through coded humor is thought-provoking. Strong symbolism (storm equilibrium as metaphor for revolution) and layered themes elevate the narrative, though the ending lacks thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some lush descriptions border on purple prose, and the Sage’s comedic radicalization method veers toward contrived absurdity. Avoids overt tropes but occasionally substitutes formulaic "depth" for human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ignores some element synergies (e.g., "individually common" patterns) but creates memorable imagery through juxtapositions like holy terror and comedy. The short form feels purposeful but unevenly executed.</comment>
