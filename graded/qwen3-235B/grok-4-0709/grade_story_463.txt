<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but thin emotional stakes; Elias's wit and motivation to learn binding methods are clear but lack deeper connection to his role as sentinel or consequences of failure. Interactions with Mira rely on tropes rather than organic tension. Internal conflict remains superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure driven by dance-as-ritual but pacing feels rushed; confiscation of locket resolves arc cleanly yet the buildup to trust feels abrupt. Core action (dance-to-disarm) is inventive but cause-effect lacks weight—Mira's ready acquiescence weakens thematic resonance of "eroding promises."</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly vivid (salt-crusted walls, blade-like beam) yet setting never transcends Gothic backdrop; location's maritime history and spectral ties remain underexplored. Sensory details immerse but fail to interrogate how physical space mirrors eroding vows or Elias's internal state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dance-as-battle serves as strong metaphor but emotional impact remains surface-level; "reckless precision" motif and ritualistic tension resonate while deeper themes (binding vs. release, legacy of duty) lack complexity. Ending closes cleanly but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on Gothic tropes (haunted keepers, tragic ghosts) with minimal subversion; language vacillates between sharp ("dry-witted") and ornate ("spectral whispers echoed off salt-crusted walls"). Tango-based climax leans on contrived romanticism over organic symbolism; resolves through narrative convenience rather than earned trust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but rarely coalesce into transcendent whole; rope and locket function well as symbols while dance feels imposed rather than inevitable. Premise intrigues but thematic ambition (duty, release) outpaces execution—ultimately a polished genre piece rather than profound literary work.</comment>
