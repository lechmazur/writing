<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prince's motivation of curing loneliness is consistent but lacks nuanced emotional depth; his transformation through the herbalist feels somewhat rushed without fully showing psychological progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies heavily on contrivance (snowstorm as narrative contrivance); the connection between locking the past away and spiritual healing is underdeveloped despite thematic potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Detailed setting creates atmosphere but fails to fully integrate thematic elements; the 'familiar unknown' feels more like surface-level description than a narrative lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery elevates the prose, but thematic resolution feels overly tidy; some show-don't-tell principles honored unevenly, with abstract emotional states often stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overuse of mythical resonance tropes (herbalist savior, enchanted storms) undermines originality; the mortar/pestle provides unique specificity but other elements verge on archetypal abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competently uses all assigned elements but feels more engineered than organic; the closing metamorphosis into 'unintentionally iconic' figure strains credibility despite effective metaphorical scaffolding.</comment>
