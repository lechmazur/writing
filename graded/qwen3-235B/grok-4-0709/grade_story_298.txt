<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distinctive traits like "rationally impulsive" lack organic integration; motivations feel imposed rather than organically revealed through action. The chameleon aspect is used practically but doesn't deeply explore psychological implications of identity-shifting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but sacrifices pacing â€“ crucial developments (actor gathering, emotional transitions) rushed. The reproduction method drives action effectively but lacks sufficient setup for its unconventional investigative approach.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent contrasts between ancient and post-oil aesthetics create vivid atmosphere. Solar-powered elements feel superficially sketched but the bamboo/porcelain imagery and anxious serenity are masterfully rendered through precise sensorial detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., sunlight revealing hidden writing) work well, but emotional impact relies too heavily on explanatory prose rather than subtext. The theme of art-as-truth resonates but resolution feels overly neat for such a dense narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Visionary setting elements verge on technocratic fantasy. Some passages exhibit formulaic description ("echoes of forgotten emperors"). The rationally impulsive trait especially feels analytical rather than organically human. Sensory details occasionally prioritize novelty over narrative resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully unifies disparate elements through the central metaphor of theatrical revelation. The tight word count strains character development but creates effective dramatic momentum. Leverages constraints to emphasize thematic throughlines rather than feeling restricted by them.</comment>
