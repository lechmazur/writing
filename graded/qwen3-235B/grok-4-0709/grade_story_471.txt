<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Premature assignment of "meticulously careless" lacks demonstration; motivation for mapping ghost towns tethered to grief feels surface-level rather than organically tied to concrete actions; spectral dialogues force introspection without earning emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear throughline from forgotten promise to resolution, but exposition-heavy middle drags pacing; spectral encounters drive plot but resolution feels rushed, compressing thematic revelations into abrupt final paragraph.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d "haunted funfair" tropes; misty forest setting functions superficially as decor rather than integral psychological space; sensory details are numerous but generic (e.g., "desperate fingers," "heartbeat drum"), evoking checklist adherence over immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>"Bold vulnerability" manifests through physical courage vs. emotional avoidance; dialogue-heavy introspection juxtaposed with atmospheric melancholia creates thematic resonance; lens as metaphor for processing memory operates on dual levels; ending subverts narrative expectations by making vulnerability an active choice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Phrases like "chasing shadows" and "atomizing chaos" avoid trite spiritual metaphors; spectral musicians employ idiosyncratic instruments that reflect internal struggles; emotional progression shown through environmental interaction (lens warming) rather than stated realizations; avoids over-explaining supernatural elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Excessive ornamental description dilutes tension; core concept of "atomize" forced through unnatural metaphor; atmospheric elements don't coalesce into unified thematic whole; character arc resolution feels imposed rather than emergent from narrative logic.</comment>
