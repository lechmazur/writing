<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has surface traits (spirited lumberjack, awkward grace) but lacks psychological depth; motivations tied to childhood trauma feel perfunctorily inserted rather than organically developed through narrative choices</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot attempts nonlinear coherence through coded letter revelations but strains under word limit; ending transformation feels abrupt despite thematic consistency in healing/redemption framework</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vaulted ossuary restaurant with bone-herb decor creates striking, thematically resonant atmosphere; sensory details about marrow smells and echoing boots immerse reader effectively</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "harsh tenderness" create memorable imagery; subtextual connections between logging/healing lack sufficient narrative manifestation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies heavily on purple prose ("bruising sunset," "spectral battles") and conceptual clich√©s (haunted healer trope); uneven balance between poetic language and narrative clarity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements like bone-based healing and dystopian war feel conceptually grafted rather than naturally entwined; bike rides function as structural device but not deep thematic anchor</comment>
