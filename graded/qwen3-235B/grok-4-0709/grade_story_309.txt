<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive but relies heavily on noir tropes; motivations for memory-seeking are emotionally resonant but undercut by overwrought internal monologue obscuring nuanced psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pseudo-arcs exist (memory retrieval, resolution) but lack traditional plot momentum; pacing fluctuates between atmospheric lingering and abrupt emotional payoffs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gallery setting offers rich visual metaphors for memory distortion; atmospheric details lack texture beyond optical illusions and oppressive silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Conceptual cohesion in memory-as-antidote-to-oblivion works, but density of stylistic flourishes overshadows narrative economy needed for tighter 500-word impact.</comment>
