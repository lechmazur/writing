<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is well-established, but motivation for organizing as catharsis lacks sufficient emotional nuance; psychological shifts feel somewhat pat despite strong thematic underpinnings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence and satisfying circularity but pacing falters in midsection; the seesaw's symbolic function overshadows its narrative utility, creating imbalance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory detail and symbolic resonance between setting and psyche; however, the construction setting occasionally feels overstated rather than organically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphoric framework (prismatic lake, seesaw's rhythm) elevates thematic depth; ending achieves emotional resonance but slightly over-explains, diminishing subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elegant prose occasionally lapses into calculated lyricism; while clich√©s are subverted, some metaphors (guilt as cacophony) border on conceptual over-determination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story succeeds through precise element integration despite slight unevenness; the juxtaposition of personal and environmental reconstruction offers compelling tension that justifies form constraints.</comment>
