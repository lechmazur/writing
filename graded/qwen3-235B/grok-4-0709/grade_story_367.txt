<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "sapped" state and "thoughtfully thoughtless" approach are clearly expressed through her physical exhaustion and obsessive rituals, but her internal voice lacks distinctiveness. The "price of perfection" shapes her actions coherently, though her sudden shift to acceptance at the end feels underdeveloped despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The goose's flight creates a pivotal decision point that propels the plot, and the story maintains arc (obsession → surrender → realization). However, the resolution feels rushed; the transition from exhaustion to self-awareness lacks emotional grounding within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong visual imagery (glass walls, fog-rattling gusts) establishes atmosphere but feels overly generalized. Sensory details like "crashing waves" and "bellows' breath" connect to the theme but could be more visceral or distinctive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like the bellows mirroring ocean rhythms and the goose as a symbol of control work effectively. The ending's thematic contrast between isolation and acceptance is impactful, though emotional resonance relies too heavily on explicit statements ("hollow indifference") rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some abstract phrasing ("fervent indifference," "tide patterns holding the key") borders on artificial profundity. While the goose ritual and bellows show ingenuity, the relentless focus on contradictions (obsession/indifference) feels occasionally contrived rather than organically explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story weaves elements into a coherent whole but unevenly. The observatory's setting and "price of perfection" integrate strongly, but the goose method feels arbitrary. The ending provokes reflection on artistic obsession but lacks lingering emotional or philosophical weight.</comment>
