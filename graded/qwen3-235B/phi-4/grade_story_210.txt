<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (fusing lore/dreams) consistent but shallow; actions driven by plot needs rather than organic development; lacks internal conflict or nuance beyond archetypal role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abstract progression (solving crossword = completing narrative arc), but lacks concrete stakes or traditional structure; resolution feels abrupt rather than earned within constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (sensory details anchor mood), but setting’s connection to plot remains symbolic rather than tangibly integral; haunted lighthouse’s lore feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (light, shadows, timbers) elevates thematic resonance, but overt moralizing weakens subtlety; ending’s thematic closure overshadows narrative satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on gothic tropes (haunted lighthouse, dancing shadows) with minimal subversion; lush prose leans into purple patches; emotional depth often stated rather than shown.</comment>
