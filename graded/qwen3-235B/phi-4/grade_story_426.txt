<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations lack depth; Eli's secretive nature and forgotten prodigy status are vaguely linked to his actions. Emotional shifts feel unmotivated. The "angrily peaceful" tone is inconsistently applied to his behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ghost train setting provides a strong spine, but the marathon training feels tacked on rather than integral. The music playlist method disrupts narrative logic. Pacing is uneven but resolves cohesively with the teapot symbolism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere is established through auditory details ("spectral whispers") and visual decay ("creaking corridors"), but the haunted amusement park's specific potential isn't fully exploited. Sensory details for folk medicines are generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong poetic imagery ("dance with shadows") and teapot symbolism present, but emotional resonance remains surface-level. The ending feels thematically complete yet lacks lingering impact. Theme of legacy is clear but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park and ghost train lean on well-worn tropes without subversion. Overly ornate descriptors ("alofuflly defiant") verge on purple prose. Music playlist concept feels algorithmic rather than organic to the folk medicine theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Packed with rich elements but struggles with cohesion. Some narrative choices (ghostly hug, music hacking) feel like arbitrary combinations rather than thematically driven decisions. Conceptually ambitious but execution uneven.</comment>
