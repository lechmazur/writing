<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's calmness and "brash tenderness" are evident but muddled with underdeveloped "bruiser" traits; motivation lacks psychological depth despite symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but loses momentum in compressed pacing; transitions between key moments feel abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly imagined (humidity, rustling plants) but inconsistent sensory integration undermines full immersion in the surreal greenhouse setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combines tropes (mythic quests, labyrinths) with surreal elements but relies on overused descriptors ("cacophony," "suffocating humidity") that border on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack transformative synergy; the concise format occasionally feels constrained rather than purposeful.</comment>
