<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's overqualification and motivation lack concrete demonstration; traits like "intellectually dreamy" are stated but not embodied through specific actions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., patrons' sudden conversion to her vision) lack development within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (fireflies, autumn) but relies heavily on clichéd imagery; sensory details lack originality and deeper integration with the character's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Themes of reinvention are clear but underdeveloped; relies on abstract telling ("bruised exhilaration") over immersive showing; ending feels predictable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Language veers toward clichés and formal abstraction ("dreamed intellectually," "bruised exhilaration"); metaphors lack freshness, and emotional resonance feels mechanically assigned rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements like postcards and fireflies feel tacked onto a pre-existing template rather than organically driving the narrative; the brief length emphasizes structural thinness.</comment>
