<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivation to preserve recipes feels externally imposed rather than organically developed through actions. "Factually imaginative" trait remains superficially demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on arbitrary symbolic gestures over logical progression; hopscotch pattern revelation feels contrived. Pacing alternates between rushed and stagnant, with sudden emotional shifts undercutting narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Parchment-pine atmosphere skillfully evokes melancholy, but setting fails to actively shape plot or character decisions. Sensory details immersive yet divorced from narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric language ("whispering relics") elevates style, but lacks subtextual depth or thematic tension. Emotional responses are stated rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on decorative abstraction ("mournful elation") and AI-typical associative leaps (hopscotch/recipes connection). Overwrought descriptions substitute for concrete storytelling; concept lacks genuine emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Narrative exists in a thematic vacuum; elements feel stitched together through metaphorical convenience rather than organic necessity. Fails to transcend assigned components, leaving behind no resonant idea or philosophical question.</comment>
