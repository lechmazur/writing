<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's role as an alchemist lacks clear connection to her actions; her motivation is stated but underdeveloped, and "regular organic routines" feel tangential to her personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Basic arc from cipher-decoding to revelation exists, but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect between the coin’s glow and her realization lacks sufficient build-up.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indispensable; the tight structure suggests deliberate brevity, though key connections between setting, character, and theme remain underdeveloped.</comment>
