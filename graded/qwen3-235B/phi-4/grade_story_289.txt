<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's intellect is stated but underdemonstrated; her motivation to find civilizations feels abstract rather than visceral, though her interaction with the doll hints at layered vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks tension or discernible structure beyond vignette-like reflection; the ephemeral art device drives the narrative but lacks emotional or logistical stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The bay's glow creates atmosphere but isn't woven into the story's core mechanics; faster-than-light travel is mentioned without thematic or worldbuilding integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The porcelain doll and bioluminescent imagery evoke subtext effectively; the ending resolves introspectively but feels emotionally flat despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Over-reliance on vague descriptors ("surreal," "ephemeral") and clich√©d metaphors ("whisper encouragement"); the doll concept straddles originality but leans on familiar symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack transformative interplay; the story reads as competent but predictable, with no enduring emotional imprint or narrative innovation.</comment>
