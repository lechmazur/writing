<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but underexplored; motivations around legacy are present but lack emotional depth or nuanced reaction to elements like the secret handshake manual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but lacks tension or clear cause-effect; the pruning action is central but the story’s vignette nature weakens plot progression within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes solar panels and orchard for atmosphere, but sensory details are sparse and fail to deeply connect mood or theme; tone is inconsistently evoked.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</comment><comment>Vague metaphors (pruning/leadership) lack impact; ending leans on cliché (“never stop pruning”); subtext is hinted at but not developed for lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on generic descriptors (“gnarled trees,” “bittersweet grit”) and predictable themes of legacy; lacks ingenuity in subverting tropes or avoiding formulaic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elements are present but loosely interwoven; brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; lacks cohesion and a lingering thematic punch despite thematic signposts.</comment>
