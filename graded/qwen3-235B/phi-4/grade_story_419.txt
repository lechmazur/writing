<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's blacksmith identity lacks integration with her stained glass creation; her empathy is stated but not deeply demonstrated. Motivation to mollify spirits via tradition aligns with actions, but the "steadily free" trait remains abstract and unconnected to her core role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear progression from creation to resolution, but the word limit results in a rushed emotional payoff. Assigned action (mollify) drives the plot, yet the heartbeat sync method lacks logical cause-effect integration with spirit appeasement. Pacing uneven in middle segments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dollhouse museum's miniature scale is underutilized; haunting remains superficial. Atmosphere leans on generic descriptors ("shadowy," "kaleidoscope") rather than unique sensory details connecting the setting to stained glass or traditions. The dollhouse's symbolic potential goes untapped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism of the ornament as a "beacon" effectively conveys theme, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy exposition. Some lyrical passages contrast with flat declarations of feeling. The ending resolves neatly but lacks lingering resonance beyond surface sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on haunted-house tropes and familiar motifs like "kaleidoscope of colors." The heartbeat sync method feels contrived, bordering on mystical hand-waving. Prose occasionally veers into purple territory ("tapestry of empathy"), and emotional stakes lack nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Required elements are present but unevenly weighted. The dollhouse setting and blacksmith character feel imposed rather than organically fused. The concept's brevity works thematically but sacrifices narrative depth. Lingering impression is atmospheric but conceptually shallow.</comment>
