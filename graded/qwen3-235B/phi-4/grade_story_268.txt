<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits like 'artfully clumsy' are stated but minimally demonstrated; motivation to master an ancient art tied to war’s price lacks psychological specificity; reactions to objects like the mirror feel abstract rather than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structure follows a loose arc of reflection to resolve, but lacks concrete cause-effect progression; the method of tracking distortions drives thematic exploration more than plot momentum, feeling static within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Abandoned waiting area evokes decay through sensory details (dust, cracked windows), complementing the 'screaming silence' tone; however, the connection between virtual calls and the physical setting remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror distortions as war’s aftermath) are present but thinly developed; theme of peace as a navigable path lacks emotional urgency; ending resolves neatly without lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar imagery (e.g., 'dust danced in slivers of light'); 'artfully clumsy' and funhouse mirror border on contrived; prose occasionally becomes ornate without purpose (e.g., 'echoes of forgotten conversations').</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are dutifully included but cohesion is strained; the story’s brevity prioritizes concept over depth, leaving themes feeling aspirational rather than realized; lacks distinctive stylistic ambition.</comment>
