<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (archiving rituals) is clear but underdeveloped. The stoic trait lacks concrete behavioral manifestations. Necessary lies are mentioned but not dramatized as internal conflict. The floorboard's significance feels stated rather than earned through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Circular plot structure with vague cause-and-effect. The action of "imposing will" lacks concrete execution details. Ritual completion feels abrupt, with unresolved tension between truth/deception. Pacing uneven - contemplative moments followed by rushed climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are abstract and generic (whispers, flickering flames). The witch's training ground setting isn't distinct from generic fantasy tropes. Atmosphere relies on vague "haunting" without specific emotional texture. Timeframe element (teacher's action) feels arbitrarily inserted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mild emotional resonance from historical preservation theme. Overused metaphors (whispers of the past) and forced poetic phrases ("brash tenderness"). The ending lacks punch - ritual completion isn't dramatized with tangible consequences. Central conflict remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Riddled with clich√©s ("whispers of the past," "flickering flames"). Overly formal diction ("archive the ritual practices") creates artificiality. Sudden shifts in metaphoric register ("necessary lies" vs "brash tenderness"). Character reasoning follows template logic rather than human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story feels like checklist fulfillment rather than cohesive narrative. Assigned elements create structural strain. The brief form highlights rather than conceals conceptual vagueness. No lingering impact - themes dissipate rather than resonate. Style seems generated rather than crafted.</comment>
