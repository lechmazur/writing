<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's "scrappy" quality remains superficial; motivations lack psychological nuance despite stated aspirations. Internal logic of actions (placing shells) disconnected from concrete emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative framework holds together despite word constraints, but several plot points (shell transformation, voice in mind) occur without sufficient causality or earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting descriptors (vacuum chamber, reverse time) superficially applied; atmosphere inconsistently maintained through sensory details. Time flow concept only decoratively utilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of brokenness/imperfection offer depth but are over-explained rather than dramatized. Powerful imagery (glowing footprints) undercut by tidy conclusions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps but contains occasional purple prose ("flippant solemnity," "inescapability callings"). Some metaphors feel strained rather than freshly observed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements combine into marginally coherent whole but fail to transcend their assembly. Conceptual ambition evident, though brevity works against narrative depth and emotional authenticity.</comment>
