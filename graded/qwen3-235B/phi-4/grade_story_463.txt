<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "dry-witted" manifest briefly but lack depth; motivation (confiscating secrets via dance) feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded; reactions to "eroding promises" and the rope remain underdeveloped thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague rituals rather than clear cause-effect; arbitrary jumps like magic-rope reactions undermine coherence; the circular structure (room entering/leaving) creates artificial closure without earned resolution; pacing prioritizes mood over momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through evocative details (candlelight, shadows, frayed fibers) that amplify hauntology; setting/dance connection is palpable but underexploited; sensory immersion compensates for thin conceptual anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of dance-as-communication with spirits offers intriguing subtext, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; ending lacks earned catharsis, leaning on vague "truth found" tropes; competent but unexceptional craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Haunted lighthouse" and "dance ritual" lean on genre clich√©s without subversion; ornate prose ("reckless precision") often feels self-consciously poetic; character logic (obsessive dance to "confiscate secrets") lacks human nuance; metaphors verge on abstract obfuscation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are superficially cohesive but thematically isolated; length masks underdeveloped ideas rather than focusing impact; writing shows ambition but lacks the precision to fully synthesize assigned components into transcendent narrative.</comment>
