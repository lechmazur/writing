<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like apathy and defiance are stated but underexplored in action; motivation to leave is abrupt, lacking emotional depth. Bag and hidden promise remain underdeveloped symbols.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear structure but rushed pacing; meteor-following method lacks logical connection to characterâ€™s apathy-defiance arc. Inertia-to-redemption shift feels unearned despite narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Floating monastery is evocatively described but functions as backdrop, not active participant. Atmosphere aligns with tone but lacks visceral sensory details to anchor existential themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (meteors, spark) are functional but not revelatory. Ending resolves cleanly but avoids emotional complexity; relies on telling vs. showing (e.g., "he felt lighter").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attempts novelty with meteors as guidance but falls into monastic redemption tropes. Language avoids purple prose but leans on familiar phrases ("weight of apathy"). Subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coherent but predictable arc uses assigned elements mechanically. Strongest in atmospheric cohesion; weakest in character depth. Fulfills technical requirements but lacks transformative impact.</comment>
