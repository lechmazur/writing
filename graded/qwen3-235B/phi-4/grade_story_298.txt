<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Li Wei’s chameleon trait is superficially tied to his shifting eyes, not his actions or decisions. Motivation to “weave emotional honesty into illusions” lacks concrete connection to his role as a stage actor or his method of solving cold cases. His “rationally impulsive” attribute feels arbitrarily applied, and his reasoning for solving the mystery lacks human nuance, leaning on formulaic plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is loosely coherent but constrained by the word limit. The cold-case mystery resolution is abrupt, relying on a convenient diary discovery. Cause-and-effect feels mechanical, with pacing unevenly distributed—skipping from atmospheric setup to sudden revelations. The ending resolves the actress’s disappearance but leaves Li Wei’s purpose shift unexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The setting—post-oil-extraction palace—is underutilized, with inconsistent sensory details. Sunlight through debris creates mood but isn’t meaningfully connected to the plot. “Anxious serenity” is hinted at but diluted by generic descriptors (e.g., “whispering tales of lost innocence”). The fusion of historical and speculative elements lacks immersive, specific textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses symbolic objects (dress, diary) to explore themes of illusion vs. truth, with some effective imagery. However, emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on telling (“yearning for freedom”) and a tidy resolution that simplifies complex themes. The ending’s reflective tone elevates the story, but subtext remains shallow compared to surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (abandoned palace mystery, diary clues) without subverting them. Prose veers between overly ornate (“mosaic of light and shadow”) and flat exposition. Character motivation is stated, not shown, and emotional honesty feels prescribed rather than earned. The blend of historical and speculative elements lacks ingenuity, feeling derivative rather than fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story incorporates assigned elements haphazardly. While the dress and cold-case method are central, their integration feels contrived (e.g., the diary as a deus ex machina). The tone lacks consistency, and the brevity feels limiting rather than intentional. Despite a thematic throughline, the narrative fails to leave a lasting impression or provoke deeper reflection.</comment>
