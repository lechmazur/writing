<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character inconsistencies, underdeveloped skepticism, motivation occasionally strained; actions (impounding) more compelling than internal contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks dynamic progression; circular structure weakens arc; cause-effect connections between scrawls, farm, and dish feel undercooked despite tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie, atmospheric setting with vivid sensory details, but tone ("frantic peace") inconsistently applied; some elements (mushrooms as beacon) poorly synchronized with mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on vague symbolism; some poignant moments undercut by abrupt thematic generalizations and passive emotional engagement; ending feels perfunctory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original setting undermined by generic phrases ("beacon," "journey"); avoids clich√©s in premise but falters with predictable emotional beats and occasionally florid prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition unevenly rewarded; atmosphere and unique premise compensate for structural flaws, but deeper thematic cohesion needed for prestigious publication.</comment>
