<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characters remain surface-level; frailty and wavering resolve are stated but not deeply explored through internal conflict or nuanced transformation. Motivation is clear but execution lacks emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels condensed, with cause-effect gaps in Eamon’s transformation. Pacing is uneven—ending resolves too quickly without earning the shift from frailty to agency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes sensory details (sea, phial’s sourness) and tone, but the tidal island’s role remains superficial. The setting’s potential to mirror thematic tensions (e.g., shifting loyalties as tides) is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery (whispers of the sea, glowing carvings) supports thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by predictable metaphors (“wavering heart”). The ending’s inspirational tone feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (magic phials, escape-from-fate arcs) without meaningful subversion. Prose occasionally slips into ornate abstraction (“hopeful melancholy”) rather than vivid specificity, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack cohesion. The tight word count strains narrative depth, making themes feel declarative rather than explored. Stylistic consistency is present but lacks distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
