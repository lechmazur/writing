<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "jumpy" and "necromancer" are superficially noted but underdeveloped; motivation to "unmask" lacks psychological depth, and the protagonist’s arc feels abrupt and unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Predictable structure with abrupt transitions; the journey to the icon is rushed, and cause-effect relationships (e.g., how paint drips lead to symbols) lack logical flow within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich but sensory depth is limited to sight; the retro setting adds flavor but rarely influences plot or character beyond superficial descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors ("echoing footsteps") and clichéd themes (self-discovery); the ending lacks resonance, leaning on vague portent rather than emotional or thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("pixelated landscapes stretched endlessly") and generic descriptors ("vibrant colors") undermine authenticity; character psychology feels simplistic and artificial.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements are ticked off but not tightly integrated; the story prioritizes checklist compliance over cohesive artistry, with a rushed tone and underexplored themes.</comment>
