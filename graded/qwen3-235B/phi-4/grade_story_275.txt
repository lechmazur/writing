<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character’s “theoretically rebellious” trait remains underexplored; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth. Actions align with determination but not with rebellion or mindfulness explicitly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure feels perfunctory; the comet’s zenith resolves conflict too conveniently. Pacing rushes the climax, leaving little room to earn the miraculous growth beyond setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (burning comet, ghostly orchard) but overly reliant on vague descriptors like “deliberate wilderness.” Sensory details are present but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (pressed flowers, weathervane) enriches themes but lacks subtext. Ending resolves neatly but avoids deeper exploration of transformation’s cost or ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality in combining weathervane and comet, but “hermit” and “barren land” lean on tropes. Some metaphors (e.g., “whispers of the earth”) feel overused; tone occasionally veers into ornate vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interdependence. Themes of renewal feel stated rather than earned through character growth or narrative complexity. Too reliant on atmospheric shorthand.</comment>
