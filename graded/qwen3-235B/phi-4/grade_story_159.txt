<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character is symbolic but lacks psychological depth; motivations are abstract rather than visceral, with traits inconsistently embodied through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structure exists but feels predetermined; transitions between conceptual beats (e.g., lanterns, weddings) strain cause-effect logic, with the tight word limit exposing unresolved narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting offers atmospheric potential (floating lanterns, sandstone) but sensory immersion remains superficial; tone oscillates between poetic and hollow without cohesive emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical moments (kaleidoscope symbolism) but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on metaphors-as-substance; ending feels formulaic rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Performs "originality" through surrealism but relies on clichéd tropes (labyrinths as life metaphors) and uneven prose rhythms that suggest algorithmic pattern generation rather than organic authorship.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are nominally integrated but lack synergistic cohesion; the story’s brevity highlights its conceptual scaffolding over organic narrative flow or lasting resonance.</comment>
