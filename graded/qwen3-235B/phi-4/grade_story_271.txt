<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit but underdeveloped; "defiant compassion" lacks behavioral grounding. Character voice subsumed by lyrical prose, reducing emotional immediacy despite clear thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tight structure prioritizes mood over narrative momentum. Beginning/end connection exists thematically but lacks structural surprise; juggling sequence feels static despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (spices, dust) immerse but verge on cloying. Lab setting symbolically rich yet underutilized – functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than active narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (bent ruler as resilience) elevate craftsmanship, but thematic telling outweighs showing. Ending resonates conceptually yet feels emotionally detached. Central conflict between tradition/rebellion remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality diluted by Gothic clichés (abandoned labs, whispering aromas). Sensory descriptions occasionally border on purple prose; symbolic logic coherent but execution occasionally mechanical rather than viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion maintained through poetic repetition rather than organic integration. Assigned elements service theme but create thematic redundancy. Brevity works conceptually but sacrifices character depth and narrative stakes.</comment>
