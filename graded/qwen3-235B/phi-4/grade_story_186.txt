<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elara’s whimsy and motivation to chronicle environmental changes lack psychological depth; her actions feel abstract rather than driven by concrete interiority. The thermometer and fortune-tellers don’t fully reveal her character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot is amorphous, with no rising action or resolution. The "arc" is a static meditation on mortality, rendering causality and pacing irrelevant. Lacks narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Suspended palace and stalactites create visual intrigue but exist as backdrop rather than integral setting. Sensory details are sparse; atmosphere relies on vague poeticism over immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors ("fleeting beauty," "balance of life") and tells emotion through abstraction rather than concrete imagery. Attempts thematic depth but lacks evocative execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Excessive adjectives and repetitive phrases ("suspended palace," "truthful reflection") feel formulaic. Tropes like "art defying mortality" are unchallenged; lacks subversive or idiosyncratic vision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Forced integration of elements (e.g., thermometer, stalactites) prioritizes checklisting over cohesion. Themes are stated, not earned; story feels more curated than organically written.</comment>
