<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; traits like "softhearted" and "fierce determination" are stated but never dramatized through concrete actions or internal conflict. Reactions to cosmic elements feel arbitrary, motivations are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot has superficial shape but lacks logical progression. Sudden shift from crime-solving to cosmic manipulation feels unearned. Cause-effect relationships between buckle discovery and planetarium visits are muddled. Pacing drags in critical sections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses cyberpunk and astronomical imagery competently but not originally. Sensory details are unevenly deployed - visual descriptions dominate while other senses are neglected. Planetarium setting has potential but under-exploited atmospheric depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on overused metaphors ("threads of fate") rather than fresh literary devices. Theme of cosmic transformation remains abstract rather than visceral. Ending feels like empty poetic abstraction rather than earned resolution. Shows more than tells, but lacks emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Exhibits numerous AI-writing markers: formulaic phrase loops ("muted euphoria"), generic descriptors, abrupt tonal shifts. Relies on cyberpunk/cosmic tropes without subverting expectations. Emotional beats are stated rather than earned through characterization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Story incorporates all required elements but fails to integrate them cohesively. Excessive focus on atmospheric description detracts from narrative momentum. Style oscillates between purple prose and clinical detachment. Leaves little lasting resonance beyond surface-level ideas.</comment>
