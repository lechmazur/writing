<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and underdeveloped; motivations lack emotional resonance or specific behavioral evidence, with rebelliousness feeling like surface-level description rather than demonstrated through meaningful actions or internal conflict</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on generic "journey to library" structure; pivotal moments lack causal logic or narrative weight, with rushed transition between public marketplace and private chamber diminishing stakes or sense of accomplishment</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Revolutionary atmosphere hinted at through vague "whispers" but never materializes into tangible world-building; sensory details present but generic (groaning shelves, humming pipes) rather than distinctive, period-appropriate specifics</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical elements (mask as desire-manifestor) introduced but under-explored; ending fails to deliver thematic catharsis, with "obituaries as call to action" idea stated rather than demonstrated through earned narrative/emotional consequences</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Overuses clich√©d phrasing ("labyrinth of choices," "weight of ancient tomes") and predictable symbolic pairings; prose veers between poetic pretension and exposition-dumping, with repetitive descriptors undermining originality</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Feeling of artificial construct rather than organic storytelling; assigned elements awkwardly graft onto generic plot framework rather than shaping coherent narrative logic; ambitious concepts remain superficially treated</comment>
