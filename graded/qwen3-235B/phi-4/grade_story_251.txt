<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits present but underdeveloped; ambivalence and "happily sad" inform actions superficially; motivation to "scramble the cosmic scoreboard" remains abstract; distinct voice lacks human nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses via symbolic action but feels rushed in word limit; cause-effect between puzzles and cosmic transformation illogical; beginning-middle-end structure implied but lacks narrative tension; pacing uneven in key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lunar setting provides atmospheric novelty but fails to leverage environmental specifics (e.g., low gravity, isolation); sensory details limited to sound/light; atmosphere complements tone but doesn’t deepen thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism in marbles and puzzles transcends surface narrative; ending resonates thematically but risks pretension; quieter emotional moments undercut by overuse of paradoxical phrasing; subtext about incremental change is compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Combines tropes (prophets, cosmic puzzles) with unique method, though execution veers toward purple prose; emotional descriptors often stated rather than shown; metaphors feel purposeful but occasionally redundant (e.g., "happily sad" repeated four times).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elian’s actions anchor cohesion but elements like "between heartbeats" and "final oath" remain underutilized; stylized prose serves theme yet hinders clarity; compact structure highlights concept but may lack emotional payoff for general readers.</comment>
