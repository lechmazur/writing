<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Ambiguous cause/effect for the doodles' significance; rushed, fragmented pacing undermines the arc; abrupt shifts between plot beats dilute coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Superficial sensory details (birds, spices) lack deeper thematic linkage; the sanctuary setting and "edgy nostalgia" feel disassociated from character/plot stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d epiphany about creativity; excessive "telling" of emotions/thematic points; repetitive metaphors (e.g., glowing flower) fail to resonate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Vintage AI-style purple prose and generic "golden glow" descriptors; predictable romantic beats and "ancient maps in books" tropes without subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements feel arbitrarily assembled (e.g., kissing timeframe irrelevant to plot); superficial "quest" theme lacks emotional or intellectual urgency; brevity exposes underdevelopment.</comment>
