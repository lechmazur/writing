<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation (preserving rituals) is clear but under-explored beyond statement. "Diligently whimsical" shapes demeanor but lacks tangible action evidence. No distinct narrative voice weakens engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Static vignette lacks plot propulsion beyond cyclical introspection. Pacing meditative but risks stagnation. Beginning/middle/end coherence achieved minimally via daylight progression, not narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Raucous silence as paradoxical atmosphere is vividly sustained. Sensory details (carvings, wind, shadows) immerse readers, though Aztec specifics remain surface-level decorative rather than culturally specific.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("whispering wind," "dance of symbols") create emotional resonance, but underdeveloped tension/arc prevents deeper thematic payoff. Ending feels elegiac but unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative yet occasionally generic descriptors ("whispers of another time"). Avoids overt tropes but leans on mystical archaeology clich√©s. Language is lyrical without venturing into true innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive atmospheric piece with strong elemental integration (magnifying glass, temple), but length exposes lack of narrative urgency. Elegantly written but lacks transformative depth.</comment>
