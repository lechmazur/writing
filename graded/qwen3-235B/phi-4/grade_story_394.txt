<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character's "aimlessly passionate" trait inconsistently portrayed; motivations shift from aimless to purposeful without emotional nuance or believable transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Predictable arch structure progresses from entrance to revelation, but the method (leaves) lacks logic and the climactic discovery feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©s (hidden scrolls, whispering leaves) and abrupt transitions; emotional resonance is surface-level, with overused phrases undermining originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present but superficially integrated; story structure feels constrained by checklist rather than organic cohesion.</comment>
