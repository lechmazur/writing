<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (poisoner, "innocently guilty") remain superficial, disconnected from actions. Motivation to "test edges of gravity" lacks narrative substance or psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt plot lacks tension or conflict. Pacing is static; cause-effect relationships are implied but underdeveloped. Resolution feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere evoked via "dusty starlight" and museum setting is evocative but underutilized. Sensory details lack integration with character’s internal arc or plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Thematic ideas about instinct/intellect are stated rather than dramatized. Relies on abstract adjectives over concrete imagery; ending lacks emotional or conceptual resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing ("playground of possibilities," "whispered secrets") and clichéd binaries ("danger and beauty") suggest formulaic writing. Lacks stylistic originality or tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements like scavenger hunt and museum are superficially present but feel compartmentalized. Story prioritizes aesthetic over narrative cohesion, leaving themes underexplored.</comment>
