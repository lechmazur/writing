<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stated motivations are clear but lack nuanced demonstration through conflict or decision-making; character voice remains underdeveloped despite first-person-like prose; loyalty attribute feels declarative rather than experientially revealed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot begins with discovery but lacks rising action or tangible stakes; method of deciphering bruises remains abstract and doesn't concretely advance narrative; abrupt shifts between reflective passages and plot mechanics disrupt pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Frozen harbor's mechanical elements and carnival poster contrast create visual interest but fail to produce visceral sensory immersion; atmospheric details hint at themes without crystallizing into emotionally resonant textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'language as soul' provide thematic backbone, but emotional beats rely disproportionately on exposition; ending resolves too abstractly to qualify as satisfying while avoiding overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar dystopian-esque imagery (mechanized societies eroding tradition); originality emerges primarily through conceptual premise rather than stylistic execution or character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Required elements present but functionally disconnected; attempts at thematic depth overshadow character agency; brevity works against narrative complexity despite earnest exploration of language preservation dilemmas.</comment>
