<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's fading glory is hinted but lacks psychological depth; motivation to "map consciousness flows" feels abstract rather than organically derived from character struggles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear progression exists (wandering→finding swan→epiphany) but lacks narrative tension; cause-effect between symbolic object and character transformation feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ethereal mist and broken clock establish mood but function as static backdrops rather than dynamic forces shaping character or plot; sensory details prioritize aesthetic over thematic function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors present (corn husk as mortality, folds as knowledge) but remain illustrative rather than revelatory; closure feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned through dramatic progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on archetypal "spiritual journey" framework; symbolic elements (origami swan, broken clock) rendered with poetic diction but lack subversive conceptual rigor or emotional specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist without transformative interrelationship; stylish prose compensates for lack of concrete thematic stakes but insufficiently interrogates existential premises.</comment>
