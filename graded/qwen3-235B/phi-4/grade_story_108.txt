<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Purely descriptive traits with no developed psychology; assigned attributes function as arbitrary labels rather than shaping organic behavior or decisions. Character's actions lack internal logic or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Superficial narrative progression; action resolution relies on poetic abstraction rather than causal mechanisms. The arbitrary introduction of a family tradition disrupts plot momentum.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements remain isolated fragments; superficial thematic gestures lack depth. No evidence that brevity serves intentional artistic purpose rather than structural limitation.</comment>
