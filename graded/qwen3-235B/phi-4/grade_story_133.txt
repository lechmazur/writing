<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Main traits stated but not shown; motivation mentioned but poorly demonstrated through actions. Internal thoughts lack depth, interactions rely on vague abstractions rather than concrete behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weak narrative arc; pottery class framework exists but lacks meaningful progression. Symbolic closure about claiming throne feels unearned. Pacing unevenly oscillates between stagnation and abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard conceptually rich but sensory details minimal. Colonial rooftops and pottery class underdeveloped atmospherically. Metaphorical resonance overstated rather than authentically rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Poetic flourishes overshadow emotional substance. Throne/gloves symbolism repetitive rather than layered. Ending leans on clich√©s about legacy rather than revealing character transformation. Central conflict remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Verbal overabundance mistaken for depth - "demure audacity," "whispered secrets" feel decorative rather than organic. Hunting methods mentioned but not meaningfully interrogated. Plot follows trope-like "burdened heir" template without specific nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements awkwardly assembled rather than organically unified. Glossy descriptions compensate for thin narrative mechanics. Conceptual puzzle pieces (throne, gloves, class) never fully connect into cohesive literary machinery.</comment>
