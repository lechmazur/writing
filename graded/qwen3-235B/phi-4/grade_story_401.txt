<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (reconciliation/healing) is conceptually clear but underdeveloped through action; the "wilderness guide" trait lacks integration into his decisions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels static; the ritual and diary-reading lack forward propulsion; the ending’s "transformation" feels unearned due to minimal narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid visual potential (sunken ballroom, oceanic imagery) but underutilizes sensory details beyond sight; tone oscillates between introspective and melodramatic without cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is superficial; metaphors (ring as "pulse," blanket as "lifeline") are over-explained rather than shown; theme of healing lacks depth beyond generic "hope" tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overuses clichéd phrasing ("whirlwind of manic clarity," "profound connection"); the diaries-in-blanket gimmick feels contrived, relying on pseudo-mystical symbolism without innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but shallow; elements serve thematic checkboxes rather than narrative depth; the ending lacks lingering impact, feeling more like a placeholder than a revelation.</comment>
