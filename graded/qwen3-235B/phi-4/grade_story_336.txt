<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (hope in darkness) is clear but thinly developed; actions align with assigned traits but lack emotional depth or meaningful transformation beyond stated resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a vague arc but hinges on abstract concepts rather than concrete narrative momentum; pacing fluctuates between static description and abrupt resolution, undermining cohesion in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are richly rendered with vivid details, though the palace’s connection to character psychology and plot mechanics feels more symbolic than integrally functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor are occasionally effective but often over-explained; theme of hope persists, but emotional resonance is hindered by repetitive abstraction and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on atmospheric clichés (“whispering shadows”) and predictable symbolism; metaphors are derivative, prose verges on purple despite lyrical aspirations, and tone shifts feel formulaic rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists superficially but lacks narrative urgency; elements are incorporated without deep interconnection, resulting in a polished but ultimately hollow execution unworthy of top-tier distinction.</comment>
