<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's death wish and role as poison taster lack psychological depth and direct influence on key decisions. Action-to-motivation linkage feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative has structural cohesion but relies on vague metaphysical explanations. Pacing falters in explaining cause-effect between object, action, and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid moments but setting details (waterfall, ice sculpture) rarely intersect meaningfully with thematic or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical density shows craft, but lacks emotional textureâ€”resolution feels intellectually elegant yet emotionally detached.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some fresh element combinations (radio psychics) undercut by abstract resolution. Treads edge of poetic abstraction vs. narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially integrated but concept-driven; shortness exposes underdeveloped through-lines. Theme remains intellectual rather than experiential.</comment>
