<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies heavily on direct statements rather than demonstrated traits. Motivation lacks depth - the specific connection between "sadly joyful" and the desire to awaken wonder feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The plot is structurally complete but feels schematic. The method (shared cuisine love) is illogically inserted into the haunted house setting without believable integration. Pacing is inconsistent, rushing from setup to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong visual atmosphere with moonlit shadows and creaking floors, but sensory details remain surface-level. The setting's potential to influence emotional states or plot mechanics is underutilized beyond decorative description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some effective imagery ("softly glowing promise of new beginnings") but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Dialogue feels literary rather than natural, and themes are stated rather than explored through narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on multiple genre tropes (haunted houses, underestimated rebels) without subversion. Overuse of abstract descriptors like "ephemeral gloom" and repetitive structure ("The park, once...") suggests formulaic patterns rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The story fulfills technical requirements but lacks cohesive artistic vision. Narrative integration of elements feels checklist-driven rather than organically developed. Some poetic resonance is undermined by structural rigidity and predictable emotional beats.</comment>
