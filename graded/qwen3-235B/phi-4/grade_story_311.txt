<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; "serendipitously stubborn" lacks demonstrated impact on actions. Emotional depth stated more than shown, and bodyguard role feels superficially tied to plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a contemplative arc but lacks narrative propulsion. Transitions are smooth but the collecting-fragments method feels arbitrary, and word-limit constraints expose underdeveloped cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Setting is aesthetically vivid but thematically inert. The lunar greenhouse juxtaposes "serene" tone with sparse, generic sensory language that fails to deepen atmosphere or symbolic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (plants, photograph) are functional but predictable. Emotional impact is diffuse; "serene anger" concept remains abstract rather than shaping narrative or language with distinctive force.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d rebellion tropes with overwritten phrases ("storm of serene anger," "fragments of overheard stories"). Undercuts potential originality through repetitive abstraction rather than character-specific nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Meets assignment requirements but lacks cohesion. Elements like park visits clash with lunar setting, and brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful. Faint thematic echoes but no lingering resonance.</comment>
