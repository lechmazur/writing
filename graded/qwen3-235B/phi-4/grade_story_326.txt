<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara’s "sweetly fierce" demeanor is present but underexplored; her actions align with her motivation to defy genetic limits, but these traits lack nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc and resolution, but pacing feels rushed in spots (e.g., fairy collaboration) and the method (garbled transmissions) strains believability.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but feel imposed rather than organic; ambition is clear, but cohesion falters under high-concept demands.</comment>
