<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Statue's telepathy shapes its passive observation but lacks internal conflict; motivation to find truth is consistent but underdeveloped; emotional expression through static features feels symbolic rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Circular structure (statue observing festival) creates completeness but lacks narrative momentum; cause-effect between telepathy and character interactions remains underexplored; pacing unevenly compresses emotional arcs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Steam-powered details are superficially atmospheric ("melancholic tune") but disconnected from plot; "gloomy cheerfulness" contrasts weakly with festival revelry; sensory details remain vague and inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (calligraphy, hair tie) offer visual resonance but lack thematic payoff; ending resolves too neatly for its introspective tone; "showing" via sensory details is undercut by excessive telling of emotions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Steam-punk elements and telepathy lean on genre tropes; repetitive use of "tragically joyful" borders on self-parody; abstract emotional states replace tangible character reactions; prose veers between lyrical and verbose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist without synergy; tight construction suggests deliberate brevity but sacrifices depth; theme of truth's elusiveness is clear yet underinterrogated; memorable imagery without sustained emotional gravity.</comment>
