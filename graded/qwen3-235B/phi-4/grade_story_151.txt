<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated, motivations lack psychological depth, and moral dilemmas are superficially treated. The astronomer's 'awe' feels imposed rather than organically embodied through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mission-driven arc with symbolic cause-effect logic, but pacing suffers from compressed exposition. The transformation of the idol through 'understanding' lacks tangible narrative progression within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly textured (ice floes, crystal shadows) but inconsistently integrated with thematic elements. The setting's emotional desolation isn't fully leveraged to contrast with the veil's symbolism or the protagonist's analytical drive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual metaphors (snowflakes/complexity, veil/memory) are thought-provoking, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract narration. Some lyrical passages elevate the prose, though thematic resolution feels overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally defaults to poetic abstraction (e.g., 'crystal shadows') without grounding in sensory specificity. The core conceit is original but strained by logical gaps in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole but with uneven emphasis. The brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional, and the central tension between fear and understanding requires deeper dramatization.</comment>
