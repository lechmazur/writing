<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks internal conflict; motivation is stated but not convincingly demonstrated through action or consequence. Personality remains static and largely descriptive rather than dynamically revealed through challenges.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Vague progression; lacks clear rising action or pivotal decisions. Conceptual resolution feels abstract rather than earned through narrative momentum. Pacing uneven within constraints, relying more on poetic repetition than plot development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting elements are vivid but inconsistently utilized - banyan metropolis imagery surfaces sporadically rather than being organically integrated. Phantasmal tone exists primarily in abstract description rather than felt experience through specific details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical structure (dance=life) is clear but lacks narrative tension. Excessive thematic repetition compensates for limited emotional or intellectual subtext. Writing style is lyrical but occasionally veers into self-consciously ornate patterns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Contains formulaic mystical flourishes that feel like genre shorthand rather than fresh invention. Sensory details prioritize poetic abstraction over concreteness. Avoids overt clich√©s but relies too heavily on New Age-style phrasing for emotional impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Struggles to maintain narrative urgency within brief format. Elements appear as decorative checklist items rather than coalescing into unified whole. Conceptually ambitious but execution remains surface-level rather than transforming constraints into creative opportunity.</comment>
