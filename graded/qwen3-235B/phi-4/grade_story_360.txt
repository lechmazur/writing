<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's meekness and sincerity are stated but not deeply demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict; her necromancer identity feels superficially applied rather than integral to solving the riddle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot's three-act structure is present but compressed, leading to abrupt transitions; the dew drop/reflection method feels thematically sound but under-explained within the logic of the world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The goblin city's playful atmosphere clashes with the protagonist's grave quest; sensory details (color spectra, playground sounds) are evocative but inconsistently prioritized for immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (light/tapestry) are conceptually rich but lack emotional resonance; the story's mystic simplicity leans toward abstraction over meaningful subtext or tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some clich√©s persist (ancient riddles, symbolic light) but the broken-nib motif shows ingenuity; uneven tone shifts between lyrical descriptions and flat philosophical assertions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but rarely synergistic; the short form feels like a constraint rather than an asset, leaving thematic exploration shallow.</comment>
