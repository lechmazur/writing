<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but formulaic, relying on contrived road closure as a catalyst; resolution ties together loosely, lacking tension or memorable stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but atmospheric details occasionally lean into ornate description rather than deepening character or theme; layered tranquility is hinted but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and imagery purposefully (e.g., pearls as transformation), but emotional resonance is hindered by occasional abstraction; ending closes with thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on familiar arc (self-doubt to empowerment) without subverting expectations; prose wavers between lyrical and overwrought, risking purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but lacks urgency or innovation; elements fit together decently yet lack transformative interplay; memorable only in isolated moments.</comment>
