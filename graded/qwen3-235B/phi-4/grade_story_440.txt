<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through actions. Detached swordsman traits feel superficially applied without meaningful influence on behavior or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is repetitive with static pacing. Connection between beginning/end weak; the story feels more like a sequence of descriptions than a coherent narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting offers minimal atmosphere. Futuristic recycling center lacks immersive sensory details and meaningful integration with the sea-related elements or overall theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story relies heavily on exposition rather than showing. Symbolism is shallow; emotional resonance minimal. Ending feels perfunctory without meaningful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (mystical secret societies, redemptive artifacts) dominate. Prose occasionally veers into flowery abstraction without concrete imagery. Lacks original voice or subversive take on elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist without synergy. Story feels like a checklist of assigned components rather than an organic creation. Style prioritizes vague lyricism over narrative clarity or emotional authenticity.</comment>
