<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character is overly abstract and defined by poetic metaphors rather than concrete motivations or actions; passivity is stated but not demonstrated through meaningful choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot exists as a vague arc of self-discovery but lacks conflict, concrete progression, or cause-effect logic; structure feels like a loosely connected series of poetic observations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting (quantum foam) is underdeveloped and inconsistently integrated; lacks specific sensory details or atmospheric cohesion to ground the surreal elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Relies heavily on clich√©d metaphors ("buried optimism," "lines drawn by fear") and overly ornate abstractions rather than visceral storytelling or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Predictable thematic scaffolding and repetitive phrasing ("drift of desert sands") suggest algorithmic pattern repetition rather than organic innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements feel artificially assembled; abstract language and thematic redundancy undermine cohesion despite ambitious thematic intentions.</comment>
