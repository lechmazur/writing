<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth; muteness serves little functional purpose beyond superficial mystique. Motivation stated but never dramatized through conflicting desires or personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Static progression despite cosmic stakes; clear beginning/end loop but lacks intermediate tension. Plot relies on passive observation over active pursuit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmospherically immersive through tactile details, but underutilizes setting's symbolic potential. Snow and decay enrich mood but seldom influence action or character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually poetic but emotionally inert; metaphors (comet as guide, guide as key) lack thematic complication. Ending provides closure without earned significance or lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Relies on well-worn fantasy motifs (decaying opera houses, cosmic signifiers) without subversion. Prose leans on ornamental abstraction rather than sensory specificity to feign depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but tenuously integrated; setting and object function more as aesthetic props than narrative drivers. Conceptual framework overrides organic character or thematic development.</comment>
