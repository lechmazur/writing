<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elara's reincarnation as a goldfish caretaker remains underexplored; her "tentatively fierce" trait lacks consistent manifestation through specific actions, while her guilt-driven motivation only partially aligns with her character arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect progression exists but feels compressed; the chance encounter catalyzing transformation is reasonable yet underdeveloped, making the narrative arc feel abbreviated within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains predictable emotional beats and metaphors; the "broken object = internal struggle" device lacks sufficient subversion, while tonal inconsistencies mar otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative but lack innovative integration; the brief length feels structurally adequate but insufficient for fully exploring multiple assigned components' potential.</comment>
