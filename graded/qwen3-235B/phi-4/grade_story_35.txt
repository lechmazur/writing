<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's quiet nature is consistent but underexplored; motivation for emotional understanding feels somewhat abstract and underdeveloped despite the retreat backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to revelation, but pacing feels rushed in the word limit; the garden's symbolism as "living testament" lacks sufficient build-up for emotional impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from vivid gardening details and bird calls, but the Universal Translation Center's futuristic context remains poorly integrated, weakening thematic cohesion with "language of emotions."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor (fireflies as words, garden as emotion) create resonance, but the ending's epiphany borders on cliché; theme of "felt vs. translated emotions" is clear yet lacks subversive nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors ("symphony of shared silences"), but reliance on familiar silent-retreat trope and vague descriptors like "improbable longing" undermine originality; emotional resonance leans overly on poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but unremarkable; elements are utilized with minimal creativity, and its brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; fails to transcend AI-writing clichés of flowery introspection without distinct authorial voice.</comment>
