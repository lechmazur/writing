<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks distinct voice; "grudgingly sweet" not clearly manifested in actions or dialogue. Motivation to "hush regret" is abstract, inconsistent with specific behaviors shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Arc is complete but structurally compressed. Internal revelations dominate external plot momentum. Pacing prioritizes symbolic imagery over narrative progression; final knock feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lighthouse's symbolic duality is strong, but sensory immersion limited. Jagged reef underutilized beyond visual descriptors. Atmosphere supports theme but lacks tactile/auditory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (compass/truth) effective but over-explained. Theme of self-forgiveness resonates, yet emotional beats stated rather than shown. Ending achieves closure but lacks surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Purple prose ("joyful agony," "final cry") leans on abstract duality tropes. Overly ornate phrasing ("weatherbeaten," "turbulent sea") weakens impact. Sensory details often generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through repetitive symbolic motifs, but story relies heavily on preassigned elements as narrative crutches. Thematic resonance is clear yet surface-level.</comment>
