<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stated traits (blameless, logically emotional) remain superficial labels; internal conflict and character voice lack depth beyond poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves logically through tunnels but lacks rising tension; the "final countdown" feels underutilized, and the resolution appears abrupt despite clear thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Over-reliance on generic gothic tropes (echoes, labyrinths) without original sensory specificity; atmosphere veers toward clich√© rather than immersive distinctiveness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery avoids overt purple prose but occasionally strains toward preciousness; emotional logic feels genuine despite faint echoes of formulaic introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as narrative scaffolding rather than organic components; story lacks sufficient emotional or structural cohesion to transcend checklist-driven construction.</comment>
