<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Barely scratches surface of dropout background; motivations stated rather than embodied through action; rosebud remains symbolic placeholder rather than integral character mirror; lacks distinct narrative voice to deepen psychological realism</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot moves predictably toward foregone conclusion; method lacks logical connection to concept; compressed arc feels artificially imposed rather than organically earned; cause-effect relationships mostly superficial</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Permeated by purple prose and clich√©d fantasy tropes; repetitive "echo" motifs; stilted attempts at emotional weight; generic terms like "fractured reality" suggest conceptual laziness; pacing lurches between extremes</comment>
