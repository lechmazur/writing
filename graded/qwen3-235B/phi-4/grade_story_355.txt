<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aloofness shapes her actions but lacks depth; motivations are hinted at rather than fully explained or nuanced. Emotional stakes remain superficial despite poetic descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coherent arc but uneven pacing; the transformation feels abrupt under word constraints. Cause and effect logically connected but emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details establish atmosphere, but relies on clich√©d tropes like "whispers of the past." Setting enhances mood but lacks unique spatial or temporal grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Uses symbolism effectively (compass, letters) but leans on stated emotions. Ending is thematically satisfying but too tidy; lacks visceral impact or lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some lyrical moments undercut by repetitive adjectives ("swirling colors," "forgotten dreams"). Motifs like "scattered dreams" feel contrived; emotional resonance is more aspirational than achieved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>Elements are cohesively arranged but not transformative; style elevates theme without breaking molds. Leaves minimal lingering impact beyond surface-level thematic closure.</comment>
