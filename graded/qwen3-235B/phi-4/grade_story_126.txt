<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains cryptically symbolic rather than psychologically vivid; motivation is stated rather than dramatized through concrete actions or decisions that reveal interiority. Aloof passion feels inconsistently embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a conceptual arc but feels compressed; the poster-as-ladder method strains credibility within the setting's logic; beginning and end resonate thematically but pivotal moments lack developmental weight due to brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay is evocatively rendered (peeling posters, cold metal), but space station's connection to Earth's ecological collapse feels underdeveloped; sensory details are effective but unevenly distributed, leaving some elements (e.g., butter churn's texture) under-imagined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (churn as rebellion) and cosmic metaphor work powerfully but risk abstraction; the ending's philosophical declaration undersells emotional immediacy; writing style balances lyricism with restraint but occasionally drifts into vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cosmic rebellion motif avoids clich√©, but "honestly strange" churn and "aloof passion" feel undercontextualized; some descriptors ("rebellious sparks") lean on familiar phrasing; originality peaks in object-setting juxtaposition but falters in tonal consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements combine thematically but unevenly; story leans on concept rather than lived-in narrative; constrained form works for symbolic brevity but sacrifices emotional nuance; central idea resonates but execution lacks distinctive stylistic authority.</comment>
