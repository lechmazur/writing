<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Characters serve thematic purposes but lack layered motivations; Eamon's cynically hopeful nature is stated rather than deeply embodied through actions; interactions with assigned elements feel partially superficial despite narrative significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing struggles within tight constraints—beginning (drone malfunction) and end (uniting at orchard's fall) connect thematically but pivotal encounters (speed dating) lack organic buildup; plot progression feels condensed rather than deliberately structured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting blends medieval and anachronistic elements (speed dating) without resolving tonal dissonance; "charred serenity" is conceptually referenced but underexplored through sensory details; objects like the herb bundle receive more atmospheric integration than locations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of hope/legacy resonate, but emotional weight relies partially on exposition over immersive subtext; recurring symbols (stars, herbs) offer cohesion, while dialogue-heavy character moments dilute impact; ending feels earnest but overly tidy for a 10.0.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Medieval drone pilot and speed dating event telegraph artificial construction; metaphors ("horizons of mercy") and descriptors ("charred serenity") veer toward cliché; character reasoning (Eamon's rapid purposefulness) lacks messy human nuance; purple prose avoids overt excess but remains occasionally flowery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist without transforming each other; the observatory and herb bundle add texture but aren't narrative linchpins; brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional; theme of bridging worlds offers mild ingenuity but lacks subversive bite.</comment>
