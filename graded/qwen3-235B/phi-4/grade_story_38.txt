<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are abstract rather than deeply explored; poet's insomnia and yearning for non-violence lack psychological depth. Actions and traits don't coalesce into a fully realized persona. First-person narration feels generic rather than distinctive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear structure links attic meditation to revelation, but transitions between scenes (subway stops, after-parties) feel episodic rather than causally connected. Pacing alternates between languid description and abrupt revelations, slightly undermining momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative details like "scent of old paper" and "haunted attic" effectively establish mood, but the "empty abundance" tone inconsistently interacts with the poet's active quest. Botanical samples function more as symbols than integrated physical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphors about whispers and botanical secrets create surface-level thematic resonance, but the ending's uplift feels unearned. Themes are underdeveloped; emotional impact relies too heavily on declarative statements rather than layered subtext or character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Relies on poetic mysticism tropes (whispering nature, haunted spaces) without subversion. Overuses vague, ethereal language ("whispers," "echoes") that borders on cliché. Some atmospheric details are vivid, but overall voice lacks distinctive stylistic control or risk-taking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Intriguing ideas undermined by underdeveloped connections between elements. Botanical samples and attic atmosphere stand out, but the poet’s subway-stop timeline and party confessions feel disconnected. Core theme of non-violence through understanding is conceptually sound but narratively thin.</comment>
