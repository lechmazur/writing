<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; abstract motivation lacks visceral grounding. Actions inconsistently embody "methodically random."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Functional coherence with all elements present, but thematic resonance remains superficial despite lyrical execution.</comment>
