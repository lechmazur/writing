<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations feel stated rather than demonstrated through internal conflict or evolving actions. The cyber-templar identity isn’t fully integrated into her behaviors or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed. The action’s method (refracting lightning) is under-explained, causing logical gaps. Pacing sacrifices tension for brevity, with abrupt transitions between setup and climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually striking but thin. The sky burial site’s hybrid tech/spiritual elements hint at depth but aren’t expanded. Sensory details are sparse, leaving the setting more symbolic than tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Themes of control vs. chaos are surface-level. Metaphors (e.g., light refraction as defiance) lack layered execution. Ending feels declarative rather than earned, with minimal emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on overused sci-fi/fantasy tropes (stargazing messiahs, mystical artifacts). Purple prose (“serpent-like beams,” “symphony of hope and fear”) undercuts authenticity. Character reasoning feels programmatically logical rather than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren’t tightly intertwined. The premise shows ambition but sacrifices nuance for brevity. The ending lacks thematic punch, and the story’s ambition outpaces its execution.</comment>
