<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; "aggressively kind" is stated but not demonstrated. Motivation to rescue traditions lacks emotional depth or concrete backstory. Actions (flinging whistle) don't clearly connect to personal stakes or traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot structure superficially complete but rushed. Assigned action (fling) and concept (rescue traditions) lack cohesive cause/effect. Sudden transitions between lighthouse and dancer weaken coherence. Pacing uneven despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting offers promising atmosphere (haunted lighthouse, whale's call) but underdeveloped. Sensory details (e.g., sea whispers) effective but sporadic. Tone ("brazen calm") inconsistently applied; atmosphere doesn't fully mirror character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose lacks emotional authenticity; relies on abstract phrases like "undercurrent of wisdom" rather than visceral imagery. Themes of tradition preservation hinted at but shallowly explored. Ending feels contrived, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Formulaic combinations (haunted lighthouse, whale symbolism) feel derivative without subversion. Overuse of poetic clich√©s ("dance of its own") and imprecise descriptors ("brazen calm"). Subtext minimal; emotions often stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated. Excessive focus on ornamental language overshadows narrative cohesion. Short length exacerbates underdevelopment. Central theme lacks resonance; fails to provoke lasting reflection despite effortful symbolism.</comment>
