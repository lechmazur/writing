<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks internal conflict; motivation remains abstract rather than visceral, with inconsistent manifestation of "lethargically energetic" trait. Symbolism outweighs psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows circular logic rather than progression; the ember concept resolves too neatly without earned tension. Pacing undulates between stagnant and abrupt within constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in the acid rain forest creates haunting, cohesive atmosphere. Decay and resilience motifs permeate setting details effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., puzzle pieces as choices) elevate theme, but emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral. Ending lacks narrative surprise while delivering conceptual closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>Elements coexist thematically but lack mechanical cohesion; premise feels conceptually ambitious yet narratively undercooked for prestigious-tier standards.</comment>
