<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior. "Bright-eyed apprentice" trope remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels rushed. Key plot points (overcharging console) lack technical or emotional buildup within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere hints at eeriness but relies on generic descriptors. Sensory details underdeveloped compared to potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Surface-level themes of hope; lacks subtext or complex emotional resonance. Ending feels formulaically triumphant without earned payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on sci-fi/fantasy tropes (haunted lighthouses, ancient maps) without subversion. Language occasionally veers into vague description rather than precise imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements function but lack cohesion. Brief length highlights narrative gaps rather than showcasing deliberate compression.</comment>
