<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character lacks consistent voice or psychological depth; phobias as vague backdrop, motivation to "dance on edge of madness" asserted but not dramatized through specific actions or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fragmented pacing disrupts narrative flow - transitions between garage sales, pyramid, and epiphany feel arbitrary; climax lacks emotional payoff; resolution feels imposed rather than earned through plotted action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting functions as symbolic placeholder rather than vivid environment - pyramid library's visual details are generic, atmosphere relies on clichéd "labyrinth" tropes; sensory immersion undercut by abstract descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on "show don't tell" violations - emotions stated rather than dramatized; metaphor of knots/unraveling feels over-explained; theme of fear confrontation lacks nuanced subtext; ending preachifies rather than resonates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on mystical clichés (echoes, labyrinths, spiritual awakenings) without subversion; repetitive phrasing patterns ("echoes in the dark", "mundanely spiritual"); emotional beats follow predictable algorithmic cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mixed cohesion - elements present but loosely aggregated; metaphors function mechanically rather than organically; brevity works against depth but not leveraged into poetic impact; thematic takeaway feels generic.</comment>
