<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action. Surly nature remains superficial, unconnected to behaviors or worldview.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum or narrative arc - merely circles static ritual. Events don't build meaningfully toward resolution; circular structure weakens impact rather than enhancing it.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with vivid sensory details that create emotional resonance and thematic coherence. Sailor's graveyard setting and cyclical timeframe enhance meditative tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery and cosmic symbolism are effective but surface-level. Ending avoids sentimentality but feels underdeveloped rather than intentionally ambiguous. Emotional restraint borders on detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</comment>Relies heavily on clich√©d poetic devices, repetitive phrasing ("serenely frantic", "dignified chaos"), and abstract conceptualization without concrete manifestation. Writing feels like self-consciously "literary" pastiche.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely connected. Formal craftsmanship evident in prose but lacks thematic urgency or conceptual innovation. Vignette-like structure feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>
