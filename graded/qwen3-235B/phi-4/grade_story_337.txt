<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains thinly developed; "reliably unreliable" trait isn't meaningfully demonstrated through actions. Motivation feels imposed rather than organically revealed, lacking emotional depth or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum; static descriptions outweigh narrative progression. Arc is artificially imposed rather than earned through character decisions. Pacing drags despite tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Visual atmosphere is strong but other senses are neglected. Setting elements exist decoratively rather than interacting with plot/character. Timeframe concept is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Inconsistent emotional impact; some poetic language present but lacks genuine resonance. Subtext about tradition/innovation is superficially treated. No cohesive theme emerges from elements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Abundance of clich√©d phrases ("whispers of stories untold") and generic metaphors. Predictable contrasts between past/present. Sentences often feel labored without distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist without meaningful synergy. Story feels constrained by assignment rather than liberated by it. Ending fails to provoke deeper reflection or emotional payoff.</comment>
