<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through action. Zealotry feels performative rather than organically developed. Emotional arc feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative dissolves into vague abstractions; pivotal action (uprooting bottle cap) lacks tangible consequences. Plot progression veers toward thematic meandering rather than structured causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details unevenly applied; candlelight and jungle sounds create atmosphere, but Victorian parlor's physicality and temporal dissonance remain underexplored. Tonal incongruity undermines setting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Symbols (bottle cap, parlor) gestured toward rather than integrated. Conclusion offers platitudes rather than emotional catharsis. Over-reliance on declarative statements weakens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Rampant "purple prose" evident in excessive adjectives, clich√©d metaphors ("dance of shadows"), and abstract sentimentality. Writing style prioritizes ornamentation over revelatory specificity or subversive innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements superficially present but haphazardly assembled. Story prioritizes aesthetic affectation over narrative momentum or philosophical depth. Fails to transcend genre tropes in either concept or execution.</comment>
