<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but remains static; internal motivation exists thematically rather than through behavioral logic, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meandering structure lacks narrative propulsion; ritualistic actions substitute for plot development but create a sense of ritual over dramatic progression within strict word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (fungi, bells) create mood but remain superficial; atmospheric potential exceeds functional integration with character or plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration appears checklist-driven rather than organically fused; promising conceptual framework outpaces execution in balancing multiple narrative requirements.</comment>
