<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character lacks sufficient nuance; while motivation is clear and consistent with actions, the 'faux fortune teller' aspect isn't fully exploited to add depth or complexity to her choices and internal conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has coherent structure with clear arc, but pacing and transitions feel uneven, particularly the sudden shift to the garden. Cause-effect relationships evident but occasionally simplistic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere successfully merges urban and ancient elements, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid. The garden's symbolic role is strong, yet the 'extinct language archive' setting isn't meaningfully exploited beyond surface-level intrigue.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (flute as divine bridge) and thematic exploration of sacred development. Emotional resonance is mild; resolution satisfactory but lacking transformative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blends mystical tropes with urban fantasy, but lacks subversion of clich√©s. Some purple prose ('peaceful anger') and generic descriptors dilute originality. Emotional states occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but inconsistently integrated. The compact format allows efficient storytelling, but thematic depth feels truncated. Some creative combinations evident, but execution lacks cutting-edge innovation.</comment>
