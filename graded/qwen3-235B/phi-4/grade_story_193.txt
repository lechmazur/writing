<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prince's motivation to cure loneliness is clear but lacks emotional depth; his exile isn't meaningfully connected to his actions beyond surface-level symbolism. The mortar and pestle's significance feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has circular structure (storm opens/closes) but progression feels engineered rather than organic; sudden transitions between scenes reduce emotional impact despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create mood, but the abandoned customs office's potential as a symbolic space is underutilized; snowstorm's connection to "unseen forces" remains vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection through hardship resonates, and the mortar/pestle serves as effective motif; ending relies on explicit thematic statement rather than earned realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids being overtly clich√©d through specific imagery but falls into "healing through journey" tropes; language occasionally veers into overwritten descriptions rather than purposeful precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack integration; compressed format highlights narrative shortcuts; emotional resonance is diluted by reliance on familiar arc progression.</comment>
