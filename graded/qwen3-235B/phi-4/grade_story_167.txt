<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's determination is clear but underexplored; motivations lack psychological nuance despite aligning with her "dutiful scholar" trait. Her use of the coil and well echoes feels conceptually sound but emotionally detached.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from premise to resolution within constraints, but the pivotal contamination scene lacks visceral tension. The arc is cohesive yet feels abbreviated, sacrificing depth for brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The capsule hotel's temporal energy and the well's haunted resonance create atmosphere, but sensory details remain sparse. The setting's potential as a nexus of time travel isn't fully leveraged to deepen the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery ("symphony of time and memory") and the theme of silenced histories resonate, though emotional weight is undercut by abstract phrasing. The ending is satisfyingly cyclical but lacks concrete impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like the coil and well avoid strict formula but flirt with time-travel tropes. The prose is lyrical yet occasionally drifts into purple prose ("earthbound flight"); emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but occasionally feel schematic. The story's brevity amplifies its poetic qualities while constraining narrative depth; the concept lingers but lacks narrative grit.</comment>
