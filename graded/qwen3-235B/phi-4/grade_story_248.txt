<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is abstract; "unsteady" quality lacks depth or personal stakes. Reactions to automaton bird don't reveal substantial inner complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Basic structure exists but lacks coherent progression. Plot resolution feels abrupt, with colliding worlds having little buildup or logical connection to prophetic revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Surface-level descriptions without immersive sensory details. Atmosphere attempts mysterious tone but setting doesn't significantly shape character actions or thematic content.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overused themes of prophecy and fate without fresh perspective. Writing style veers into cliche with heavy reliance on abstract descriptors rather than evocative storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Pervasive formulaic structure: repetitive phrasing, sudden narrative shifts, and overly precise yet vague descriptions suggest algorithmic composition rather than organic creation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements included but mostly serve checklist requirements. Story lacks distinctive voice or emotional resonance that would justify its form or leave lasting impact.</comment>
