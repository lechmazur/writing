<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Seasickness underutilized; motivation stated but undershown; "awkwardly charming" inconsistently manifested. Flashbacks to scholars/mystics add depth but lack specific behavioral linkage.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Crystal fortress climax disjointed from moon phase method; resolution feels abrupt despite cyclical timeframe; cause-effect between bulb shattering and mirror's transformation lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal glow of ghost orchid masterfully contrasts with fortress' crystalline coldness; sensory details (shimmering walls, whispered secrets) create tangible nostalgia but timeframe dilutes temporal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mirror's subversion of reflection trope carries existential weight; transformation scene memorable but emotional payoff weakened by over-reliance on told introspection; theme of confronting illusion vs. truth compellingly sustained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but "quiet longing of centuries" and rainbow canyon verge on romanticized vagueness; mirror confrontation shows ingenuity but moon phase mechanics feel like checklist worldbuilding; emotional shifts occasionally told rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion despite uneven thematic integration; prescribed elements function but lack symbiotic innovation; ending achieves closure without fully transcending expected transformation arc.</comment>
