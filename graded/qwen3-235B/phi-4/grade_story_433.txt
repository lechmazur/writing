<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara’s hardheadedness and brokenness shape her actions but lack nuanced inner conflict; her transformation feels abrupt. Demure audacity is stated but not fully embodied in decisions or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed; the connection between opening the safe and her redemption is underdeveloped, with abrupt thematic leaps. Pacing struggles within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The ephemeral gallery and snow-draped city create a stark, transient atmosphere. Sensory details are present but unevenly distributed; the setting mirrors themes but lacks immersive depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence and redemption are hinted at, but emotional resonance is dulled by expository introspection. The ending resolves neatly but lacks visceral impact from “showing” rather than “telling.”</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd tropes (prophecy scraps, soul-searching traveler). Overly ornate language and abstract emotional beats undermine authenticity; moments of subtlety are overshadowed by formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack cohesive innovation. The story’s brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional, with unresolved tension between thematic ambition and concise execution.</comment>
