<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's internal struggles are present but feel abstract rather than deeply visceral; motivations tied to regret and memory are consistent but lack nuanced psychological grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Structure is coherent but pacing falters—key emotional beats rush while atmospheric descriptions linger unnecessarily; the suitcase as closure device feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Evocative machinery sounds contrast with introspection, but the postal facility’s thematic ties to "discarded" lives remain underdeveloped; sensory details lack immersive specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (music, pens, suitcases) create resonance, but the ending’s uplift feels slightly pat; the tension between memory and acceptance is well-integrated yet leans on sentimental phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in merging postal automation with forgotten human stories is strong, but phrases like “joyful despair” and “resilience of the human spirit” risk cliché; emotional subtext could be more subtly shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere reasonably but unevenly—thematic strands (regret, memory) are clear, but story’s brevity leaves some assigned components underutilized; style leans occasionally toward affective vagueness.</comment>
