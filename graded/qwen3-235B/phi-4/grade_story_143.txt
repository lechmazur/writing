<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fidgetiness and magical craftsmanship are surface traits rather than defining motivations. Musically untalented element feels arbitrarily inserted, not influencing actions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from planting to transformation, but pivotal moments lack emotional weight. Arc exists within word limit but feels perfunctory rather than inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lavender/rust contrast creates memorable atmosphere. Sensory details effectively immerse but setting remains backdrop rather than active narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Makes thematic gestures toward order/chaos but relies on stated emotions. Some striking imagery (keys glowing, "chaos tamed") but lacks subtext complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Anchors in elemental contrasts but contains overly formulaic phrases ("tapestry of fear and joy," "chaotic ballet"). Symbolism feels more decorative than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combined cohesively but without surprising alchemy. Short form serves practical rather than artistic purpose. Lingering impact is mild.</comment>
