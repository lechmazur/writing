<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are abstractly stated but not psychologically nuanced. Assigned attribute (smiling) doesn't significantly shape actions beyond surface-level paradox.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear ascent but lacks concrete stakes or consequence for the "progress." The action's connection to mannequins and star's wrath feels arbitrary rather than causally driven within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but atmospheric elements clash; "angry peace" tone isn't fully internalized through sensory details. The tower's decay is described but not emotionally inhabited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Themes of imperfection are told, not shown through character transformation. Over-reliance on metaphoric abstraction (e.g., "tapestry") dilutes emotional impact. Ending feels contrived, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some overwrought prose ("echoing in the saboteur's mind") and generic descriptors ("warm glow"). The central metaphor (tower as imperfection) lacks specificity to transcend clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesion suffers under the weight of assigned elements. The story prioritizes concept listing over organic narrative flow, making the tight length feel restrictive rather than intentional.</comment>
