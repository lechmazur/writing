<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are surface-level; motivation feels tacked on rather than organically tied to actions. Emotional depth lacks complexity beyond stated descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thin progression between plot points; lacks tension/resolution structure. Pacing uneven but mostly coherent within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but overly reliant on clich√©d decay tropes (e.g., "ruins," "tarnished"). Sensory details present but generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery, but resolution feels artificially imposed. Central conflict muddied by excessive thematic exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Formulaic metaphors ("canvas for dreams") and predictable decay-beauty arc reduce originality. Language occasionally veers toward purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements combine mechanically rather than organically. Lacks lingering resonance beyond surface-level thematic statements.</comment>
