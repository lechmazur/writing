<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation for freedom is clear but underdeveloped; transformation from caution to confidence lacks nuance, though the rosary's symbolic role ties her arc to tangible action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels rushed; cause-and-effect connections exist, yet the desert fortress's significance to the climax remains underexplored within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting establishes mood but leans on familiar desert imagery; sensory details about the fortress's serpent-like design and sand art are sparse, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (rosary, sand art) adds depth; ending delivers thematic resonance about freedom and connection, but emotional beats rely partly on telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally defaults to predictable arcs (transformation, community-driven change); prose remains purposeful yet lacks stylistic distinctness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements like the rosary and mapping cultural patterns serve the story, but the fortress's design and "ordered disarray" tone feel superficially integrated, diluting cohesion.</comment>
