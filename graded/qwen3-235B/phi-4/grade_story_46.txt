<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character lacks inner conflict or emotional depth; motivations are abstractly stated rather than concretely demonstrated through actions or decisions. "Uniquely typical" fails to generate meaningful personality traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lacks discernible narrative arc; begins and ends with identical actions and imagery without meaningful progression. Moon paths as plot device remain unconnected to actual plot developments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ferns, waterfalls) create strong visual atmosphere, but environmental elements don't interact meaningfully with character's stated motivations or symbolic objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies on stated themes rather than organic exploration; ending merely repeats opening premise without revelation. Heavy use of metaphor strains credibility through abstraction rather than emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids direct clich√©s but falls into patterned AI-writing rhythms: excessive abstraction, recursive metaphors, and thematic overstatement. Conceptual originality is undermined by conventional descriptive techniques.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than interwoven; word count limitation highlights structural fragility. Attempts poetic resonance but lacks concrete emotional or narrative payoffs.</comment>
