<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable symbolic arc (DVD activation → neon pulse → existential affirmation) but struggles with temporal compression; emotional beats feel underdeveloped due to structural rigidity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The "fairy light repair shop" evokes visual atmosphere but underutilizes sensory details; neon glow creates mood but fails to integrate tactile/smell elements that would deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Aesthetic cohesion exists but remains superficial; elements function as checklist items rather than organic components; thematic closure feels perfunctory rather than revelatory.</comment>
