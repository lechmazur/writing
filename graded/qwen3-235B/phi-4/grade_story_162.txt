<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Leo's gambling nature is peripheral, with motivations feeling stated rather than organically integrated. Reactions to the blueprint lack psychological depth, and his voice remains generic despite introspective narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blueprint fragment drives movement between present and memory, but transitions feel abrupt. The arc culminates in resolved peace, though the middle lacks narrative tension. Pacing balances reflection and action unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Echoing "hammered repose" and "hush" set mood, but island descriptions rely on clich√©d sensory tropes. Workshop clutter mirrors inner chaos but lacks specific, transformative details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (blueprint as emotional map) are poetic but overexplained. Emotional impact remains surface-level; themes of harmony/chaos are clear but lack layered subtext or fresh perspective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Overused phrases ("sunsets painted gold," "whispers secrets") undercut originality. Reverse engineering is underexploited conceptually; character reasoning feels logical but emotionally flat.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot feels stretched by brevity constraints. Elements are conceptually linked but unevenly realized, with potential undercut by predictable emotional beats and stylistic overwriting.</comment>
