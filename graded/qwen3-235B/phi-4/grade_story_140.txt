<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivations implied through generic descriptors rather than nuanced behavior; transformation feels abrupt without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a basic redemption arc but loses momentum during the planetarium backstory; abrupt shift from memory to present weakens dramatic tension within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Suffocating atmosphere established through limited sensory details; setting serves as Gothic backdrop but underutilizes circus-specific elements to deepen narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Borrowed metaphors lack freshness; the doll's symbolism is conceptually sound but executed predictably; emotional peaks rely on adverb-laden declarations rather than organic subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing competes with substance; reliance on "dark redemption" tropes without subversion; internal logic occasionally strains under verbose abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Element integration uneven; some (doll, dawn timeframe) work cohesively while others (planetarium episode) feel contrived; thematic ambition outweighs execution.</comment>
