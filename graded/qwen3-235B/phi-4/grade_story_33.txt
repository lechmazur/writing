<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's anxiously relaxed state is present but inconsistently woven into her actions; her motivation for asserting cosmic chaos lacks emotional grounding despite symbolic references to nonviolence and transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks forward momentum; abstract internal shifts dominate, creating a sense of stasis; cause-and-effect between elements like the mask, office, and cosmic blink remains vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting details (scent of leaves, marble floor) are present but generic; atmosphere relies on poetic phrases like "braided bitterness" without visceral immersion; object-setting connection feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of chaos/order and nonviolence emerge through metaphors, but emotional resonance is muted by over-reliance on abstractions; ending circles without delivering satisfying change or revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abstract concepts and lyrical language border on purple prose; while non-formulaic in subject, repetitive thematic statements and disconnected metaphors undercut originality and tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack tight cohesion; the story leans heavily on symbolic weight without earning emotional stakes, leaving themes feeling underdeveloped despite poetic ambition.</comment>
