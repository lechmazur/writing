<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are abstract and inconsistently tied to actions. "Carefully careless" trait is stated but insufficiently demonstrated through behavior, and the character's introspection feels generic rather than revealing human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot is atmospheric but structurally loose, relying on mood rather than momentum. The blood drive method creates a jarring, unexplained narrative leap. Pacing works for introspection but lacks clear cause-and-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in the haunted mansion setting evoke mood effectively. The "bleeding" timeframe reinforces the eerie atmosphere. Botanical collection and mansion integrate well, though the thematic connection could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "color bled from day into night") and subtext about power dynamics are memorable. The ending loops back thematically but feels emotionally hollow. Tension between seen/unseen remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Relies on haunted mansion and botanical mystery tropes without subverting them. Occasionally descends into overly ornate phrasing ("walls holding centuries of untold stories"). Emotions are often told (e.g., "felt the weight") rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the mansion and botanical collection work well, but the blood drive and silent agreements feel shoehorned. Tone is consistent, but the story sacrifices narrative cohesion for atmospheric writing.</comment>
