<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear motivation and emotional resonance, but the ghost whisperer ability feels superficially integrated. Assigned attributes shape emotional tone more than concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc with effective beginning/middle/end structure, though pacing slightly rushed in sections. Assigned action and concept drive progression with mostly logical cause-and-effect, weakened by overly convenient treasure revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through decaying carnival elements is evocative but underdeveloped. Sensory details unevenly distributed; tone partially complements melancholic/rebirth themes but lacks distinctive environmental personality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of self-discovery resonate emotionally, though surface-level delivery. Effective symbolism with amber/treasure but limited subtextual complexity; ending emotionally satisfying while remaining somewhat conventional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Contains fresh character elements overshadowed by reliance on redemption tropes. Some purple prose and generic descriptors; emotional nuance partially present but undercut by explanatory overstatement. Voice remains stylistically consistent but derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements incorporated with moderate success; cohesive enough for short form but lacks narrative density. Brief length exposes underdeveloped connections between components; establishes atmospheric impression over structural innovation.</comment>
