<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but superficially rendered; shattered allegiances and desire to master time lack psychological depth despite consistent alignment with traits. "Proud humility" feels stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arc within tight limits, but key action mechanics (harp-guided navigation, chip retrieval) lack explanation. Coherence suffers from underdeveloped cause-effect chains and compressed pacing that flattens tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting provides atmospheric novelty through contrasting cyberpunk elements but fails to integrate sensory details meaningfully. "Electronic wilderness" concept remains more metaphorical than immersive, with inconsistent tonal alignment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and temporal themes offer conceptual resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy exposition. Metaphorical potential of time mastery is unevenly developed; ending achieves thematic symmetry but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality diluted by genre tropes (lone hacker seeking power, betrayal arcs). Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("misaligned harp," "shimmer with potential") veers into purple prose. Subtext remains surface-level despite attempts at existential inquiry.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of assigned elements that never transcends checklist fulfillment. Story structure exists primarily to showcase prompts rather than organically serve theme or character. Lingering impression of technical execution over artistic vision.</comment>
