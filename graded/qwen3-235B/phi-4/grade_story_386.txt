<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Elyra’s defiance feels stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or conflicts; her temporal refugee status lacks visceral emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear arc but struggles with the word limit; catapult climax feels abrupt, and the connection between star alignment and the act could be more tightly woven; pacing works mechanically but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (e.g., "borrowed dawn") but inconsistently sustained; sensory details are sparse beyond visual elements; the lighthouse’s atomic power and celestial setting remain conceptually underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (tablecloth, lighthouse) enhances thematic cohesion; emotional resonance is mild but present; ending circles back effectively but could deepen the "unstoppable will" motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality in the catapult and atomic lighthouse juxtaposes with clichéd tropes (forgotten empires, star-aligned magic); prose occasionally veers into purple territory but avoids full formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; the lighthouse and tablecloth drive momentum, while other elements (e.g., "hush of a line") feel decorative; story shows ambition but lacks polish.</comment>
