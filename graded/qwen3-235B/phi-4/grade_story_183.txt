<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than fully realized; stated motivations lack personal stakes or concrete backstory. Reactions to the hat box reveal thematic intent but lack emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear metaphorical arc but relies on conceptual abstraction over causal logic. Pacing balances mystery and revelation well within constraints but lacks tension or pivotal stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Intensely quiet atmosphere is vividly maintained through sensory details (silence, shimmering tiles, heartbeats). The abandoned theatre and dimensional rift create a haunting, immersive setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echoes of "language as journey" resonate metaphorically. Prose is poetic yet accessible, balancing introspective themes with visceral imagery. Ending satisfies as a thematic revelation but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic patterns but occasionally leans on familiar mystical quest tropes. Language occasionally drifts toward ornate abstraction ("pathways of contradiction") but mostly maintains clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements are tightly integrated into a cohesive thematic framework. The metaphorical approach elevates the story above checklist-style usage, though some conceptual ideas lack concrete embodiment.</comment>
