<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Necromancer's powers are irrelevant to her mapping goal; motivation to dominate caves lacks psychological depth. Baseball cap is decorative, not formative. Dialogue reveals little about her inner life.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot meanders without tension. "Sound of resolve" repetition fails as narrative engine. Climax/nonlinear timeframe absent. Pacing drifts without cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystalline visuals impress but lack symbolic resonance. Futuristic nostalgia tone inconsistently maintained between tech (drone) and noir projections. Sensory details sporadically vivid rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Metaphors remain superficial. Ending circular rather than resonant. Theme of uncovering forgotten truths underdeveloped. Telling ("solace") outweighs showing in emotional beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overuse of echo/tunnel/light motifs suggests formulaic passages. Necromancer-drone-movies combination feels arbitrary, not innovative. Emotional depth conveyed through adjectival shortcuts rather than nuanced characterization.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Element checklist over narrative cohesion. Length emphasizes setting over development. Writing style fluctuates between poeticism and flat exposition. Lacks haunting afterimage.</comment>
