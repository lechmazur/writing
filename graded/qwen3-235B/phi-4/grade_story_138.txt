<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lord Alistair’s noble background doesn’t deeply inform his actions or voice; his introspection feels abstract rather than rooted in specific, humanized traits. Motivation lacks visceral urgency or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure exists but lacks momentum—pacing stalls in the middle. Resolution feels abrupt, relying on thematic statements rather than earned progression. The lab’s volatile setting only loosely mirrors internal turmoil.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lab’s crackling air and machinery hum create minimal atmosphere; sensory details are sparse and generic. Setting fails to deepen character or concept, feeling more symbolic than tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts poetic resonance but leans on clichéd metaphors (“spark of authenticity”). Ending lacks tension or subtext; emotional impact is muted by vague abstractions rather than visceral details.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases (“candor,” “illusions”) and mechanical logic suggest formulaic writing. Overreliance on adverbial descriptors (“peculiar method”) distracts; lacks risk-taking or subversive twists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are present but feel checklist-driven; thematic coherence is superficial. Story ends without lingering resonance, leaving its “moment” unanchored to broader human truths.</comment>
