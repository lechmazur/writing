<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains passive observer; emotional depth implied but never demonstrated through action. Motivation stated but not earned. Assigned attributes function as labels rather than integrated traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot follows checklist progression of assigned elements without organic development. Cause-effect relationships feel manufactured. Pacing lurches between static observations and arbitrary outcomes. Resolution lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Vague "interdimensional" descriptors replace concrete worldbuilding. Overreliance on abstract terms ("mysterious familiarity") creates atmospheric inertia. Sensory details are generic and disconnected from character experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Attempts at thematic depth ("home," "compromise") remain superficial. Emotive language functions as substitute for authentic emotional engagement. Minimal narrative tension. Literary devices feel decorative rather than essential to meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>Relentless string of clich√©d metaphors ("tapestry of hidden hours," "hammered shapes"). Repetitive sentence patterns suggest algorithmic generation. Character reasoning lacks psychological complexity. Predictable structure mimics template-driven writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elements function as disconnected checkboxes rather than narrative components. Short form exacerbates structural fragmentation. No stylistic innovation or conceptual surprise. Leaves no lingering emotional or intellectual residue.</comment>
