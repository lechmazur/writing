<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elara's pragmatic nature and motivation to become a force of nature are established but lack psychological depth; her "lavish humility" is superficially depicted without fully integrating into her internal conflicts or nuanced interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A clear drought/resolution arc exists within the constraints, but the sudden pivot to chanting and the raincloud's appearance feel underdeveloped; cause-and-effect coherence is maintained, but pacing lacks urgency or complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The gnarled forest village setting is minimally evoked through sparse descriptors; atmosphere relies on vague phrases like "twisted branches" rather than immersive sensory details or tonal distinctness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of power/responsibility are present but stated rather than explored; the ending's shift to "guardian" rhetoric lacks emotional weight; symbolic potential of the hammer and song is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy tropes (magical heirlooms, humble saviors) without subversion; repetitive phrases like "ethereal light" and "dreadful hope" verge on abstraction; character motivation feels logical but lacks human complexity or originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but mechanically assembled; the tight word limit exacerbates disjointedness between setting, action, and theme; fails to elevate beyond a plot summary with poetic adornments.</comment>
