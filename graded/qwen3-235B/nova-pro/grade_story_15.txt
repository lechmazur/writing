<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (defying gods through hope) is consistent, but her 'gracious' trait lacks depth beyond caretaking; actions align with motivation but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The postcard-driven plot progresses unevenly—slow immersion in forge-tending contrasts with abrupt, unexplained postcard origins; resolution feels implied rather than earned within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dense fog and ruined orchard evoke melancholy, but setting-plot integration is sparse; sensory details (e.g., "whispering walls") are evocative but inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (forge as love’s afterlife) carries emotional weight; "solemnly absurd" tone is underdeveloped; ending leans on poetic abstraction over narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on gothic tropes (widow’s grief, haunted forge); postcards feel contrived; avoids purple prose but lacks linguistic originality to fully transcend familiar themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (hope’s persistence) but strain logically; tone balances poetic and grounded, yet pacing and underexplored elements limit impact.</comment>
