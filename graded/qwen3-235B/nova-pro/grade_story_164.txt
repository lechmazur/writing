<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Main character lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through consequential actions. Interactions feel symbolic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Introduces setting and premise but remains structurally static. Narrative arc truncated by word limit, with underdeveloped cause-effect chain between key moments like the arrival of the customer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts between cyberpunk environment and organic elements create immersive, thematically charged atmosphere. Sensory details (forge heat, neon glow) effectively anchor world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors about fire/creation have conceptual resonance but surface-level execution. Ending states thematic intention rather than demonstrating emotional or narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in blending fantasy and sci-fi traditions, but relies on established anti-technocracy tropes. Overly elaborate descriptions occasionally verge on purple prose without breaking new ground.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive if unremarkable. Elements combine without transcendent synergy; experimental structure feels constrained rather than purposeful within brevity.</comment>
