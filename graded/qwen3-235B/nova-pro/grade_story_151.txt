<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation to topple fear-based idol is conceptually stated but inconsistently manifested through actions; introspective musings on snowflakes and emotions lack psychological nuance, creating distance between stated attributes and demonstrated behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a meditative arc but lacks dramatic tension; the action of studying snowflakes remains static rather than actively driving progression, with loosely connected thematic revelations rather than cause-and-effect developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through crystalline imagery and ice metaphors that deepen thematic concerns, though sparse sensory engagement (e.g., lack of tactile coldness or auditory stillness) slightly weakens immersive impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of snowflake symbolism to explore human complexity and the veil as a relic of emotional fragility offer layered meaning; ending resolves character arc satisfyingly but lacks visceral emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional overreliance on abstract poeticism ("rationally organic," "fluid nature of moral dilemmas") borders on pretentiousness; metaphors function cohesively but rarely surprise, balancing lyrical strength against occasionally formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story prioritizes thematic cohesion over narrative urgency; elements are serviceable rather than symbiotic, with brevity enhancing poetic density but sacrificing emotional investment in character transformation.</comment>
