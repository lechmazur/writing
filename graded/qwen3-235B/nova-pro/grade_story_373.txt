<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Inconsistently developed; motivations lack concrete grounding despite thematic repetition. Internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied through specific actions or reactions to the assigned object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Lacks coherent structure; repetitive phrasing creates circularity rather than progression. Arbitrary segmentation into numbered "paragraphs" undermines narrative momentum and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vague sensory details and tonal contradictions (e.g., "raucous silence") undermine atmosphere. Coral setting feels ornamental rather than integral to character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Predictable metaphors and empty lyricism fail to create emotional engagement. Over-reliance on thematic buzzwords ("defiance," "turmoil") replaces substantive subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Formulaic phrases ("kaleidoscopic coral," "internal turmoil") and strained abstractions suggest uncritical AI patterning. Missing idiosyncratic voice or thematic originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Element checklist approach outweighs narrative cohesion. Stilted integration of assignments creates mechanical, episodic feel rather than unified story.</comment>
