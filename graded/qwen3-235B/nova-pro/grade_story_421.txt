<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations stated not shown. Masked intentions and politeness are superficial traits without psychological complexity or evolution during the action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Linear progression without narrative tension or escalation. Coin toss framing and wheel-turning resolution feel arbitrary within tight word limits, lacking satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Workshop atmosphere uses basic floral descriptors but fails to integrate setting into plot mechanics. Sensory details remain decorative rather than thematically functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (blooming flowers, light burst) relies on clich√©s. Emotional resonance undermined by excessive exposition; subtext and conflict resolution remain shallow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Formulaic hero's journey structure with predictable beats. Overused "chosen one" trope and generic mystical object execution indicate algorithmic pattern replication.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely connected. Lacks narrative ingenuity to interweave components into a cohesive, compelling whole despite high-concept potential.</comment>
