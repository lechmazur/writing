<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Themes of beauty/collapse are present but shallowly treated; relies on poetic abstraction rather than evocative subtext or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Mantra-like repetition of phrases ("shyly unstoppable") feels formulaic; metaphors like "whispers of ancient secrets" border on clich√©; tone shifts lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements jammed into a vague arc about finding beauty; structure prioritizes word count over organic cohesion; ending lacks visceral impact.</comment>
