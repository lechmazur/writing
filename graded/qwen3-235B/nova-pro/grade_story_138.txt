<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation (cutting illusions) is clear but underdeveloped; character’s nobility lacks contextual significance; internal conflict remains abstract despite repetitive references to "hollow recklessness."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Surface-level arc (drone assembly = identity recovery) lacks narrative momentum; repetitive phrases (e.g., "candor in small moments") substitute for progression; cause-effect logic is present but perfunctory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting reduces "spontaneous combustion lab" to a buzzword without sensory specificity; chaotic science/magic atmosphere inconsistently tied to character actions or thematic goals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of drone as identity-reclamation is conceptually strong but undermined by overuse of clichéd metaphors ("echo of heartbeat") and excessive telling vs. showing; ending feels redundant rather than resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Rampant repetition of phrases ("hollow recklessness," "candor in small moments"), formulaic descriptors ("electric tension," "lullaby of forgotten dreams"), and abrupt tonal shifts suggest algorithmic default patterns; lacks subversive freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially interwoven; drone and motivation work best, but most elements (lab, ticket stubs, text messages) feel arbitrarily appended rather than organically connected; themes lack depth.</comment>
