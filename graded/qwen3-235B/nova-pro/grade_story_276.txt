<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Characters remain archetypal with minimal emotional depth; "uneasy emissary" is a vessel for ideas rather than a psychologically complex figure. Motivation stated rather than demonstrated through sustained behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates surface-level arc but lacks meaningful progression. Pattern discovery feels arbitrarily sudden rather than organically earned through narrative development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting established through sensory fragments (machinery hum, dangling hanger) creates atmospheric tension, but orbital environment remains superficially explored despite its rich potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasional effective metaphors (postcards as "branches of redemption") and symbolic resonance, but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction and underdeveloped themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Pattern-filled descriptions (postcards "whispering" home) veer toward clich√©. Character behavior follows logical trajectory but lacks human irrationality or nuance. Repetitive phrasing ("consistently surprising") diminishes impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story incorporates elements without fully integrating them. Attempts at thematic unity (patterns/redemption) remain intellectual rather than emotionally engaging. Style occasionally obfuscates substance.</comment>
