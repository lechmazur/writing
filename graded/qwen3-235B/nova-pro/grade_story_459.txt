<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leo's ghost-seeing ability shapes his isolation but isn't deeply manifested in unique behaviors. His elegantly clumsy trait remains underutilized theatrically. Connection between his motivation and actions is clear but psychologically simplistic, relying on symbolic rather than experiential revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Discovery of the crown initiates character-driven plot, but the arc feels compressed. Logical cause-effect connections exist in Leo's internal journey rather than external action. Pacing alternates between stagnant reflection and accelerated epiphany. The conclusion resolves thematically but lacks narrative momentum, fitting the word limit imperfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sand castle lab provides visual poetry but remains conceptually dominant over sensory specifics. Atmosphere relies on clichéd silence-as-metaphor rather than tangible details. The ephemeral sculptures mirror the theme but lack olfactory/tactile description, weakening the immersive potential of such a tactile setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uses sand preservation as effective symbolism for emotional repression. The "melody of silence" ending satisfies thematically but leans on abstract exposition rather than earned emotional resonance. Subtext about holding vs. releasing is present but inconsistently demonstrated through specific character choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Excessive abstract phrasing ("complex simplicity," "dissonance of silence") borders on cliché. The lab's novelty feels like quirkiness for its own sake. Repeated refrains about silence and liberation create mechanical predictability. Character reasoning prioritizes thematic boxes over human inconsistency, suggesting formulaic structuring rather than organic growth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenly – the crown and dissection method work best while "elegantly clumsy" and ghost tours feel forced. Length exposes structural weaknesses through repetitive phrasing. Leaves thematic impression but lacks technical polish or stylistic distinctness to elevate beyond competent competence.</comment>
