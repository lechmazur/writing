<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation shifts; redemption arc feels rushed without emotional grounding. The archer's "disappointment" and "passionate disinterest" lack psychological depth or specific behavioral manifestations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on arbitrary magical elements (inverted waterfall, roadside bridge) that defy internal logic. Narrative progression relies on abstract symbolism rather than cause-effect relationships. Pacing uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on recycled imagery (celestial bodies, waterfalls) without sensory specificity or emotional integration. The inverted waterfall feels like a superficial "weird" element rather than a meaningful environmental force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbols (comb, bridge) carry thematic weight but are over-explained. The ending feels artificially tidy despite surface-level exploration of "regret vs. renewal." Subtext is surface-level rather than earned through concrete storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d metaphors (gravity-defying hope, bridges of regret). Over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("mesmerizing," "fragile structure of hope"). Emotional beats stated rather than dramatized. Generic transitions between elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mechanical insertion of assigned elements disrupts cohesion (sudden shift to "chronicle social movements"). Magical realism lacks rules or emotional logic. The brief length highlights rather than serves the narrative's thematic ambitions.</comment>
