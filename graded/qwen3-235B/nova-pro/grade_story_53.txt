<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (cosmic solace) is clear but "rash" trait remains undefined; lacks distinct voice or depth in reactions to postcards despite repetition of themes</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows linearly from moving to postcard discovery to realization, but feels rushed; key moments lack emotional buildup within tight word limit</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Generic descriptors (whispers, howling winds) create atmospheric potential without sensory specificity; fortress setting remains superficially connected to plot</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts poetic metaphor but relies heavily on telling ("realized they were not alone") vs showing; theme of belonging lacks emotional resonance through vague abstraction</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Overtly formulaic: "whispers of the past," "tapestry of existence" feel algorithmically generated; repetitive adjectives ad nauseam; predictable structure with no subversion of cosmic exploration tropes</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements partially cohesive but mechanical; postcards serve plot function without deeper integration; mystical tone unevenly applied; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful</comment>
