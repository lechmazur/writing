<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped. Motivation (salvaging a dream) lacks visceral connection to his actions. Absent-mindedness feels more like passive drifting than active characterization. Ironic hopefulness is stated but not deeply dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks clear narrative propulsion. The chance encounter serves as a deus ex machina rather than organic plot development. Pacing feels uneven - rushes through emotional beats while lingering on atmospheric details. No discernible arc within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Contrast between sound archive's serenity and train station's chaos is effective. Sensory details (fluorescent gleam of brass, ambient announcements) create vivid atmosphere. AI timeframe mentioned but underexploited as a worldbuilding element. Intimate detachment tone inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolic resonance (lion knocker as strength in chaos) elevate the story. Subtle showing through sensory engagement rather than exposition. Ending achieves thematic circularity. Lacks narrative urgency but creates lingering emotional impression through poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mix of inspired choices (brewer combining sound and taste) and formulaic elements (serene woman archetype). Avoids outright clich√©s but contains predictable emotional gradients. Some phrases border on purple prose ("storm of his doubts"). Metaphors mostly effective but not consistently groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper integration. The brief form feels like both a strength (focus on moment) and limitation (underdeveloped implications). Creative combinations exist (brewer using sound archives) but could be more fully realized. Leaves thematic questions rather than deep resonance.</comment>
