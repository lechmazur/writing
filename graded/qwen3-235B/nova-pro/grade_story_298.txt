<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's 'chameleon' trait and 'rational impulsiveness' remain abstract, insufficiently shaping actions or interactions. Motivation lacks emotional depth despite linking to the dress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through environmental exploration, but the word limit restricts closure. Pacing is steady, though the ending feels premature.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid visual details create atmosphere, but the 'oil extraction' element is underexploited. Sensory immersion is uneven; tone of 'anxious serenity' is minimally operationalized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (dress, painting) and subtext about historical memory elevate impact, but emotional resonance remains surface-level due to underdeveloped stakes and character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Premise is intriguing but relies on clich√©d tropes (mysterious painting, lost princess). Language occasionally veers into ornate generality ('whispering secrets'), and motivations feel author-imposed rather than emergent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High concept potential undermined by uneven element integration. The brevity accentuates fragmentation, and thematic depth doesn't fully compensate for narrative thinness.</comment>
