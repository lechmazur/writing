<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's skittish nature is mentioned but not demonstrated through actions; motivation to access subconscious power feels abstract rather than earned, with inconsistent demonstration of how ballet shoes or loom symbolism directly shapes behavior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pseudo-arcs through "ritual" and "discovery" stages, but lacks concrete conflict/resolution; pacing oscillates between glacial and abrupt, with ritual climax feeling unearned despite attempts at metaphorical cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Failed synthesis of "lunar colony" tech with "barbershop hush" creates tonal whiplash; overused generic descriptors like "sterile yet comforting" instead of visceral, otherworldly lunar-specific sensory details; atmospheric elements don't meaningfully interact with character's journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors ("subconscious labyrinth," "weaving psyche") substitute for genuine emotional resonance; no meaningful subtext beneath surface-level symbol parade; writing-by-numbers aesthetic without earned transcendence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>AI-generated fingerprints everywhere: repetitive loom/grace/ballet terminology, faux-profound vagueness, clich√©d "power within" resolution; no linguistic idiosyncrasy or risk-taking; would fit any new-age self-help parable with setting labels randomly swapped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Element checklist compliance without narrative necessity; excessive thematic redundancy creates artificial density; brevity feels like arbitrary truncation rather than disciplined distillation; leaves no lingering impact beyond initial prettiness.</comment>
