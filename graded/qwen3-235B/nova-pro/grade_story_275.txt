<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character defined by stated traits rather than organic actions; motivation clarified but underdeveloped, actions follow logic but lack emotional depth; lacks distinct individuality beyond archetypal "hermit" role</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but lacks dynamic tension; weathervane method introduced but under-explained; beginning/end connection clear but pivotal transformation feels compressed; pacing leans repetitious</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere has striking visual motifs (comet/orchard) but sparse sensory texture; tone oscillates between mystical and clinical; setting supports thematic concerns but lacks tactile immediacy</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Offers symbolic resonance (album as hope) and thematic cohesion (resilience); relies on telling over showing for emotional stakes; ending earns its uplift through cumulative imagery, but lacks narrative complexity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains formulaic phrasing ("fragile glory," "mindful choices"); metaphors consistent but not revelatory; atmospheric precision sometimes devolves into aestheticized abstraction</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combined with functional coherence but not transformative synergy; brevity used effectively for poetic rhythm but at expense of narrative texture; stylistic consistency maintained but lacks risk-taking</comment>
