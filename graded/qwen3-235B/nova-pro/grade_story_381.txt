<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The necromancer character lacks defining traits of necromancy or "hushed" qualities. Motivation to map is clear but disconnected from other assigned elements. The baseball cap is symbolic but doesn't reveal meaningful character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Basic exploration plot exists but lacks narrative tension. Mapping action doesn't drive meaningful progression. Beginning and end connect weakly with no substantial transformation. Pacing is static without clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Some vivid descriptions of crystals but world-building is superficial. "Futuristic nostalgia" is named rather than demonstrated through specific contrasts. Sensory details are inconsistently evocative across assigned concepts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Generic poetic flourishes without meaningful literary devices. No deeper themes beyond surface narrative. The ending has no emotional or intellectual impact. Lacks purposeful perspective or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi/fantasy elements without innovation. "Hushed necromancer" concept remains unexplored. Some attempt at combining old/new aesthetics but relies on familiar tropes. Language occasionally becomes overly ornate without purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements are present but feel imposed rather than organically integrated. Short form doesn't enhance storytelling. Combines assigned aspects mechanically without demonstrating creative purpose or leaving lasting impression.</comment>
