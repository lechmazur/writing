<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Shallow exploration of "frenetic" traits; motivations (threading labyrinth) stated but underdramatized; lunchbox's significance to personality remains unconvincing</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically assembled; short form exposes conceptual gaps; thematic coherence falters under scrutiny</comment>
