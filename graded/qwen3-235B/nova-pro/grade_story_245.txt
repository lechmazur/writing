<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract poetic device rather than fully realized entity; motivations are implied through metaphors but lack visceral investment or concrete backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No discernible plot progression within word limit; cyclical rumination replaces narrative momentum; connection between beginning and end feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of desolation effectively conveyed through sensory details (steam, cold), but abandoned spaceport remains superficially sketched setting that doesn't actively shape events.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphor, imagery) demonstrate ambition, but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction; ending lacks satisfying resonance despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on flowery, disconnected metaphors suggests formulaic poeticizing; inconsistent tone shifts between sci-fi and Eastern mysticism feel inorganic rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion compromised by prioritization of metaphor over narrative logic; brevity feels limiting rather than intentional; elements introduced without sufficient synthesis.</comment>
