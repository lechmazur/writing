<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or psychological depth; "innocent cynicism" stated but never dramatized. Motivation feels generic rather than being uniquely tied to seer's persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Procedural progression lacks narrative stakes or emotional arc. Relies on clich√©d "hacking montage" pacing. Resolution feels abrupt due to underdeveloped tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vague sensory details (rain scent, flickering screen) create atmosphere but fail to integrate with plot or theme. Setting becomes mere backdrop rather than active story element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attempts symbolic resonance through relic/revelation structure but executes predictably. Lacks subtext exploration of "delayed justice" concept. Ending too clean for claimed sophistication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Relies heavily on "lone genius decrypting mystery" trope without subversion. Purple prose ("analytically innovative...innocent cynicism") signals formulaic embellishment over genuine voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. Climactic reveal lacks thematic weight. Surface-level engagement with assigned prompts suggests structural rigidity.</comment>
