<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful actions; traits like "even-tempered" and "systematically rebellious" don't fully manifest in behavior or decision-making that shapes the narrative</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Predictable arc follows assigned action without meaningful complications; tight word limit exacerbates flat progression, offering no significant transformation or tension despite beginning/middle/end structure</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overloaded with assigned elements that coexist rather than synergize; stylistic excess compensates for shallow thematic exploration; length limitations expose lack of narrative architecture</comment>
