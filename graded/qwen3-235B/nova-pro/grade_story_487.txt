<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Thorne's docility and size are established but underexplored; his motivation to "mold a myth" feels abstract rather than deeply personal, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable "quest" arc but struggles with cohesion—the treasure map method is underdeveloped, and the ending feels abrupt despite attempts at thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are inconsistent; the greenhouse labyrinth’s man-eating plants and drum solos clash tonally, undermining atmospheric unity and immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on overused tropes (e.g., magical relics, labyrinth monsters) without subversion; verbose, uneven prose undermines authenticity and originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements feel modular rather than integral; the story’s brevity exposes forced integration of concepts rather than celebrating their interplay.</comment>
