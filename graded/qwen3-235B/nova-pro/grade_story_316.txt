<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's timidity is inconsistently portrayed; inner conflict lacks depth despite clear childhood vow motivator. "Seraphic" aspect remains superficial, undercut by sudden, unearned transformation to courage without psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Arc structure exists but lacks causal momentum—the scoreboard consultation as pivotal action feels arbitrary. Pacing uneven, with rushed resolution to lifelong timidity and vague era-ending transition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Visually rich but tonally disjointed amalgam of ancient/modern. Sensory details (glowing marble, flowers) create atmosphere but disconnect between temple solemnity and arcade relic undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphoric weaving has potential but relies heavily on overt symbolism. Emotional payoff diluted by abstract "scattered harmony" ending; theme of healing remains conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept hybridization is bold but execution uneven. Stylistic flourishes (whispering ghosts, breathing tapestry) border on cliché; emotional beats told more than shown through nuanced conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overambitious element integration creates fracture points—temple-worldbuilding, arcade-scoreboard logic, and metaphysical healing resist synthesis. Lingering question of "what drives what?" weakens thematic resonance.</comment>
