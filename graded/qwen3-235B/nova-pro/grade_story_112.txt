<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations shift abruptly without psychological nuance. "Aimlessness" contrasts with sudden obsessive focus on preservation without believable evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under arbitrary connections (hopscotch → recipes) and rushed arc. Cause/effect relationships feel algorithmically contrived rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid moments ("snowflake melted") but oppressive formality in descriptions undermines immersion. Archives feel more like a stock Gothic setting than purposeful environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Occasional striking metaphors ("seeds of vigilance") but undercut by heavy-handedness. Ending lacks resolution or revelatory power, leaving theme of preservation feeling performative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Riddled with clichéd phrases ("whisper of the past") and inconsistent tone shifts. Mechanical use of "factually imaginative" feels tacked on rather than integral to narrative innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than symbiosis. Premise shows glimmers of creativity but ultimately reads as concept checklist rather than unified artistic vision.</comment>
