<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation to learn "language of dreams" remains abstract and drives little concrete action. No distinct voice or psychological nuances to humanize the performer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot substitutes mood for momentum. Progression feels static, but poetic cohesion and faint arc (learning journey) marginally satisfy constraints. Pacing uneven but not incoherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting devolves into cliche-fantasy aesthetics—giant ferns, waterfalls—with no specific geography or cultural texture. Atmosphere is vague and generic, failing to immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Poetic language often overwhelms clarity, but sparse imagery (moon paths, ring as rumor-guardian) lingers. Lacks emotional engagement or thematic resonance; tells more than shows.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive metaphors ("precise madness," "blank-faced") and overwrought abstraction veer into purple prose. Conceptual ambition is undercut by formulaic language and lack of subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements fit superficially but lack synergy. Themes of obsession and secrecy feel forced. Brief length highlights fragmentation rather than precision; no lingering resonance.</comment>
