<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mariner's "coldly intense" trait lacks concrete manifestations; stated determination doesn't translate into distinct actions. The connection between his motivation ("to set reason ablaze with wonder") and specific choices remains vague, relying on poetic abstraction rather than embodied behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trail from searching forest to ladder ascent to theater arrival, but the symbolic logic remains diffuse. The ladder's "uneven rungs = choices" device drives movement rather than meaningful action. Resolution at theater feels perfunctory within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ultraviolet light creates striking visuals but remains atmospheric window-dressing rather than environmental force. The electric charge hum and glowing trees evoke mood without shaping character behavior or narrative stakes in tangible ways.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "reason ablaze with wonder" glimmer without igniting. Descent after ladder lacks emotional weight, and theater's symbolic potential isn't fully leveraged. Ending neither resolves nor provocatively reframes central questions about freedom's cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest offers novelty but lapses into familiar mystical trope patterns. The "map to elusive price" formulation veers toward clich√©. Character psychology remains an enigmatic silhouette rather than a nuanced portrait, leaning on poetic vagueness to mask depth deficits.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story maintains formal coherence despite element-dense mandate but sacrifices thematic precision and emotional resonance. The theater framing device suggests potential for performance/metaphor synthesis that remains underdeveloped, leaving more questions than provocative uncertainties.</comment>
