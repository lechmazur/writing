<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's "hyperactive serenity" is stated but inconsistently demonstrated; her motivation to bury hatred is clear but lacks psychological depth; the sticker sheet reveals her internal conflict but fails to fully anchor her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end within constraints, but pacing feels uneven; cause/effect between sticker discovery and resolution is logical yet rushed; steampunk elements don't significantly shape the plot's direction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dense sensory details (gears, parchment) effectively immerse, but steampunk setting remains decorative rather than integral; atmosphere supports theme but lacks connection to core action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like mixtapes as portals show promise, but emotional payoff is generic; theme of embracing the past is clear but undercut by abrupt transitions; relies on stating rather than showing change.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Verdant sensory descriptions border on purple prose; "savage grace" and "hollow victory" feel like applied labels rather than organic developments; emotional progression lacks human nuance beneath surface-level redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused; steampunk dining hall and mixtapes feel conceptually disjointed; thematic takeaway exists but lacks lingering depth; style alternates between evocative and overwritten.</comment>
