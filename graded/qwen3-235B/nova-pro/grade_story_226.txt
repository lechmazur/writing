<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Poorly developed character. Motivation (collecting lullabies) stated repeatedly but never demonstrated through meaningful action. Craftsman's pride used as abstract concept rather than behavior. Skull interaction lacks substance. No distinguishable voice or emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot exists only as a sequence of disconnected declarations. No causal chain - actions (black-market transactions, resonance testing) appear without narrative progression. Artificial segmentation creates illusion of structure. Fails to cohere despite constrained word count. Ending feels arbitrary, not earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Vague sensory details ("sun-bleached", "hush") never create immersive environment. Skull lacks physical or symbolic connection to setting. Resonance facility mentioned but never described. Atmosphere fails to support theme of preservation vs entropy. Desert setting remains inert backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Relies on empty poeticism rather than substantive literary technique. Repetition of phrases like "haggard awe" undermines impact. Lacks subtext - themes stated overtly rather than embodied. Central conflict (man vs time) remains abstract. Ending provides no emotional or thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Formulaic "desert dystopia" tropes with artificial nostalgia theme. Overuse of abstract adjectives ("genuine passion", "haggard awe"). Nuance sacrificed for poetic abstraction. Character motivations expressed through generic existential longing rather than specific human psychology. Metaphors remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story feels like checklist of elements rather than organic narrative. Arbitrary paragraph structure suggests artificial word count compliance. No evidence of deliberate brevity enhancing meaning. Failed synthesis of assigned components results in disjointed whole with no lasting impact.</comment>
