<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character has surface-level traits (cyber/ancient duality, motivation) but lacks psychological depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through actions; emotional reactions remain abstract</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc (prayer ➔ ritual ➔ aftermath) but constrained by vignette-like structure; cause-effect between lightning deflection and chaos resistance is logical but underdeveloped; pacing uneven during technical descriptions</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere builds through color/light play (sun/prism/storm) but lacks tactile/smell details; setting feels underutilized as symbolic battlefield; euphoric agitation tone inconsistent</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Offers prism as central metaphor and order-vs-chaos theme but lacks emotional resonance; relies too heavily on declarative statements rather than subtextual exploration; ending feels abrupt rather than resonant</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptual mashup (cyber-templar/prism ritual) shows ingenuity but execution veers toward "mythic hero" clichés; repetitive storm/lightning imagery borders on formulaic; overly reliant on adjective-heavy visual descriptions</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements present but often decorative rather than integral; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; combines sacred and technological well but lacks philosophical insight beyond surface-level contrasts</comment>
