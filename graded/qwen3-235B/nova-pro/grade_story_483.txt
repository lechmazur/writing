<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's world-weariness is evident but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but lack psychological complexity. Symbolic use of Ace of Hearts insufficiently probes inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear structure exists but feels compressed; meditation session acts as convenient pivot point without earned emotional weight. Plot resolution aligns thematically but lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Contrasts between chaos and tranquility established through visual details, but sensory engagement remains superficial. Lava lamps provide memorable atmosphere but lack symbolic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Relies on conventional symbolism (cards, road journeys) to convey theme. Emotional impact diluted by "tell" statements ("felt renewed purpose") rather than visceral demonstration of transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overuses clich√©d juxtapositions (chaos/tranquility) and predictable character arcs. Purple prose ("steadily chaotic life") and schematic plot turns suggest formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Competent execution of genre expectations without distinctive insight. Combines assigned elements cosmetically rather than organically; fails to transform tropes into compelling literary territory.</comment>
