<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations and inconsistent portrayal; the bodyguard's actions feel plot-driven rather than organically emerging from his traits, while "serendipitously stubborn" lacks substantive demonstration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc exists but feels truncated; key plot developments (overheard stories, rebellion plan) are under-explained, creating gaps in logic that strain coherence within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting relies on vague descriptors ("serene yet hostile") without immersive sensory details; fails to leverage lunar greenhouse's unique potential to heighten narrative tension or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Surface-level themes of freedom lack emotional depth; dialogue is declarative rather than nuanced, and the abrupt ending undercuts potential for lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relys on rebellion clich√©s and overly abstract phrases ("timely rebirth"); simplistic character reasoning and generic metaphoric language suggest formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely integrated; story feels constrained by checklist rather than organically cohesive, with underexploited thematic and atmospheric potential.</comment>
