<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Insufficient integration of "naturally peculiar" into concrete behavior; motivation shifts feel abrupt without emotional groundwork; symbolic actions (spice rack interaction) inadequately reveal inner logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rushed transformation arc lacks causal progression; pivotal "language exchange" event functions as arbitrary deus ex machina; episodic structure fails to cohere within word constraints; underdeveloped tension between mourning and mapping.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Interdimensional setting remains abstract backdrop rather than active force; atmospheric motifs ("dignified chaos") inconsistently applied; spice rack's sensory details contrast poorly developed spatial logic; tone oscillates without anchor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical language (canvas, dance) demonstrates craftsmanship but lacks narrative consequence; self-discovery theme remains abstract rather than dramatized; emotional resonance undercut by excessive exposition over experiential storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic abstraction risks clich√© ("whispers of reprieve"); inconsistent sensory specificity; some phrases ("dignified chaos") border on forced originality; psychological interiority remains underexplored despite first-person potential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element integration feels algorithmically dutiful rather than organically necessary; thematic momentum dissipates under abstraction; brevity works against depth but not against coherence; final revelation lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>
