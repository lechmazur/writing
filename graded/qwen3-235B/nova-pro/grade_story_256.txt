<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Conflicting traits (kindly yet loyally disloyal) remain underexplored; motivations tied to the horizon and spoon are abstract but lack psychological depth or concrete backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative logic; abrupt shift from grocery store introspection to horizon leap disrupts causal flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overly reliant on clich√© metaphors ("frothy despair," "whispers of clouds") without immersive sensory details; floating cafe feels like thin wallpaper for abstract themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stilted attempts at lyrical abstraction (e.g., "keystroke...prayer") undermine emotional resonance; the ending's symbolic leap lacks tension or earned transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("edges of time," "rhythm of typewriter keys") overwhelms narrative coherence; tropes recycled without subversion (lonely guardian, mystical horizon).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements function as disconnected symbols rather than organic narrative components; tonal inconsistency between whimsical setting and "despair" undermines thematic unity.</comment>
