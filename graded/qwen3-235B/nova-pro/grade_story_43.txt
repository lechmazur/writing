<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior; "loudly introverted" feels tacked on rather than shaping character actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks dramatic tension and cause-effect progression; self-realization arrives without meaningful obstacles or earned resolution within the compressed structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere created through synesthetic light descriptions persists, but sensory details lack specificity beyond "thick fog" and colorful vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("cacophony of silence") undercut by clich√©d epiphany and abstract telling rather than embodied emotional truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Borders on purple prose with overwritten phrases; combines mystical elements formulaically without meaningful subversion of post-apocalyptic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist without organic synthesis; brevity lacks narrative ambition beyond pretentious symbolism, failing to transcend its component parts.</comment>
