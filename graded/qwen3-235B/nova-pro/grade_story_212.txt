<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped actions like jabbering to cards lack psychological nuance; resolve feels generic rather than rooted in specific history or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on repetitive thematic phrases rather than structural progression; abrupt shifts between seed-planting, cards, and bottles create disjointed segments without causal momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Ethereal plains" described through vague, recycled descriptors; sensory details are shallow; the post-apocalyptic setting lacks tangible elements like radiation scars or mutated flora that could ground the atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on explicit thematizing ("song of boundaries") rather than subtext; effective metaphors (seeds as defiance) undermined by over-articulated messages that flatten emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Typically atypical" farmer follows genre tropes without subversion; magician's deck and bottles feel like checklist elements; "raw solace" phrasing appears formulaic rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic window dressing rather than narrative drivers; the constrained form highlights redundancy (e.g., multiple "hope" symbols) rather than creating cumulative impact; lacks piercing originality.</comment>
