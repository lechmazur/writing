<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits conflict (bluntness vs. caution) and motivation feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically integrated. The teddy bear adds minimal depth to character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable puzzle-solving structure, with adequate cause-effect logic but simplistic resolution. Pacing manages word limit but lacks narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vivid but generic sensory details create atmosphere without distinct integration of elements like the stock ticker, which jars with the temple setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Moderate emotional engagement through curiosity, but lacks layered subtext or memorable thematic depth. Relies on stated emotions rather than subtle showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Formulaic phrases ("whirlwind of possibilities," "mental duel") and inconsistent tone (formal vs. cryptic) suggest artificial construction. The teddy bear is a rare original touch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Element integration feels haphazard (e.g., stock ticker in temple). Premise lacks emotional resonance or conceptual innovation within the constrained format.</comment>
