<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks meaningful progression, relying on vague incantations and abrupt transformations; beginning-end connection feels arbitrary; cause-effect logic obscured by mystical vagueness; pacing uneven due to excessive description over action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid surface imagery but generic descriptors like "hues of despair" lack specificity; setting's paradoxical thriving doesn't influence plot; radioactive dust storms remain decorative rather than shaping the narrative's stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dystopian tropes (radiation, lone savior) and overused techniques (flowery similes, "merry bitterness") feel formulaic; sudden conceptual shifts (feminizing costume via glitter) lack organic connection; language often prioritizes ornamentation over clarity or innovation.</comment>
