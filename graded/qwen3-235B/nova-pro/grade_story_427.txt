<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. Mechanical arm serves as arbitrary symbol, not organic trait shaping decisions. Lacks distinct voice or depth beneath philosophical concepts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Arc exists but feels artificially compressed. Revelation via sock lacks earned emotional payoff. Pacing drags in conceptual explanations, while cause-effect logic (sock triggering enlightenment) strains plausibility despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere evoked through sparse sensory details (“cold stone,” whispered secrets) but lacks visceral immersion. Lighthouse setting’s abandonment only superficially tied to desperation. Tone remains diffuse, never fully menacing or transcendent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses potent metaphors (sock as existential symbol) but over-relies on abstract exposition. Themes of balance resonate conceptually but lack tangible human stakes. Ending feels narratively closed yet emotionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but risks purple prose (“coded desperation,” “tangibly abstract”). Philosophical musings feel derivative; sock’s symbolism clever yet telegraphed. Overall voice leans toward pretentiousness over authentic originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements but fails to transcend their checklist inclusion. Conceptual ambition outweighs emotional execution. Lingering impression lies in ideas, not narrative depth or character resonance.</comment>
