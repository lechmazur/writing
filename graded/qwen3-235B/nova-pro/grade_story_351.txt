<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Flat, one-dimensional characterization; motivations are stated rather than psychologically grounded, with no internal conflict or growth to substantiate "formally rebellious" posture as anything more than a surface label.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Fragmentary progression between poetic vignettes lacks narrative propulsion; episodic structure obscures a meaningful arc, relying on repetitive imagery rather than causality or transformative culmination within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich but sensorially monochromatic; ivy and shadow imagery create nostalgia but lack olfactory, tactile, or auditory layers that might deepen the immersive decay of the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Aesthetic lyricism and symbolic motifs (sundial, unopened letter) evoke melancholic themes about memory’s fragility, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than viscerally destabilizing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clichéd tropes ("whispered secrets," "symphony of the past") and repetitive flourishes ("cryptic shapes," "delicate undoing") suggest formulaic romanticization without subversive nuance or psychological authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements are checked off rather than organically synthesized; the structural brevity feels constraining, with themes of forgotten legacies insufficiently interrogated beyond decorative melancholia.</comment>
