<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmented sentences create circular progression rather than a coherent plot arc. Repetition of phrases like "final leap of faith" undermines structural cohesion and momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Vague setting descriptors fail to create immersive atmosphere. The exo-atmospheric garden lacks sensory detail, rendering the tone abstract rather than evocative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d phrases ("resurrect forgotten dreams") and repetitive sentence structures. Frequent reiteration of "fiercely gentle" and "hushed confessions" feels algorithmic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elements appear checklist-driven rather than integrated. The fragmented format hinders thematic resonance, leaving fragments of ideas without meaningful synthesis.</comment>
