<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's traits are superficially stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions; her motivation to "restore a lost art" lacks emotional or contextual anchoring, and rebelliousness feels unearned. The obituary trade is underutilized as a narrative device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a linear quest arc but struggles with pacing—key transitions (e.g., organ resonance sparking revolution) feel abrupt. The revolution’s stakes remain unexplored within the word limit, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague, generic descriptors ("palpable tension," "labyrinthine streets") without immersive sensory detail. The revolution’s rumor and library setting lack cultural specificity, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (mask as choice, organ as agency) to explore art’s role in rebellion. The theme of creation as defiance is clear, but emotional depth is undercut by overly expository phrasing ("she found her purpose").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés with the mask’s morphing expressions and organ’s metaphorical resonance. Some purple prose ("humming resonance filling the air") and abrupt logical jumps suggest formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don’t interweave cohesively—e.g., the revolution backdrop’s relationship to theater restoration is unclear. The ending lacks thematic payoff, feeling like a declaration rather than earned resolution.</comment>
