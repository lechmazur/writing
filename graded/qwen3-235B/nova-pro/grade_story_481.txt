<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Inconsistent character depth; motivations stated more than dramatized, though the map-making skill meaningfully connects to her role. Abstract themes overshadow nuanced personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc present but structurally uneven; forced transitions between word-counted segments disrupt pacing. Clear beginning/middle/end compromised by artificial segmentation of narrative flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrasts (sterile warmth/cold) but illogical fusion of futuristic hospital and blacksmith forge undermines internal consistency. Atmosphere often prioritized over believable worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (dragonfly/forge) and thematic cohesion around innocence/resilience. Emotional resonance diluted by overwritten exposition; subtext occasionally overwhelmed by heavy-handed "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strains against formulaic transitions and overused metaphors (blacksmith=soul forging). Edgy nostalgia tone feels imposed rather than organically achieved through character perspective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution reveals scaffolding of assigned elements. Leaves lingering questions about theme, but narrative cohesion remains compromised by structural artifice.</comment>
