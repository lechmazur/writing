<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s regret drives her actions but lacks specific, visceral backstory. Her creativity is stated, not demonstrated through concrete decisions. Reactions to elements like the library feel functional, not revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from burden to evolution, but pacing falters. Frost inspiration feels abrupt; cause/effect between pressed leaves and car-window patterns is underdeveloped. Cohesion hinges on formulaic "redemption through art" tropes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Library and waterfall imagery are vivid but generic. Atmosphere leans on "ephemeral beauty" buzzwords without immersive sensory depth. Connection between frost designs and setting remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Themes of redemption and impermanence surface, but emotional resonance is undercut by abstraction. Overused phrases ("tapestry of redemption") dilute impact. Ending is picturesque but hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (hidden library, haunted artist) dominate. Frost method feels like a checklist item. Purple prose ("subtle paths unfolding") and repetitive motifs suggest algorithmic defaults rather than intentional craft.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements patched together mechanically. Breach between pressed leaves and frost patterns exposes construct-driven plotting. Lyrical closure lacks substance; lingers as shallow visual metaphor.</comment>
