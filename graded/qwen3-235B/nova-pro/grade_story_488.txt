<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Summoner's motivation to 'outshine reflection' lacks psychological depth; actions (prowling, observing) don't clearly demonstrate how their personality (enigmatic, tattered) connects to this goal. No distinct voice or emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vague narrative arc; condemned building's significance remains abstract. Family celebration interrupts momentum without clear thematic connection. Pacing uneven, with abrupt shifts between atmospheric description and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Quantum beach's surreal potential is underutilized beyond abstract descriptors. Minimal sensory engagement; 'corroded rapture' tone inconsistently applied. Setting fails to deepen themes or character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Occasional vivid imagery but lacks emotional stakes or intellectual resonance. No subtext beneath 'reflection' metaphor. Ending abandons potential for revelation. Over-reliance on ornate abstraction rather than showing through action/environment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Relies on mystic-quest tropes (summoners, haunted reflections) without subversion. Repetitive adjectives ('shimmered', 'crackled') and hollow metaphors ('corroded rapture'). Lacks stylistic coherence, veering between poetic and incoherent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements feel forcedly grafted together (quantum physics + family rituals) rather than synergistic. Thematic underdevelopment prevents emotional resonance. Style prioritizes ornamentation over narrative clarity.</comment>
