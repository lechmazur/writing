<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation feels abstract. Motivation is clear but underdeveloped, with insufficient exploration of internal conflict. Actions align with motivation but lack nuanced reactions or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot connects beginning/end thematically but feels rushed. Action drives progression, but cause-effect is only minimally explored. Pacing manages length but avoids significant dramatic tension despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting blends contrasting elements (cold/heat) effectively but uses sensory details inconsistently. Atmosphere partially supports themes - geothermal vents add texture but remain underutilized as narrative symbols.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (hermit crabs, shells) reinforce themes but lack subtextual complexity. Ending resolves character arc but avoids emotional risk. Writing style is purposeful but occasionally overwrites atmosphere at the expense of narrative drive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Originality undercut by overly abstract descriptions and predictable symbolism. Some fresh combinations (tundra orchard) but relies on generic descriptors. Emotional resonance feels curated rather than organically developed through character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements incorporated but unevenly weighted - some (hermit crabs) feel decorative rather than structural. Brief length highlights thematic ambition but weakens emotional payoff. Shows flashes of creativity but lacks cohesive execution.</comment>
