<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains flat archetype; motivations hinted through exposition rather than lived experience, with actions disconnected from stated "shaky" trait. Spider interaction reveals no new dimension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Circular structure exists but feels artificial due to rushed resolution. Pacing uneven: 200 words spent on cathedral ambiance, only 27 on the climactic amber interaction. Revelation happens off-page as summary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create evocative decaying cathedral atmosphere with artists' murals and scents, but "echoing hour" timespan remains abstract, never influencing plot mechanics or character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amber/spider symbolism (entrapment/resilience) works, but emotional impact negated by telling rather than showing. Ending's "peace" feels mandated thematically rather than earned narratively. Lacks subtext beneath surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overuses poetic filler ("carefully reckless," "improbable longing") and clich√©d metaphors. Mercenary trope remains unchallenged. Amber revelation follows predictable redemption arc without innovation. Emotional resolution feels algorithmically templated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesive surface execution but shallow thematic integration. Elements function like checklist items rather than organic components. Story exists in a liminal space between literary intention and formulaic execution without fully satisfying either.</comment>
