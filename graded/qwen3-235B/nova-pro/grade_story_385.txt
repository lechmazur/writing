<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character trait isn't demonstrated - "pleasant meddler" remains abstract, motivation lacks depth beyond stating it, actions don't clearly reveal personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot has vague progression without meaningful development - transitions between hospital observation and decision to follow footprints feel cursory, with no real stakes or consequences shown.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative descriptions but disjointed setting integration - pre-dawn hospital mood contrasts oddly with ancient skyscraper mystery without clear narrative connection.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Riddled with purple prose and generic phrases ("canvas for secrets waiting to be unraveled," "tapestry of discovery"), clich√©d mystery tropes without subversion, superficial thematic exploration stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically included - none cohere into a compelling whole, no emotional resonance, feels constrained by word limit rather than deliberately brief.</comment>
