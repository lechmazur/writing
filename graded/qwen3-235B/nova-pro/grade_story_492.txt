<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; assigned attribute never fully integrated into actions or personality; motivation to "gather illusions" feels abstract without showing its emotional weight; inconsistent portrayal between distracted and focused states; no distinct voice or interiority</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot fragments into shallow vignettes; action drives little beyond surface movements; perfunctory connection between beginning/end; concept remains unexplored thematic abstraction; cause-effect loops (e.g., "memory fuels motivation") feel tacked-on; rushed progression through secret passage to climax</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Stereotypical cyberpunk elements lack originality; atmosphere undermined by overused sensory clich√©s ("neon-lit labyrinth," "electric buzz"); setting/timeframe disconnection with broken escalator treated as isolated metaphor rather than temporal/spatial anchor; "ruthless kindness" tone remains superficially stated rather than embodied</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Virtually no emotional engagement; tired metaphors ("fractured illusions") and unearned epiphany; lacks memorable perspective or subtext; ending feels artificially momentous rather than organically achieved; narrative shows no character psychology beyond surface descriptors</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Degree of purple prose ("electric buzz of hovercars") and generic descriptors ("radiant whole"); repetitive use of "fractured" without contextual reinvention; emotional arcs rely on statement rather than subtext; narrative structure follows predictable tropes without innovation</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than interrelate; length exposes structural weaknesses rather than leveraging brevity as strength; style alternates between clinical brevity ("reached dead end") and bombastic vagueness ("forge fractured illusions into something bright")</comment>
