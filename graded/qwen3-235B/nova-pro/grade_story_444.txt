<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation is stated but not embodied through actions or internal conflict. The ambassador's fierce nature remains abstract and disconnected from her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression; repetitive phrasing "each letter" creates circularity. No clear resolution or transformation within the word limit. Action drives nothing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pervasive aquatic atmosphere with sensory details (cold water, dim light) and haunting contrast between stillness and "calm frenzy" enhance thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Powerful imagery ("tapestry of memories") but limited emotional engagement. Ending feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Prose devolves into mechanical repetition of keywords. Excessive adjectives and rhythmic uniformity suggest algorithmic structuring rather than organic storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially coexist without creating narrative synergy. The brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; no lasting emotional or intellectual resonance.</comment>
