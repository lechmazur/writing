<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation lacks depth; transformations feel abrupt. Finn's "dishonestly honest" trait isn't fully integrated into actions. Backstory dominates over active characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot struggles under competing elementsâ€”flashbacks fracture narrative flow. The "detour to avoid construction" feels arbitrarily forced. Ending achieves emotional resonance but structural coherence suffers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting described superficially; "rainforest canopy village" lacks sensory specificity. Atmospheric elements like yodels and construction sounds are underutilized. Modern/organic contrast remains conceptual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (sheet music, flame) attempt thematic depth but execution is schematic. Emotional impact diluted by passive narration ("felt", "remembered"). Momentary lyricism in duet scene overshadows uneven craft in earlier sections.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formulaic transitions between memory and present. Overuse of abstract descriptors ("gradual revelations", "earnest whimsy"). Redemptive arc feels conventionally sentimental rather than viscerally original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story prioritizes meeting element requirements over narrative cohesion. Assigned components often function as narrative obstacles rather than organic components. Lingering impression leans more on symbolic gestures than lived experience.</comment>
