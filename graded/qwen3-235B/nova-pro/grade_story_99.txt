<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is underdeveloped beyond stated traits; "strictly casual" demeanor lacks demonstration through actions; motivation drives plot but isn't deepened by it; telekinetic powers feel superfluous to characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Predictable rise-and-revive arc compressed into tight word count; chopstick wrapper's discovery hastily transitions to flashbacks; cause/effect connections between sound bites and revival lack emotional grounding; rushed conclusion sacrifices narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting described with generic decay tropes; atmosphere leans overly hard on "dust and wonder" binary without unique sensory details; chopstick wrapper's connection to lost legends feels forced rather than organically tied to setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overused metaphors ("tapestry of human experience") dilute thematic impact; ending states transformation without dramatizing inner conflict; surface-level exploration of "price of knowledge" lacks subtext; emotional resonance reduced to exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Formulaic transitions between timelines; reliance on carnival nostalgia and destiny tropes; repetitive "fragments of legends" phrasing; telekinetic powers introduced as arbitrary ability rather than story-mechanism; psychological complexity sacrificed for plot efficiency.</comment>
