<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated through actions; motivation feels abstract without sufficient emotional grounding or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lacks a traditional plot structure; the descriptive vignette format works against narrative progression or resolution within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric description (dim light, silent skeletons) but inconsistent integration of elements like the orchard dog and "brusque affection" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on poetic abstraction over resonant storytelling; symbolism often feels decorative rather than thematically integral or emotionally impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Attempts originality through surreal juxtapositions but falls into overwrought abstraction; phrases like "faithfully unfaithful" read as aestheticized contradictions rather than meaningful character beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements coexist without true cohesion; the story sacrifices narrative momentum for lyrical surface, leaving thematic underdevelopment despite ambitious concepts.</comment>
