<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict and emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through action or reaction to assigned object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Disjointed cause-effect; abrupt whale call as cue feels arbitrary. Pacing jerks between isolated tableaux without organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overly abstract descriptions like "whispers of wind" and "ancient rhythms" substitute for concrete sensory detail. Setting fails to organically intersect with plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some effective symbolism with whistle-as-legacy, but emotional resonance remains superficial. Conceptual theme is stated rather than embodied through narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies on vague mysticism clich√©s ("undercurrents of wisdom"), repetitive descriptors ("brazen calm"), and artificial dramatic tension without earned emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements present but haphazardly assembled. Short length exacerbates forced connections rather than distilling impact. Theme feels formulaic despite atmospheric flourishes.</comment>
