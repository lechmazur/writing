<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elara's ambivalence and motivation to scramble fate lack concrete grounding; character transformation feels abrupt and summary-driven, with traits often stated rather than demonstrated through actions. The object-relation to marbles is symbolic but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Linear progression lacks narrative tension. Puzzle assembly drives the plot but feels arbitrary; vague resolutions and abrupt shifts undermine coherence. Pacing prioritizes description over dramatic beats, leaving the arc underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting is minimally evocative; metallic corridors and machinery establish tone but lack sensory specificity. The colony’s environment isn’t meaningfully integrated into character or plot, rendering atmosphere thin and generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors (marbles, cosmic scoreboard) hinder emotional resonance. Theme of fragmented unity is present but diluted by exposition. Ending fails to land due to abstract "happily sad" closure; lacks subtext or sustained tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Glossy prose relies on clichéd phrases ("cosmic imbalance") and forced metaphors. The jigsaw-puzzle method feels tacked-on, betraying formulaic structure. Overwritten descriptions detract from authenticity; emotional reactions are named rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements are superficially connected but lack organic cohesion. The story leans on abstract concepts to mask narrative thinness; brevity exposes underdevelopment. Lingering impact is minimal, with thematic ideas outpacing execution.</comment>
