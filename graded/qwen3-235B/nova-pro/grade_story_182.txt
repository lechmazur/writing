<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but feels abstract rather than deeply personal; actions follow the stated hunger but lack emotional specificity or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels artificially compressed; the arc from discovery to revelation is too neatly resolved within the word limit, undermining tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere through vivid imagery (flickering projector, magnetic mountain), but sensory details often lean on clich√© descriptors rather than fresh specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in spoon and murals, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on thematic abstraction rather than grounded character reactions or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story avoids overt formula but leans on familiar motifs (heroic heir, hidden treasure) without sufficient subversion; prose occasionally slips into poetic vagueness rather than nuanced originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but rarely intersect in ways that deepen theme or character; tight constraints create a sense of mechanical assembly rather than organic cohesion.</comment>
