<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's sassiness is stated but superficial; cook aspect irrelevant to plot. Motivation declared but unexplored; actions lack nuance or emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses linearly, but relies on repetitive declarations ("chaos," "secrets") rather than organic cause/effect. Structure feels list-like, with abrupt shifts in tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere has visual flourishes (twilight, humming air) but thin sensory detail. Setting's surreal nature isn't meaningfully connected to character or action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Similes/metaphors (camera as "catalyst") are present but abstract, lacking visceral impact. Ending feels like a conclusion-by-declaration rather than earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("secrets," "chaos") and formulaic imagery (whispers, pulsing rhythms) suggest algorithmic defaults. Thematic coherence exists but lacks subversive ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but artificially assembled. Tone oscillates between poetic and didactic; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful. Lingering impression minimal.</comment>
