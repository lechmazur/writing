<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete depth; traits like "repressed" and "terrified" are repeated but not demonstrated through distinct actions or internal logic. The poet's motivations remain abstract, and his lack of dialogue/voice weakens connection to his struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot is a sequence of atmospheric vignettes rather than a structured narrative. The decisive "ambush" lacks buildup or consequence, and the ending feels imposed rather than earned. Pacing drifts between vague introspection and sudden breakthrough.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details like "twisted vines" and perfume's "haunting" presence create vivid imagery. However, overuse of florid adjectives ("canvas for the verse," "tangled beauty") and inconsistent realism (perfume scent defying time) undercuts immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric links between the poet's psyche and the setting, but emotional payoff is flattened by generalized abstractions ("doubts transformed into ink"). The theme of overcoming doubt is clear but lacks narrative specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates ("terrified of the cosmic verse he yearned to pen on mortal skin"), with clich√©d juxtapositions (cosmic vs. mortal) and artificial rhythm. Metaphors recycle predictable tropes rather than subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synthesis; the perfume bottle and "pin" moment feel arbitrarily included. The brevity highlights disjointedness rather than focus, though the metaphor-heavy style lingers as a conceptual impression.</comment>
