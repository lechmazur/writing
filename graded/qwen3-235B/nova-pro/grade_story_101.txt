<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mr. Thompson is more symbolic than developed; tenants' motivations and transformations are insufficiently explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear structure but rushed pacing, abrupt shifts (parade’s impact), and underdeveloped cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambiance is functional but lacks vivid, specific sensory details; "before first being" timeframe disrupts cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are minimally cohesive; some (parade, timeframe) feel forced, lacking depth to elevate the narrative.</comment>
