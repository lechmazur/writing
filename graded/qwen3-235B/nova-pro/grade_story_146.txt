<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict; motivation stated rather than revealed through action; inconsistent voice. The character's burden feels underexplored despite central role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rushed progression from discovery to collective action; abrupt shifts in time; minimal stakes despite high-concept elements. Pacing prioritizes plot over emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral atmosphere enhanced by tactile details like "scent of old paper," but time frame "throughout planting" creates confusion rather than coherence. Setting functions more as backdrop than active force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Relies on vague abstractions like "sacred development" rather than concrete imagery. Themes surface but aren't sustained through subtext. Ending lacks emotional payoff despite ambitious conceptual scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Bone flute and crypt evoke familiar tropes without innovation. Overused descriptors ("labyrinthine streets," "burdened gift") undermine originality. "Peaceful anger" tone remains underdeveloped and contradictory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements incorporated as checklist items rather than organic narrative components. Language feels workshopped yet inert; tension between past/present and surface/subtext under-realized.</comment>
