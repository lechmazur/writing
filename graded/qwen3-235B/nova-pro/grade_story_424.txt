<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting relies on vague adjectives ("strange," "dim") over immersive sensory details; atmospheric elements inconsistently tied to character motivations; timeframe's "shifting powers" feel disconnected from narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Conceptual themes stated overtly without subtextual depth; clich√©d metaphors ("canvas," "puzzle") fail to evoke emotion; ending offers abstract resolution without earned catharsis or lingering impact.</comment>
