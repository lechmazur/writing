<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara’s literal mind influences her methodical approach but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond functional plot needs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression via notes and overcharging is logical, but war-for-water setup feels disconnected; pacing is generally efficient but resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere is evocative but thinly sketched; sensory details exist yet underutilize the warped timeframe and haunted setting’s potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Symbolism of star maps and orb hints at deeper meaning, but emotional resonance and thematic complexity remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on genre staples (haunted lighthouse, cosmic orbs) without sufficient subversion; language is mostly purposeful but occasionally over-embellished.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but lack inventive integration; the ending’s revelation is conceptually intriguing but insufficiently profound for lingering impact.</comment>
