<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character feels like a checklist of traits—“professional cuddler” and “prejudices” are named but never embodied. No distinct voice or internal logic. Motivation is stated, not demonstrated through action or psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Plot structure is artificially segmented, mimicking progression without causal logic. Beginning and end are disconnected; “chance encounter” lacks integration. Pacing drags despite brevity, relying on vague, repetitive imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting evokes decay but lacks visceral sensory details. Atmosphere oscillates between “spaceport hangar” and “ancient novelty” without reconciling these. Tonal dissonance undermines immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Themes stated directly (“prejudices melted away”), prioritizing exposition over craft. Overused metaphors (“beacon in darkness”), no emotional subtext. Ending lacks resonance, relying on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Formulaic transitions (“as she approached,” “shadows danced”) and repetitive phrasing suggest algorithmic defaults. Relies on archetypal transformation tropes without nuance or freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Elements shoehorned in listlessly—spaceport, ticket punch, prejudice—without integration. Style is ornate yet inert; fails to leverage brevity for impact. Conceptual scaffolding exposed.</comment>
