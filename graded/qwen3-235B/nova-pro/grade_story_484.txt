<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "uniquely generic" trait remains superficial; motivation is stated but underserved by action. No distinct voice or internal conflict. Narrative leans on abstract assertions of "courage" rather than revealing character through specific choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under word constraints - protest intrudes abruptly, staircase's discoloration lacks narrative payoff. Arc resolves without meaningful challenge or transformation. Cause-effect logic stretches thin between object discovery and thematic epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere relies on clich√©d descriptors ("whispering walls") rather than visceral sensory detail. Protest/mansion juxtaposition feels conceptual rather than thematically fused. Darkness as metaphor lacks original grounding in setting mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Heavy-handed telling ("he found his purpose") undermines emotional impact. Metaphors like "canvas for his journey" feel trite rather than revelatory. No layered subtext beneath surface narrative of self-actualization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Stilted duality phrases ("flippant solemnity," "uniquely generic") showcase formulaic thinking. Protest element reads like an afterthought. Overly precise descriptors ("0.1 to 10.0 scale") suggest algorithmic pattern-following rather than organic worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Random-seeming element collision lacks cohesive vision. Breach between protest urgency and haunted mansion mysticism breaks immersion. Brevity exposes rather than enhances themes. Story ends with hollow thematic proclamations rather than earned resonance.</comment>
