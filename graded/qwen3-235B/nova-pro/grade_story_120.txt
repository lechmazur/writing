<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lack of character depth beyond stated motivations; repetitive actions don't reveal psychological complexity; no distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure but rushed progression; unclear how lure placement causes loop resolution; time constraints undermine development of cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Abstract, generalized atmosphere with minimal sensory immersion; setting functions as a vague symbolic backdrop rather than an integrated environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Some effective symbols (lure as trauma) but shallow emotional engagement; repetitive phrasing weakens thematic impact; abrupt resolution lacks earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre clich√©s (time loops, quantum settings) without subversion; formulaic descriptors ("excited boredom") feel artificial; insufficient exploration of uniquely human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ideas exceed execution; elements present but loosely interconnected; stylistic over-precision hinders readability; brief length exposes underdeveloped concepts rather than enhancing them.</comment>
