<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's superficiality feels inconsistently applied; motivation to "escape perception" drives plot but isn't meaningfully connected to his armor or knightly identity. Transformation feels narratively imposed rather than organically earned through specific actions or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Seashell's notations and booth discovery propel plot, but the transformation arc feels compressed and rushed. Cause-effect between reading notations and perception shift lacks concrete narrative steps. Pacing stalls during "encounters with other seekers" summary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Floating library's surreal atmosphere is evocatively sketched ("books drifted like clouds") but underdeveloped. Faded fortune teller's booth lacks integration with library's established rules. Sensory details about tarnished armor and seashell textures provide some immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (armor's tarnish, seashell's symbolism) convey thematic echoes about perception, but emotional resonance remains abstract. Ending's "peace transcending superficiality" feels stated rather than demonstrated through concrete character changes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Phrases like "joyful agony of his search" and "consistent miracles" verge on clich√©. The knight's contradictory "deep superficiality" isn't sufficiently unpacked. Atmospheric elements occasionally devolve into ornamental abstraction rather than serving character or plot.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in threading assigned elements, but struggles to balance mythic tone with character depth. Floating library works well as setting but feels disconnected from the booth's mundane decay. Leaves thematic questions about perception but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
