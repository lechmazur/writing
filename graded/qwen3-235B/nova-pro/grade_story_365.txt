<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Oracle's "independently dependent" trait influences her actions but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but remains abstract rather than emotionally grounded; character voice relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than specific behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic actions rather than causal logic; ring toss game's revival feels disconnected from the rope braiding method; temporal fluidity undermines narrative urgency; abrupt ending sacrifices emotional resolution for conceptual symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between decay and rebirth immerse readers; carnival's decaying grandeur effectively mirrors melancholic tone; could expand on tactile details (e.g., texture of rope, perfume residue) to deepen atmospheric impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors about memory and sacrifice resonate, but stated emotions ("bittersweet expression") undermine subtlety; ceremonial rope's symbolism is inventive but inconsistently linked to broader themes; ending achieves wistful poignancy but feels contrived.</comment>
