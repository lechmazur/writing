<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to overcome doubt is clear but inconsistently tied to actions; reactions to sea glass and microfilm lack emotional depth, leaving the trapper more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has an arc (doubt to hope), but pacing is uneven; cause-and-effect ties are vague, and the word limit forces rushed transitions between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting relies on clichéd juxtapositions (“gritty whimsy”); sensory details are sparse and inconsistently evoke atmosphere or advance character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on inspirational clichés rather than emotional resonance; metaphors (sea glass, black hole) are functional but lack subtext or surprise; ending feels expected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing (“tapestry of forgotten dreams”) and heavy-handed symbolism dominate; lacks originality and subversion, with emotional beats stated rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements feel inserted rather than integrated; thematic cohesion is weak, and the brevity highlights forced connections over organic storytelling.</comment>
