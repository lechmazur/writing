<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Guard's motivation emerges late, internal conflict feels abstract, inconsistent voice between distant narration and sudden intimacy with his thoughts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hourglass transition abrupt but effective; pacing uneven yet conveys transformation arc within constraints, though the connection between displacement of ribbon and redemption requires more narrative scaffolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>'Infernal kitchen' lacks sensory specificity beyond flames and smoke; the 'abrasive calm' exists only as a named concept rather than embodied atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism merges motif of unraveling (ribbon/hourglass) with forgiveness; the transformation sequence creates visceral emotional resonance through precise metaphoric alignment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through inventive combinations (infernal kitchen as redemption space); metaphors feel freshly imagined despite occasional ornateness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Too many elements forced into symbolic roles; stylistic precision undermines emotional urgency; the character feels like a vehicle for themes rather than a living figure.</comment>
