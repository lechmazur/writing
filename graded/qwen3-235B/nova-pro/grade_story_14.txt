<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation tied to "uncapturable essence" but lacks psychological depth. Interactions with professors feel transactional rather than revealing Finn's internal contradictions. Voice lacks distinctive naiveté.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot pivots on candle ritual climax but lacks clear stakes or transformation. The "spark before oblivion" motivation doesn't sufficiently drive cause-effect. Pacing falters in compressed timeframe with abrupt shifts between scenes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative machine-noise atmosphere contrasts poorly with underused tidal power setting. Sensory details (storm, candlelight) inconsistently tied to emotional beats. The professors' lectures lack environmental grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral power theme uses tides as functional metaphor but doesn't deepen. End's "seed of belief" lacks earned emotional weight. Writing style oscillates between lyrical and clichéd, hampering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tidal power station conceptually fresh but execution defaults to gothic tropes. "Symphony of laughter/tears" and rebellious academics feel formulaic. Purple prose ("tide's essence connection") dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically assembled rather than organically unified. Short length highlights structural gaps between concept and realization. Lingering impression is aesthetic surface over narrative depth.</comment>
