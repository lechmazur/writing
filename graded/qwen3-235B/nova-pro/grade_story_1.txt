<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lila's phobias are mentioned but not deeply integrated into her actions or decisions; her transformation lacks nuance and logical progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The high-concept elements (envelope, net, pyramid) collide awkwardly; plot momentum is stifled by abrupt transitions and underdeveloped cause-effect chains.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting relies on surface-level "ancient" tropes; minimal sensory detail or spatial logic to ground the surreal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Themes of fear/confrontation are explicit but shallow; symbolic gestures (e.g., unraveling knots) feel trite rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Predictable metaphors ("echoes," "dance with madness") and mechanical phrasing suggest algorithmic tropes; emotional beats are stated, not earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements collude through forced convenience rather than organic cohesion; brevity amplifies structural seams rather than transcending them.</comment>
