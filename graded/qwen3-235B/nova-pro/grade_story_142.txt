<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character feels flat, motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions; lacks a distinct voice despite internal monologue; emotional depth and agency remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing is uneven; excessive exposition and formulaic cause-effect weaken narrative momentum within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amusement park atmosphere is visually sketched but underdeveloped; sensory details are generic; "blurry vividness" and "realistically odd" elements lack integration with setting/character stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy-handed symbolism (roller coaster as legacy metaphor) works against subtlety; minimal emotional resonance; theme of heritage is stated rather than revealed through layered narrative craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (haunted parks, secret recipes) without subversion; robotic repetition of phrases ("journey through time," "echoing") and formulaic transitions suggest mechanical construction over authentic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Functional but derivative; elements serve checklist rather than cohesive vision; style prioritizes brevity over depth; lacks lingering thematic or emotional impact.</comment>
