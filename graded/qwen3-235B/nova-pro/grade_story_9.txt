<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot structure shows surface arc but lacks organic causality; transitions between elements feel mechanical; 13 locks resolved too abstractly to sustain narrative momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Relys on environmental clich√©s; uses AI-apparent transitions ("whisper secrets," "beacon of hope"); tone contradicts promised sarcasm; descriptors lack specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synergistic connection; forced thematic stitching; brevity doesn't feel purposeful but restrictive; leaves no lasting impression beyond surface metaphor.</comment>
