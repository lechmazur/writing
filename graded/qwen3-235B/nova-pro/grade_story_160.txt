<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lack of distinct character traits beyond vague descriptors. Motivation to "defy finality" remains abstract without personal stakes. No meaningful reactions to objects; actions feel narratively assigned rather than psychologically motivated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks cause-effect logic. Episodic structure with disconnected beats (briefcase, goggles, stage bow). Rushed progression undermines coherence. No clear narrative purpose for key actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</comment><question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Generic "abandoned" atmosphere without specific sensory immersion. Setting treated as backdrop rather than active element. Wilderness motifs inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on overused fantasy tropes ("goggles of power") without subversion. Shallow thematic treatment of finality/wonder. Ending feels abrupt rather than resonant. "Prickly wonder" reduced to repeated adjectives.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.3</grade><comment>Excessive abstract phrasing ("wilderness wisdom embedded in bumps") suggests algorithmic pattern-matching. Stated emotions over show-don't-tell, clich√©d expressions ("heart beat with wonder"), and sudden tonal shifts indicate formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Fragments of imagination drowned by forced element integration. Prose lacks stylistic consistency. Story's brevity exposes underdevelopment rather than enhancing focus. Leaves no meaningful impression.</comment>
