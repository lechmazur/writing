<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak character depth; archetypal traits (resilience, regret) are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful choices. Motivation to "hush regret" lacks visceral emotional grounding, making internal conflict feel abstract rather than earned through specific, nuanced actions or decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liminal structure (entrance/emergence) is clear but perfunctory - the "labyrinth" progression glosses over actual trials, relying on summary ("journey of joyful agony") rather than dramatized turning points. Resolution feels imposed rather than organically built within the constrained word limit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually vivid but emotionally distant. The mirrored lighthouse prison creates compelling spatial paradoxes, and the knocker's temperature contrast offers tactile immediacy. However, auditory/textural details (reef sounds, rustling metal) remain underexploited, leaving atmosphere richer than immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accomplished metaphor use (door knocker as triumph symbol) and lyrical cadences elevate the prose. However, the "strength of spirit" theme leans on truisms rather than subverting redemption arcs. The final smile feels earned yet familiar, balancing poignancy against predictability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric specificity resists generic fantasy tropes but still inhabits well-worn archetypes (knight, lighthouse prison). The central metaphor of reflection works creatively but doesn't fully transcend its surface symbolism. Avoids purple prose but occasionally substitutes ornate description for substance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Technical coherence meets baseline expectations, but the narrative skeleton shows through poetic veneer. Assigned elements are competently integrated - no glaring mismatches - yet the whole feels like skillfully arranged parts rather than organic synthesis across components like timeframe, tone, and motivation.</comment>
