<question>1</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Characters remain flat symbols rather than people; motivation to "unify" world lacks concrete emotional grounding; repeated descriptors like "bitterly optimistic" function as labels, not lived traits; heiress identity has no narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No plot, only a static sequence of thematic statements; detour leading to research station lacks causal logic; transitions between observations are arbitrary rather than progressive; word count constraint exacerbates structural incoherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Overwritten visual metaphors ("majestic migration") replace sensory immersion; xenobiology station exists as background prop without ecological logic; atmospheric contrasts between nature/science never deepen; "reckless precision" tone remains an abstract phrase rather than embodied environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on ornamental repetition rather than earned emotional resonance; symbols (parking stub) get recited rather than explored; ending circles back to earlier sentences with no new insight; excessive abstraction dilutes narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Relentlessly clich√©d phrasing ("fragments reality," "serendipitous detour") suggests algorithmic word-banking; sudden narrative pivots (lonely heiress to xenobiology collaborator) lack psychological plausibility; theme of "reckless precision" never translates into consistent stylistic or character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as isolated checklist entries rather than organic components; wordplay-driven sentences ("parking stub as her past") substitute for actual narrative integration; brevity feels enforced, not artistically chosen; thematic connections remain superficial and repetitive.</comment>
