<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and botanical obsession superficially define him; motivation for non-violence lacks emotional depth and contextual grounding, reducing psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Loose episodic structure lacks escalating stakes; crossroads resolution feels abrupt, undermining thematic tension. Assigned elements tick boxes but lack narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d urban Gothic tropes (haunted attic, whispers) without fresh sensory details; "empty abundance" remains underexploited conceptually and texturally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Predictable moral resolution flattens complexity; metaphors (botanical diversity = unity) oversimplified. Overuse of "whispers" as blunt thematic device detracts from subtler potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Formulaic haunted attic-poet pairing and whispering spirits suggest algorithmic trope recycling. Excessive repetition of timeframe markers ("between subway stops") disrupts organic flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Meets technical requirements but lacks visionary integration of elements. Story structure mimics checklist fulfillment rather than organic storytelling, leaving thematic resonance underdeveloped.</comment>
