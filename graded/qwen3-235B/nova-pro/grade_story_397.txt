<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is archetypal and underdeveloped; motivation is explicit but lacks psychological depth or transformative nuance despite clear plot catalysts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot is structurally coherent with symbolic bookends but feels artificially compressed; critical leaps (e.g., deciphering global messages) lack organic tension within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Laboratory setting offers visual contrast but fails to create immersive atmosphere; symbolic elements like crystals and fireworks remain superficially rendered without deep sensory or thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Uses conventional literary devices (fireworks as revelation) without innovation; theme of preserving knowledge hinted but remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant through subtext or character experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Relies on genre clich√©s (mysterious relic, coded maps) with predictable pacing; stylistic flourishes ("optimistic desperation") feel imposed rather than organically integrated into narrative voice or subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements fit logically but lack synergy; constrained length emphasizes structural gaps (e.g., hurried exposition about "scientists preserving knowledge") and diminishes emotional payoff despite thematic ambition.</comment>
