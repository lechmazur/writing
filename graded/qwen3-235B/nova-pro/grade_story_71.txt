<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains a vague assemblage of abstract terms; motivations stated but not dramatized; scant evidence of how "straw-stuffed form" or "fervent apathy" meaningfully shape behavior or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative progression exists but lacks causal urgency; pivotal actions (digital skewer, portal discovery) feel unearned; circular structure achieves completeness but sacrifices meaningful stakes or revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Etheral landscapes described through clich√©d abstractions without sensory grounding; "fossilized giant" and "virtual reality" function as empty set pieces rather than immersive environments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on vague poeticisms over concrete imagery; metaphors ("tapestry of indifference") are unoriginal; lacks subtext, tension, or thematic clarity; ending feels performative rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Florid language borders on purple prose; repetitive phrase patterns ("sentinel of time," "dance of shadows") suggest algorithmic defaults; some atmospheric novelty but execution lacks distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Superficial cohesion achieved through thematic repetition rather than organic integration; elements feel tick-box applied rather than artistically reimagined; brief length magnifies structural thinness.</comment>
