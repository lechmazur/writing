<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character lacks inner conflict or complexity; motivations are stated rather than organically revealed through action, rendering the selfless musician archetype one-dimensionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot is a fragmented sequence of thematic assertions rather than a narrative - lacks causal progression, pivotal moments feel arbitrary, circular structure undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vapid abstractions ("savage grace") rather than specific sensory details; the spaceship setting remains inert despite opportunities for mechanical authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heavy-handed symbolism and repetitive phrasing ("centuries of longing") substitute for genuine emotional resonance; ending circles without meaningful thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Repetitive metaphoric structures ("intangibly tangible") and formulaic transitions suggest algorithmic generation; themes are baldly stated rather than dramatized through nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements are artificially grafted together without narrative cohesion; excessive abstraction and non-organic progression negate any sense of purposeful compression.</comment>
