<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Cartographer's aloofness lacks depth; motivation to "learn the language of the soul" remains abstract. Transformation feels abrupt without concrete behavioral shifts or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on vague connections (e.g., sudden kayaking bond) and lacks cause-effect logic. Resolution feels rushed, undercutting the intended emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Futuristic mall is described with generic terms; no sensory immersion to differentiate its atmosphere or enhance emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels forced, with many assigned components existing as labels rather than narrative drivers. Lacks cohesive vision.</comment>
