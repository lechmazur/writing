<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains static with motivation stated rather than demonstrated; lacks emotional depth or transformation beyond persistent determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but execution feels rushed; cause-and-effect connections between sun patterns, symbols, and uprising remain underdeveloped; ending resolution appears abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere effectively established through visual decay and light/shadow contrasts, though 'final second of countdown' element remains purely decorative rather than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptual themes about quiet revolutions and perception have potential, but emotional resonance undermined by excessive exposition rather than dramatization of character's inner conflicts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Contains original conceptual juxtapositions ('invigorated exhaustion', spaceport mysticism) but compromised by predictable metaphors and self-congratulatory lyricism masking narrative ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Competent element integration but lacks distinctive voice or thematic cohesion; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; ideas outweigh actualized execution.</comment>
