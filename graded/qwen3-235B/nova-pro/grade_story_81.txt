<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character exists as symbolic archetype without psychological depth; motivation is clear but overly abstract and stated rather than demonstrated through tangible conflicts or nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot functions as a static vignette lacking dramatic tension or progression; circular structure from discovery to vow creates closure but minimal narrative momentum within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ethereal tone and time-warped setting are evocatively rendered through precise sensory details about texture/decay, though futuristic nostalgia remains superficially juxtaposed rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive metaphoric abstraction ("pools of ancient wisdom," "tapestry of human experience") substitutes for emotional resonance; lyrical prose obscures deeper thematic exploration or memorable character voice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on overwrought descriptive patterns ("centuries-old coin nestled within grain," "living testament") and explicitly stated emotions; lacks stylistic idiosyncrasy or subversive handling of time-manipulation tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack alchemical synthesis; formal precision cannot compensate for lack of visceral impact, narrative surprise, or lingering philosophical interrogation beneath poetic surfaces.</comment>
