<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's transformation feels abrupt; motivation for artistic awakening via mitten lacks psychological depth; "lawfully rebellious" trait inconsistently applied; actions supporting altars don't clearly emerge from established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Loose connective tissue between collecting remedies and altar-building; abrupt shifts from deserted intersection to populated scene; cause-effect of mitten's influence underdeveloped; pacing uneven despite tight arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Jarring juxtaposition of "secret agent center" sterility with mystical altars; sensory details often generic; time setting establishes mood but doesn't deepen concept; object-setting relationship feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stated themes outweigh demonstrated emotional impact; some compelling imagery (mitten as catalyst) but undercut by tell-not-show approach; ending feels artificially triumphant without earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on redemption-through-art trope without subversion; metaphors feel over-explained; language oscillates between poetic affectation and flat exposition; emotional progression seems artificially imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist items rather than narrative necessities; story lacks organic momentum; promising ideas (artistic rebellion) diluted by rushed execution; fails to transform constraints into artistic advantages.</comment>
