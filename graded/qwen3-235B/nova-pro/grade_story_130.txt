<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation for self-acceptance is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior; reactions to objects lack emotional depth despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; reverse-engineering the nest drives momentum unevenly, with underdeveloped cause-effect transitions (e.g., sudden transformation of nest into a cosmic map).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interstellar orchard ship offers vivid visual potential, but atmospheric details (e.g., scents of alien fruit, texture of trees) are underexploited; tone shifts inconsistently between whimsy and gravitas.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses nested metaphors effectively (wisdom as threads, journeys as maps); ending feels emotionally resonant but slightly didactic, undercutting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Phrases like "static-laden confessions" verge on purple prose; device-driven structure avoids common tropes but relies excessively on abstract, floating imagery without visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but predictably; premise feels more like a framework for poetic language than a fully inhabited narrative world with internal logic.</comment>
