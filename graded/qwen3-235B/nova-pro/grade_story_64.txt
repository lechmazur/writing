<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alchemist's uncertainty and wildness are stated but not consistently demonstrated through nuanced choices or inner conflict; motivation for immortality remains superficially explored despite driving plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Arc from acquisition to immortality exists but feels rushed; transitions between marketplace, forest, and fountain lack causal cohesion; judge's verdict remains unexplained, undermining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Marketplace's "balloon-tethered" stalls create visual intrigue, but sensory details are uneven—floating atmosphere contrasts with underdeveloped forest perils; tone inconsistent between mundane magic and existential stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Imagery (cracked scale's glow, coded scuffs) elevates craft, but predictable theme of immortality sacrifices lacks subtext; ending prioritizes closure over emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mixed originality—the floating market is inventive, but "forest trails to immortality" and alchemist tropes lean formulaic; purple prose ("centuries-old marble floor") occasionally distracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere without deep integration; brevity hinders thematic depth; style oscillates between lyrical and clichéd, limiting lasting impact.</comment>
