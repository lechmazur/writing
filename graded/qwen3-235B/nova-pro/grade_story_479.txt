<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth despite intriguing traits; motivation to preserve practices is stated but not emotionally earned. The brass tape's significance overshadows nuanced exploration of Alistair's internal conflicts or desires.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of challenge/resolution within tight constraints, but the conflict feels artificially simple. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally meanders without sufficient tension to justify its duration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting is name-dropped (social network archive) but remains functionally abstract. No sensory details or logical consistency to ground the world; the archive's digital/physical paradox is unexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mixed use of metaphor: paint as memory works conceptually but lacks visceral impact. The ending attempts thematic resonance ("myth of ordinariness") that feels imposed rather than organically derived from the narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Stilted prose ("jubilant remorse," "digital ether") and inconsistent tone suggest artificial construction. Overreliance on poetic abstraction fails to make emotional stakes tangible; feels like decorative scaffolding over hollow core.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements are superficially cohesive but mechanically assembled. The premise teases intriguing paradoxes (preservation in digital spaces, generational legacy) but settles for facile resolutions rather than dissecting their complexity.</comment>
