<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Premise-driven with superficial traits. "Skillfully incompetent" exists as label without narrative integration. Character declares purpose but lacks psychological depth or evolving motivation despite stated resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Minimal but functional arc framed by two resonant images (shard & chisel). Pacing uneven – sculptor interaction feels rushed, abduction lacks tangible stakes. Concept-to-plot connection tenuous despite clean bookends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Sensory details superficially "dusty attic" generic. Clockwork animals symbolic potential wasted – ticking noise only mechanical contributor. Temperature, texture, scent absent. Setting divorced from emotional or plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Empty metaphors ("symphony of time") without earned resonance. Thematic intent (self-deception vs purpose) stated rather than dramatized. Ending rings hollow – no evidence of changed world or character. Conflict lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Machine-generated cadence in descriptive passages. "Fire in eyes," "heart pounded" clichés undercut original elements. Uneven specificity – marble carving detailed, but "forgotten dreams" left amorphous. Tension between ambition and execution typical of algorithmic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements checked off list rather than organically combined. Brevity exposes structural weaknesses – underdeveloped concept-method relationship, symbolic objects without payoff. Style oscillates between pretentious ("last vestige") and barren. Leaves no lasting impression.</comment>
