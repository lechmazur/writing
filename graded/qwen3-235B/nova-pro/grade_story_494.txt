<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Superficial character arc lacks psychological depth; traits are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful action. Motivation "to deliver a spark" feels abstract rather than earned through specific behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on arbitrary declarations ("authorize his fate") rather than organic development. Sudden shifts between contemplation and decisive action disrupt narrative logic within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Surreal, generalized descriptions ("symphony of colors") lack tactile specificity. Setting functions as vague backdrop rather than active participant. "Harsh tenderness" remains undeveloped through sensory contradiction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Predictable metaphorical machinery (shackled chains, sparks) outweighs emotional resonance. Overuse of abstract nouns ("gravity of decision") prioritizes concept over lived experience. Ending feels formulaically inspirational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on ornate abstraction and clich√©d symbolism (tapestry as potential). Mechanical repetition of "between breaths" suggests algorithmic pattern recognition rather than thematic intentionality. Emotional beats feel pre-scripted rather than authentically rendered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements forced into symbolic roles strain narrative cohesion. Length emphasizes style over substance. Lingering impression stems from archetypal structure rather than inventive execution.</comment>
