<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paper-thin character defined by labels rather than lived experience; motivation to "chronicle social changes" feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically integrated into actions or psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as a checklist of elements with mechanical progression; improvisation drives the tire change but key connections (spice box/echo chamber/revelation) feel unearned and episodic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Generic desolation with superficial sensory details; atmosphere lacks consistency, shifts abruptly from pragmatic (flat tire) to mystical (echo chamber).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vague attempts at metaphorical depth undermined by didacticism; ending states "soul’s revelation" without earned emotional resonance or thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Clichéd phrasing ("dance of purpose," "intense nonchalance") and checklist-driven structure betray algorithmic construction; shallow engagement with themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements function like mismatched gears forced into a machine; no evidence of creative synthesis or narrative ambition beyond obligation fulfillment.</comment>
