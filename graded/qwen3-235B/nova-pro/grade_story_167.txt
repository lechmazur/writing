<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped character with stated but not deeply explored internal conflicts. Motivation is clear but lacks nuance, making the scholar feel more like a narrative instrument than a fully realized figure. No distinct vocal identity or concrete emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear structure exists but feels compressed. Plot points follow logically but lack depth due to constraints. Pacing uneven – pivotal moments underdeveloped, resolution abrupt. Completion is minimal, with arc elements implied rather than realized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere builds through sparse but effective sensory details, but the setting’s potential is underutilized. Connections between the time-travel theme, capsule hotel, and conceptual elements remain superficial. The tone leans solemn but lacks distinctive texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor effectively, but lacks unique stylistic imprint. Theme of untold stories resonates, but emotional weight is diluted by vague abstractions. The ending lacks resonance due to underdeveloped character relationships and stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Reliance on poetic abstraction risks pretension. Some original concepts undermined by repetitive phrasing and generic emotional cues (“heart heavy,” “weight of actions”) without visceral embodiment. Formulaic character reasoning and overly ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Shows effort to integrate elements but lacks cohesion. Conceptual framework is evident but execution feels compressed. Some creativity in combining time travel with forbidden narratives, but final impact remains diffuse and unsatisfyingly abstract.</comment>
