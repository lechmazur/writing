<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond symbolic gestures; motivation is clear but under-explored through meaningful reactions to assigned elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels compressed; transitions between reflection and revelation lack organic build within tight constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements service concept superficially; brevity works for mood but not sustained narrative cohesion or thematic complexity.</comment>
