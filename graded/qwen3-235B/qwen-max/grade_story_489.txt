<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Unseen observer's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; lacks emotional depth despite aligning with actions; "aggressively kind" trait inconsistently demonstrated; minimal character voice due to narration style</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Whistle's use effectively drives plot; connection between dancer's action and observer's response feels arbitrary; complete arc within word count but pacing uneven during supernatural summoning sequence</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse vividly rendered through salt, fog, and sounds; atmosphere perfectly matches "brazen calm" tone; dancer timeframe element disrupts otherwise cohesive setting</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery with whale-song resonance; theme of preserving cultural memory emerges organically; ending successfully weaves ritual restoration with oceanic mythology; subtext elevates surface narrative</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Creative reimagining of "fling" as sound propagation; avoids genre clich√©s with seaweed-cloaked keepers; maintains consistent tone without purple prose; precise environmental details avoid generic descriptors</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively despite artificial constraints; dancer's timeframe most distracting element; lighthouse as narrative anchor provides necessary grounding; lingering questions about cultural memory resonate beyond text</comment>
