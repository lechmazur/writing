<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation is hinted at but remains nebulous; character's actions lack psychological nuance, and the prophetic role feels underspecified. Dialogue reveals little about internal conflict beyond surface despair.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Narrative oscillates between locales without sufficient connective tissue; abrupt scene transitions undermine cohesion. The "glimmering transitions" concept is mentioned but not operationalized in plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vivid but disjointed sensory details fail to unify; the giant's study and laundromat settings lack integration. Atmospheric elements like "haunting delight" feel imposed rather than emergent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mixed metaphors occasionally resonate but often feel overstated. The ending gestures toward theme without earned revelation; emotional beats rely partially on stated "regret" versus demonstrated behavior.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Excessive ornamentation ("haunting delight") and clich√©d symbols (wilted flower) undermine originality. Dialogue adheres to trope-adjacent structures despite mostly avoiding outright predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially present but unevenly woven; prose displays stylistic ambition yet insufficient editorial rigor. The laundromat-giant's study dichotomy suggests conceptual scaffolding over organic narrative.</comment>
