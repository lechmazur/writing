<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond singular obsession; motivation is clear but underdeveloped through action. Emotional reactions feel stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented pacing due to word limit; cause-effect progression stilted in places. The "chain-reactive coincidences" method is vaguely executed, weakening structural logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends mundane (suburbia) and surreal (tar pit), but sensory details remain surface-level. Sulfur/sweetness contrast is effective but underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mild emotional resonance; symbolism (butterfly, coin) hints at themes but lacks layering. Ending feels rushed rather than contemplative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Formulaic elements (cryptic grandparent legacy, alchemist trope) undercut originality. Some similes generic ("paradox that unsettled him") and tone inconsistency around "desperate hope."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story attempts depth but strains under element overload. Premise intrigues but execution uneven; thematic cohesion undercut by word-count constraints and forced logic.</comment>
