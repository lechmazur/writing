<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has emotional depth but reactions to assigned elements (like the drawer knob) lack complexity; motivation is clear but the 'voice' remains overly generalized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is rudimentary—beginning and end connect via symbolic movement, but pacing drags in middle; action of 'organizing memories' feels abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on flat sensory details (e.g., "prismatic lake" lacks specificity); setting and tone clash in the underdeveloped contrast between the lake’s beauty and Lila’s anguish.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors and emotional resonance in the climax, but ending feels artificially tidy; theme of guilt’s resolution is underinterrogated, leaning on clichéd catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some originality in symbolic objects (drawer knob) but relies on predictable tropes (guilt, redemption arcs); language avoids purple prose but lacks distinctive voice or stylistic ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack narrative innovation; the short form feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with themes resolved too neatly for depth.</comment>
