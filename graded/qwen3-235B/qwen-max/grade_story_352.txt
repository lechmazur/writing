<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to preserve music is clear and action-aligned, but lacks depth beyond determination. The tattered bookmark meaningfully connects to her struggle, though her “feral” trait remains underexplored. Third-person limits distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc (entering factory → preserving songs → sacrifice), but the tight word limit leaves the ending’s emotional weight underdeveloped. The method of navigating by sound is clever but underutilized, and cause-effect logic holds despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is richly immersive: vats of reactive ink, suspended scrolls, and silence-as-crafting-tool evoke a tactile, haunting mood. The factory’s secrecy mirrors the theme of hidden traditions, though the “feral” nomad’s physical presence in the world feels minimally sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as memory, sacrifice as preservation) are poignant, and the act of writing songs into existence via personal loss is haunting. Ending balances tragedy and triumph. Avoids overt telling, but relies slightly on “dying ember” clichés to convey urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid originality in ink-reactive criteria (tears, moonlight) and sound-as-navigation. Avoids overt purple prose but has fleeting ornate phrasing (“hummed with invisible ink”). The nomad’s lack of emotional nuance (beyond resolve) leans AI-generic at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are generally cohesive—setting, object, and motive interlink—but some (e.g., “feral” trait, “blithe discontent”) feel accessory. The concept’s brevity hints at depth but leaves themes (sacrifice, erasure) less fully realized. Lingers as a vignette.</comment>
