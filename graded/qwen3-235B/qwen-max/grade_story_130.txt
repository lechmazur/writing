<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Apprentice's internal conflict is palpable, but her voice lacks distinctiveness beyond melancholic introspection. Motivation (self-acceptance) resonates thematically but feels more implied than deeply embodied through specific actions beyond nest-building.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Minimalist structure conveys emotional arc effectively within constraints. Nest as symbolic object and phone confessions as catalyst create coherent progression. Pacing avoids rushing but could expand on resolution phase to deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orchard ship offers rich metaphorical potential with alien-grown fruit and artificial stars. Sensory details (crunching leaves, flickering phone static) immerse without overloading. Tone-technology contrast (cordless phone in space) slightly disrupts otherwise evocative atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nest-as-self metaphor and fractured wholeness theme add subtext. Emotional resonance emerges through tactile rebuild process rather than exposition. Ending avoids trite resolution by embracing imperfect wholeness. Writing occasionally leans into abstract poetics over concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interstellar botanist premise shows ingenuity but borrows from "wanderer in space" tropes. Phone confessions risk feeling contrived (tech anachronism) but provide narrative necessity. Sensory details avoid generic descriptors, though tone shifts from melancholy to hopeful might benefit from smoother transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coheres around central metaphor despite tight constraints. Elements serve thematic unity more than narrative innovation, but lean prose and symbolic economy suggest deliberate brevity. Leaves lingering reflection on trauma and reconstruction.</comment>
