<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has clear traits (daring, defiant) and motivation (confronting prejudice), but depth is superficial; internal conflict hinted at but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc present (entering maze, confronting past, facing shadow figure), but pacing feels rushed in midsection; thematic resolution abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere via shifting mirrors and cosmic whispers, but dying tree/orchard cat details lack integration; sensory details evocative but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (broken glass reflecting self-doubt) and layered conflict, but emotional resonance diluted by overly poetic descriptions; theme of defiance is clear but lacks nuanced exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (cosmic echoes as psychological warfare) but relies on familiar "mirror-maze-as-inner-conflict" trope; rope symbolism effective but underdeveloped; prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (prejudice, defiance) but some feel imposed (orchard cat’s relevance vague); tight word count sacrifices emotional depth; ending ambitious but underwhelming.</comment>
