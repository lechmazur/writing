<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character shows basic motivation (proving himself) and internal conflict, but lacks depth beyond surface traits. Actions align with motivation but emotional resonance remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from receiving the doll to activating it, but pacing feels rushed in critical emotional moments. Connections between elements are logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes sci-fi and rural elements intriguingly but relies on vague descriptors like "dusty console" rather than immersive sensory details or emotional resonance with the location.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses symbolic elements (doll, runes) effectively to hint at themes, but relies on explicit exposition ("Heritage") rather than subtext. Ending establishes plot momentum but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Combines sci-fi and magic elements with moderate originality, but "misdelivered packages" and heritage reveal lean on familiar tropes. Avoids overt clich√©s but offers few subversions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Maintains cohesion among assigned elements but fails to fully integrate them thematically. Short length constrains development rather than enhancing focus.</comment>
