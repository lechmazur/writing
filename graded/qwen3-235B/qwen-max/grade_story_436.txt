<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elaborate backstory exists, but motivation (exile origins) is externally revealed rather than organically manifested through character actions. Emotional depth remains surface-level despite poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Urgency from library closure creates momentum, but reliance on expository vision-telling undermines plot autonomy. Revelation resolution feels narratively convenient rather than structurally earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative terms lack cohesive sensory integration; floating fortress concept inconsistently interacts with polymer plastic and desert motifs. Atmospheric elements remain disconnected set pieces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Oracular revelation contains thematic potential, but emotional impact diluted by passive character agency. Literary devices like "dream catchers" operate as symbolic MacGuffins rather than meaningful metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Formulaic genre tropes (ancient secrets, floating prisons) dominate. Emotional states often stated rather than demonstrated. Inconsistent material logic (plastic spoon + mystical recipes) suggests artificial juxtaposition rather than organic worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Functional narrative cohesion maintained within constraints, but assigned elements frequently operate in parallel rather than interconnection. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution in terms of thematic integration.</comment>
