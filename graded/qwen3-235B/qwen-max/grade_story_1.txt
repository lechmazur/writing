<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psychology; stunt-double profession never justifies phobia-ridden behavior. Distinguishing between "obsession" and "motivation" muddies internal logic. Emotional arc lacks progression from start to finish.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overreliance on unexplained transitions (garage sales to pyramid journey). Unknotting process lacks clear temporal markers. Symbolic resolution feels abrupt—aforementioned "shouting languages" skipped crucial decoding steps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative texture work in pyramid's metallic tang and net's "hum," but tonal inconsistencies between "mundanely spiritual" envelope and hallucinogenic library. Visual contrast between "garage sale rust" and "time-shadowed pyramid" underserved.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (threads binding humanity) emerge too late to rescue repetitive "descent-into-madness" arc. Overuse of abstract descriptors ("profound," "numb," "fragility") dilutes emotional specificity. Central conflict dissolves with cheap epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Repetitive adjective clusters ("ancient dust," "false wall"). Fisherman's net symbolism borrows heavily from Borges' labyrinths without innovation. Subtext about human connection feels tacked-on rather than organically built through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Element synergy superficial—"garage sales" exist solely to justify envelope discovery. Pyramid's library functions as aesthetic window dressing, not narrative necessity. Emotional ending rings hollow after clinical progression through required plot points.</comment>
