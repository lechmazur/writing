<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains largely static; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Assigned trait "nostalgic" influences surface details but lacks psychological depth. Actions driven more by plot necessity than internal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks cohesion; key revelations about betrayal feel tacked on. Pacing uneven - telescopes and crystal growth introduced without clear dramatic payoff. Attempts at thematic resolution in caves feel underdeveloped within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually vivid but emotionally unearned. Sensory details about cracked consoles and crystal pulsations work, but connections between setting decay and character/plot mechanics remain superficial. Dawn imagery lacks symbolic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Impressive descriptive language, but emotional impact diluted by heavy exposition. Some effective metaphors (crystals as "almost alive"), but subtext about human ambition feels simplistic. Ending lacks satisfying narrative closure or meaningful ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Strong evidence of formulaic writing - "cracked control panels" and "whispers of past arguments" feel like stock dystopia tropes. Overly ornate descriptions ("nostalgic warmth that betrayed its age") verge on purple prose. Android's "calculated panic" demonstrates artificial emotional logic rather than human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding overwhelms narrative; elemental connections feel mechanical rather than organic. Attempts at thematic depth about ambition undercut by superficial treatment. Some intriguing concepts (crystals feeding on failed experiments) introduced too late to resonate meaningfully.</comment>
