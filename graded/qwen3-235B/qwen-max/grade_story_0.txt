<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character displays sheepishness through physical gestures but lacks psychological depth; motivation to prove himself through charm is clear but insufficiently tied to the analytically creative method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but resolution feels perfunctory; cause-effect between light/refracted memories and monster's change lacks visceral logic despite effective pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative textures in lamp's colors and cathedral ruins compensate for underdeveloped pattern recognition center setting; atmosphere consistently supports tone through sensory contrasts.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but with uneven integration; brief length enhances tension between immediacy of encounter and backstory's weight; leaves question about memory's redemptive power.</comment>
