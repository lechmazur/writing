<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation for documenting vanishing trades is clear but underexplored psychologically; "skewed visionary" trait influences actions superficially without deep character complexity; reactions to hieroglyphs lack emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Time-travel framework drives plot logically, but pacing feels compressed; historical vignettes lack structural tension; reality cracks abrupt, diminishing cumulative impact within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends scientific and historical elements with tactile details (e.g., wooden floors, molten iron), though modern lab's temporal anomaly setting remains underexploited; tone consistently captures "mundane miracles" in preserved rituals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subtext about cultural erosion resonates; metaphor of fragmented pottery as time-map is evocative; understated conflict between preservation and temporal instability creates lingering unease despite uneven pacing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative avoids overt formulaicity but occasionally relies on familiar time-travel tropes; descriptions like "vivid dyes" and "molten iron" remain specific; emotional stakes communicated through actions rather than explicit declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack thematic density; botanical sketches feel functionally symbolic rather than narrative drivers; length obscures character depth but allows atmospheric snapshots.</comment>
