<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Kael’s actions lack nuance despite consistent archival drive. Conceptual traits (e.g., "translated love") remain abstract without tangible characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; relies on lyrical reflection over coherent events. The apple’s fall signals closure but isn’t thematically or causally pivotal enough to anchor structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal, inconsistent setting blending (desert/spaceship/orchard) creates visual tension but underutilizes sensory detail. Atmosphere leans on abstract lyricism over immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolism (ruler, emotional maps) elevate thematic resonance. Lacks emotional urgency; ending feels abrupt but conceptually aligned with the "unfinished journey" motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept juxtaposes well but execution veers into abstraction. Avoids cliché but occasionally drifts into intellectualized "pretentious" territory without humanizing its abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competently cohesive but sacrifices narrative tension for poetic texture. Elements serve thematic goals unevenly; brevity works structurally but limits emotional payoff.</comment>
