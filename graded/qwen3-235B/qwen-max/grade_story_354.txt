<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to chase auroras is vague, underdeveloped beyond surface curiosity; daring compassion is shown but not deeply rooted in nuanced personality traits; lacks distinctive voice and psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically via chase-driven structure; cyclical connection between auroras at start/end provides coherence; pacing is efficient but transitions occasionally feel rushed or under-explored within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</comment><question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting evokes vivid digital surrealism with sensory details (shimmering walls, aurora hues); atmosphere of "elegant chaos" established but unevenly sustained throughout narrative flow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (teddy bear as legacy vessel) and theme of memory preservation carry emotional weight; literary devices effective but not transcendent; ending delivers purposeful thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original integration of VR/wizardry concepts undercut by AI-trope tendencies (cosmic disclaimers, lost civilizations); tone remains consistent despite occasional purple prose and insufficiently subverted tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine with moderate creativity; some components (teddy bear's significance) excel while others (character depth, lore) weaken cohesion; narrative leaves thematic traces but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
