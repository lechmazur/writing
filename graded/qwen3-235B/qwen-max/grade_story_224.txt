<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s motivation for transformation is clear but inner conflict lacks nuanced development; reactions to objects don’t fully explore psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a cohesive arc but pacing falters—climax feels abrupt, and the meteorite method lacks organic integration with earlier setup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified short piece, though some elements feel assigned rather than organically developed within the constraints.</comment>
