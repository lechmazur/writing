<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks psychological depth; "capriciously consistent" trait is inconsistently demonstrated beyond surface-level determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows internal logic and achieves arc within constraints, but the piano method's mechanics feel underdeveloped; conclusion satisfies premise despite rushed transformation sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, though the glass desert's mystical properties remain superficially explained; monarch butterfly enhances atmosphere more than plot integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original use of piano patterns and glass desert avoids genre tropes; avoids excessive ornamentation while maintaining poetic clarity; minor overreliance on "tarnished" imagery slightly diminishes impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole despite occasional uneven execution; tone remains consistent; ending invites reflection but feels inevitable rather than surprising.</comment>
