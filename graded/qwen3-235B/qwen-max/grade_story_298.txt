<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "rationally impulsive" are underdeveloped; motivations feel abstract rather than deeply personal. Emotional honesty in performances isn't sufficiently differentiated from generic artistic dedication.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but contrived—the hidden chamber and note feel like narrative shortcuts. Pacing is uneven; the resolution resolves too neatly for a post-apocalyptic setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (smell of jasmine, fractured light) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. The blending of imperial history and ecological collapse is evocative but underexploited thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through symbolic objects (the dress) and Liang's reverence, but themes of resilience feel somewhat overstated rather than organically revealed through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some poetic imagery elevates the prose, but phrases like "pulse with life" and "raw truth" verge on cliché. Emotional nuance is occasionally sacrificed for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ghosts-of-past-and-present framing adds depth, but the story leans on familiar tropes of lost children and redemptive art. Cohesion across elements is functional rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
