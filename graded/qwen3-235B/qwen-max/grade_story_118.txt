<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Therapist’s role and rituals are distinct, but the agent’s psychology remains underexplored despite impactful dialogue. Interactions lack layered motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structural coherence exists within the vignette constraints, but lacks a dynamic progression—ends where it begins emotionally, relying on a static, poetic moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory atmospherics and symbolic settings (dim lighting, wax shapes) deepen mood, but the secret agent milieu feels arbitrarily juxtaposed against its mystical elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (wax as psyche, sound of hindsight) resonate with haunting precision. Ending achieves emotional and thematic closure, though subtlety occasionally verges on obscurity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unique fusion of sci-fi (hive-mind) and occult (wax divination) avoids clichés, but some phrases ("molten wax pooling") risk purple prose. Nuanced tone but uneven stylistic restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive under a surreal, introspective lens, but the secret agent framework feels like window-dressing. Strong imagery elevates brevity’s constraints.</comment>
