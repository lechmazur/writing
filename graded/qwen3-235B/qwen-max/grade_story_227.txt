<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arc is underdeveloped; obsession lacks emotional grounding beyond surface 'personal' rationale. Unique 'voice' diluted by overly poetic abstractions rather than distinct speech patterns or internal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Countdown motif hints at structure but fails to deliver payoff. Pacing uneven: excessive introspection interrupts momentum, while critical plot mechanisms (sun tracking) feel abruptly inserted rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d 'decaying futuristic' tropes without fresh sensory specificity. The spaceport's metaphorical resonance is stated rather than demonstrated through concrete details that might evoke its former vibrancy vs. current stagnation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors about time/inertia have conceptual merit but execution leans on exposition over visceral imagery. Ending claims 'map' revelation lacks earned emotional weight. Subtext about control remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avant-garde elements (dream symbology through microscope) combat generic melancholic tone. However, phrases like 'heatwaves in his mind' and 'fragile grasp on reality' veer toward literary autopilot rather than distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Element integration remains mechanical. While compactness serves thematic focus on stasis, the ending feels like arbitrary truncation rather than purposeful culmination. Lingering impression is conceptual rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
