<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation to protect the bird is clear and drives action, but traits like "submissive" lack depth as he acts decisively. Inner conflict hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent with logical cause-effect, but climax feels rushed; letter opener’s underutilization weakens payoff. Pacing uneven in spots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mixes aristocratic estate with surreal espionage elements, creating unique tension. Inconsistent tone between whimsical and dark; sensory details evocative but uneven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of vulnerability through the bird is effective. Dialogue reveals subtext. Ending resolves conflict but lacks emotional resonance or thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but combines tropes (secret agents, silent hero) without full originality. Some details feel generic; tone shifts occasionally jarring. No purple prose but limited stylistic distinctness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Elements form a functional arc but lack cohesion. Length feels restrictive; some choices (workshop’s existence) strain plausibility despite creative ambition.</comment>
