<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character shows surface-level evolution; aloofness shifts abruptly to courage without nuanced internal conflict. Motivation is stated but not fully earned through action. The stones and photos elicit emotion, but Kael's detachment remains inconsistently portrayed during pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot is structurally coherent but relies on compressed symbolism to imply closure. Garage cleaning as a timeframe anchors the narrative, yet the gravitational anomaly and photo discovery feel hastily integrated, diluting cause-effect logic and pacing balance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gravitational anomalies create a haunting, surreal atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "softly audible stones") immerse readers, but the setting’s peculiarity isn’t fully woven into the emotional arc or plot stakes, leaving tonal dissonance between mundane and fantastical.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory and adaptation resonate, but emotional impact is muted by overt symbolism. The ending suggests resolution without earning catharsis. Metaphors (stones=resilience) are effective but lack subtextual complexity; showing over telling is partially achieved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on orphan trope, cryptic tickets, and "adapt or perish" clichés without reimagining them. Sensory details occasionally border on generic ("cool surfaces"). Gravitational anomalies and abrupt emotional shifts suggest formulaic transitions rather than organic narrative choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements form a serviceable framework but lack integration depth. The lottery ticket and gravity distortions feel like narrative shortcuts rather than essential components. The brevity works for mystery but sacrifices emotional resonance and thematic richness.</comment>
