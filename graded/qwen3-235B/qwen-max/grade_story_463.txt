<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's dry wit is mentioned but not consistently demonstrated through distinct voice or actions. Motivation to learn traditional methods through confiscation is vaguely tied to eroding promises without fully explored emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Confiscation action lacks clear progression. Beginning and end connected by symbolism but plot coherence falters under word constraints. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Salt-crusted decay, mildew, and ghostly presence create visceral, haunting atmosphere. Sensory details strongly align with eroded promises theme. Setting and concept reinforce each other.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (rope, dance) evoke layered meaning. Emotional resonance undercut by exposition ("memory, history, defiance"). Ending resolves arc without delivering transformative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages contrast with abrupt tonal shifts ("shook her head sharply"). Dance method feels underdeveloped, bordering on clich√©d defiance trope. Language occasionally veers toward ornate description without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated. Atmosphere and symbolic rope strongest. Certain plot motivations feel imposed rather than organic. Lingers conceptually but lacks emotional stickiness.</comment>
