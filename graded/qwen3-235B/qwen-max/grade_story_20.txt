<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s disappointment and tarnished comb establish history, but motivation to chronicle social movements feels underexplored; transformation lacks sufficient nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but pacing uneven—bridge crossing dominates, backstory intrudes abruptly. Celestial timeframe signals resolution but feels tacked on.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is melancholic and evocative (inverted waterfall, creaking bridge), but sensory details are sparse; the setting’s symbolic resonance is inconsistently realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (comb, upward water) deepen theme; ending achieves emotional resonance. Subtext about confronting personal failure elevates narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Combines surreal elements with introspection effectively but relies on familiar melancholic tropes (tournaments won, friendships lost); prose occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are functional but unevenly integrated; celestial timeframe and bridge feel imposed rather than organic. Writing is competent but lacks distinctive stylistic risk-taking.</comment>
