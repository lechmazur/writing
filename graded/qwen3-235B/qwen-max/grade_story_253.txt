<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth; traits like "eloquently silent" and "shattered allegiances" hinted at rather than demonstrated through specific, humanized behavior; actions toward goals not fully earned within limited space.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Opening establishes setting efficiently, but harp's sudden intrusion disrupts pacing; forced transition from tension to resolution; abrupt shifts between reality-warping and character contemplation undermine cohesion in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the dystopian aesthetic, but setting serves mostly decorative purpose; thematic connection between "electric wilderness" and character's internal conflicts remains underexplored; atmosphere inconsistently tied to narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (chip as time, harp as truth) offer intellectual resonance, but emotional engagement remains superficial; ending suggests thematic ambition without satisfying depth; "showing" through action exists but feels calculated rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in blending tech-organic motifs undercut by clich√©d descriptors ("flickering data streams," "fractal patterns"); inconsistent emotional nuance in character reactions; harp scene feels like AI-generated surrealism rather than purposeful symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Premise remains cohesive despite multiple elements, but some (harp, timeframe) feel arbitrarily inserted rather than thematically necessary; style occasionally enhances tone but frequently drifts into ornate abstraction; short length exposes underdeveloped arcs.</comment>
