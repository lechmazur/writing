<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's duality between apathy and defiance is established but lacks deeper exploration of internal conflict; motivation to "overcome himself" drives actions but remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows clear meteor-guided progression toward mist-shrouded peak; pacing is efficient but transitions to supernatural hum feel under-explained, slightly disrupting momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Floating monastery and meteor symbolism create strong atmosphere; sensory details like vibrating stone and whipping wind immerse reader, though monks' resignation feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "weary hero" trope; metaphors about flames and maps are serviceable but not strikingly original; emotional gravity is hinted more than shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with monastery and meteors serving multiple narrative functions; concise style works for contemplative tone, though thematic depth feels truncated by short form.</comment>
