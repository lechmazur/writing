<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation but lacks depth in emotional complexity or internal conflict; moral code is present yet underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but feels truncated; the discovery of the rake handle and resolution with the name "Valeria" provide structure, yet the arc remains underdeveloped within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid neon-Roman hybrid imagery establishes atmosphere, but sensory detail is uneven; the setting occasionally feels decorative rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory and resistance add resonance, but emotional impact is muted; the ending hints at stakes without fully crystallizing them.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mix of dystopian and historical elements avoids overt clich√©s, though some tropes (erased rebel leader, hacker with a code) are conventional; the puzzle mechanic feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but underdelivered; elements intersect serviceably but lack transformative synergy; ending raises questions without sufficient payoff.</comment>
