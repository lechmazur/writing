<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits are surface-level; motivations stated rather than revealed through nuanced action. The trapper's mechanical intuition and guardianship lack deep integration into specific decisions or emotional conflicts, relying on exposition over embodied behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear mystery-seeking arc but lacks momentum. The abrupt ending with the old man's exit feels unresolved rather than purposeful, weakening closure despite the tight word count. Pacing favors atmosphere over narrative drive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner's sensory details ("neon lights flickering," "hum of machinery") and the boarded-up schoolhouse as a symbol of decayed tradition create vivid, contrasting settings. Weakness: underexplored connection between the diner's "organized disorder" and the schoolhouse's secrecy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Literary devices like the die as a symbol of chance vs. calculation are effective but underdeveloped. The dialogue-heavy ending prioritizes cryptic tone over emotional stakes. Fails to fully "show" the urgency of cultural erasure beyond explicit statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination of indigenous preservation and retro-futurism avoids cliché, but phrases like "guardian of the hearth" lean generic. Some sensory details (e.g., "coffee without asking") feel perfunctory. The trapper's internal logic remains overly rational with little emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Gels all elements without prioritizing depth. The retro-futuristic setting and cultural conflict are inventive, yet the story leans on implied themes rather than embedding them in concrete scenes. Lingering questions about the blueprint’s origin suggest ambition but lack payoff.</comment>
