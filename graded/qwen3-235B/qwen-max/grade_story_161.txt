<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's revenge motive is clear but somewhat one-dimensional; sardonic tone inconsistently applied. Antique seal ties to plot but underdevelops personal connection. Motivation drives action but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable investigative beats; peacock tail as analytical method lacks logical explanation. Storytelling constrained by word limit—some jumps in discovery, uneven pacing. Ending connects to opening but feels overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting blends industrial sterility (fluorescent lights, blueprints) with symbolic peacock imagery. Atmosphere supports conspiratorial mood but paper airplane facility’s relevance feels arbitrary. Sensory details present but not fully immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (peacock-tail analysis, triumphant peacocks) suggest thematic depth. Dialogue with engineer adds human dimension but feels rushed. Ending evokes satisfaction but lacks lingering emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on revenge/corporate-greed tropes; method of peacock-pattern analysis feels underexplained. Some fresh imagery (tails as banners) but overall plot follows predictable template. Dialogue occasionally stilted; tone avoids clichés but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements (seal, conspiracy) are cohesive but not all integral. Story uses brief length competently but not innovatively. Leaves thematic questions but lacks unique emotional resonance. Some forced integrations (peacock tail, paper airplane facility).</comment>
