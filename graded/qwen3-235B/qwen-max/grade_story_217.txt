<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation to prime stagnant heart is clear, but "underestimated rebel" trait lacks sufficient behavioral evidence. Emotional reactions to cuisine feel undermotivated, and cryptic dialogue in final scene undermines distinct voice. Personality influences knife's symbolic use but not proactive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure uneven: haunting call drives initial momentum, but meal scene drags without escalating tension. Abrupt spatial/temporal shift at ending disrupts coherence. Emotional arc exists (stagnantâ†’lighter) but lacks intermediate benchmarks. Pacing misbalances between atmospheric setup and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ephemeral gloom tone inconsistently maintained - spice aromas and nostalgic cuisine memories jar against decayed setting. Sensory details present but unbalanced (overemphasized taste/smell vs. underdeveloped tactile elements). Haunted house as metaphor operates superficially rather than thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery (faded park, distorted mirrors) but lacks substantial subtext about adaptation vs. living. Central conflict (emotional stasis vs. engagement) resolved too conveniently. Dialogic exchange feels heavy-handed rather than thematically nuanced. Writing shows technical competence but limited stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Predictable haunted location trope paired with mysterious mentor figure. Kitchen nostalgia device feels mechanically inserted rather than organically developed. Overreliance on melancholic descriptors ("faded," "cracked," "gloomy"). Cryptic dialogue risks pretension without sufficient payoff. Emotional shifts stated more than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Most elements present but unevenly integrated - cuisine/haunted house relationship strains credibility. Style prioritizes mood over depth, with concision feeling more imposed than purposeful. Ambiguous ending invites reflection but lacks narrative anchoring. Offers mild emotional resonance without substantial thematic excavation.</comment>
