<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conflicting depth; the sock ties motivation to character effectively, but the philosophical duel lacks nuance. Mechanical arm feels underexploited, and the shadow opponent has no personality. Motivation is clear but oversimplified through trauma rather than layered reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum is undercut by abrupt shifts (e.g., "cryptic note scrawled on the wall") and lack of stakes in the intellectual duel. The sock-to-key revelation drives resolution, but pacing feels compressed rather than cohesive. The ending lacks payoff due to insufficient groundwork for emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storm and lighthouse create a moody backdrop, but sensory details ("tangibly abstract hum", "coded desperation") veer into abstraction over immersion. Atmosphere suits despair but disconnects from character psychology at critical moments. The sock and key are meaningfully connected to setting, but "coded desperation" remains vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mix of evocative imagery (storm reflections, rust/salt) and contrived symbolism (sock as "dreams deconstructed"). End revelation is cliché yet intriguing, with dialogue and emotional beats feeling stilted. Theme of self-deconstruction emerges but isn't fully interrogated within constraints. Subtext about grief resonates unevenly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some AI-like phrasing ("whispering secrets to the wind") and clichéd elements (abandoned lighthouse's chest, twin tragedies) undermine originality. Mechanical arm and mind-storm parallels show ingenuity, but emotional beats are stated more than shown. Tropes subverted only superficially, with thematic weight battling against ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are mostly functional rather than essential; the lighthouse and sock anchor cohesion, but the philosophical duel and "tangibly abstract" feel forced. Story leans on gothic templates rather than transcending them. The bittersweet revelation is undercut by underdeveloped stakes and character interiority.</comment>
