<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's lukewarm trait underexploited; motivation is clear but lacks psychological nuance. Actions align with stated goals but insufficiently reveal inner conflict. Distinct voice absent in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot arcs from uncertainty to symbolic resolution, but pacing feels compressed. Assigned elements drive progression, yet character transformation occurs abruptly. Logical cause/effect but constrained resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of isolation and ethereal tension is evocative, but sensory details remain uneven. Lunar base lacks immersive integration (e.g., stage fog incongruous). Doormat and metal contrast effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (metaphors for resilience/fear) deepen themes. Emotional impact stems from symbolic quilt and confrontation with self. Central conflict resolved purposefully, though ending slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting and phantom tropes feel semi-familiar. Overdescriptive passages weaken clarity. Phantoms as plot device verge on clich√©, but the mage's self-reflection adds marginal originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Achieves thematic cohesion through symbolic objects, though lunar base and timeframe feel superficially utilized. Style occasionally distracts but leaves lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
