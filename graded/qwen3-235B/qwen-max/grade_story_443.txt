<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's emotional arc is present but relies on archetypal symbolism; reaper element underdeveloped, motivation lacks psychological complexity despite resonant imagery and transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within constraints; progression from library entry to spring revelation is logical, though transitions between atmospheric shifts feel slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory layering (stone echoes, shimmering titles, hum of seeds) creates immersive liminality; setting actively mirrors emotional states rather than merely decorating them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor-driven prose avoids clich√© through specific imagery (ink bleeding into new stories); theme of emotional regeneration emerges organically rather than didactically, elevated by elegant show-don't-tell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity in object/setting connections, but bird/seed device borders on deus ex machina; some poetic phrasing risks veering into self-indulgence without destabilizing the whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exemplifies 'economy of meaning' in constrained form; elements function symbiotically rather than as checklist, though deeper excavation of reaper-specific existential conflict could elevate impact.</comment>
