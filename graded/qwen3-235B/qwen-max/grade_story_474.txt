<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak character voices; motivations (especially Leo's) feel underexplored; the chessboard's symbolic resonance with their shared pain is underdeveloped despite promising setup</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Disjointed structure from abrupt introduction of cooking class elements; climactic resolution feels rushed despite atmospheric groundwork; cause-effect between rebellion and their escape lacks narrative payoff</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Struggles to synthesize assigned elements cohesively; some compelling imagery but lacks editorial rigor in integrating cooking class with celestial themes</comment>
