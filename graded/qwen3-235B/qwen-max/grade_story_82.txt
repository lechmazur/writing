<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has some depth but motivations feel surface-level; reluctant caretaker role lacks internal conflict, "analytically playful" trait inconsistently manifested through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression works within constraints but pivotal revelations feel rushed; journal exposition creates abrupt tonal shift; resolution ties to setup but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually vivid but internally inconsistent (futuristic hub vs. decaying orchard); sensory details enhance mood but setting elements don't fully harmonize thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (dragon tooth/orchard as mourning entity) elevates theme, but emotional resonance is diluted by exposition; imagery is strong but lacks distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Blends fantasy tropes with speculative elements but doesn't subvert expectations; some fresh metaphors ("graveyard of twisted trees") undercut by generic phrases like "gleeful sorrow."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive execution of assigned elements but lacks transcendent quality; story functions as is but requires polish for prestige publication; thematic ambition exceeds full realized impact.</comment>
