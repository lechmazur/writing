<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Edith's motivation is clear but her emotional depth remains superficial; the stuffed toy ear is symbolic but underutilized as a narrative device beyond thematic signposting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with a clear arc, though pacing stumbles between exposition and action; cause/effect between visions and consequences feels logical but rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere excel—“amber prison” and sensory details (stew, steam, frayed fabric) create vivid, oppressive mood—though thematic connections to the timeframe could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (unraveling bulletins mirroring Edith’s decline) elevates the story; tension between truth and sacrifice prompts reflection, but emotional payoff lacks full resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (steam as prophecy) and layered themes; rare moments of overly ornate prose (“amber prison”) slightly dilute authenticity but do not overwhelm the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements, though some (e.g., the toy ear) feel secondary to plot momentum; the abbreviated format sacrifices deeper exploration of Edith’s transformation.</comment>
