<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth; personality expressed through actions and dialogue doesn't fully cohere or reveal complexity. Voice feels generic despite first-person elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but lacks tension or stakes. Narrative arc constrained to decision-making, with limited progression from beginning to resolution despite cohesive structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting details create vivid atmosphere. Spiritual secularity and decaying spaceport evoke mood effectively, though emotional connection to environment remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance diluted by abstract phrasing. Strong metaphors (coat button, coffee stains) and theme of preservation emerge, but ending feels overly neat rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original concepts diluted by familiar tropes in tone and execution. Sensory details avoid generic descriptors but some metaphors border on overused rather than strikingly unique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate technically but lack transformative synergy. Writing demonstrates competence rather than mastery; voice and pacing show individuality but not distinction. Ends before emotional payoff develops fully.</comment>
