<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character displays clear motivation (salvaging culture) and undergoes subtle change (accepting impermanence), but "peculiarly functional" hands remain underexplored, and emotional depth feels slightly abstracted by stylized prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic juggling and tea leaf interpretation toward a coherent resolution, though the abrupt orb slip/failure feels contrived within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The void as failing memory is evocatively rendered through sensory details like smudged ink and humming air, creating atmospheric cohesion between concept and environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elegiac tone and metaphor-laden prose create strong emotional resonance; subtext about cultural preservation's fluidity emerges organically through imagery like the star-rooted tree orb.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© despite stylized language; metaphors verge on overextension (tea leaves revealing "fragments") but mostly feel fresh, trading occasional floridity for conceptual boldness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity (voids, salvaging) with intentional brevity; the ending's philosophical shift feels earned rather than imposed as a mechanical conclusion.</comment>
