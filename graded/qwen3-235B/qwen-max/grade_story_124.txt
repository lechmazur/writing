<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks deeper exploration of the drifter’s past or inner conflicts; motivation feels abstract rather than grounded in tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end but relies heavily on poetic abstraction to mask underdeveloped cause-effect dynamics and a rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts (sterile command center vs. earthy memories); atmospheric coherence but insufficient tactile/sensory detail to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (threads, weaving) and emotional undercurrents, though thematic ambition occasionally outpaces narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Relies on overfamiliar metaphors (dancing to “create grace”) and poetic vagueness; blends AI-style ornateness with inconsistent emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesive but overly reliant on poetic abstraction to unify elements; themes lack the penetrating depth needed for elite publishability.</comment>
