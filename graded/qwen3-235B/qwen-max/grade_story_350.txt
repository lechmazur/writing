<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations remain abstract and unexplored. No discernible 'voice' or personal stakes despite atmospheric setup. Actions only superficially connect to puppeteering skills.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks tension. Action progression feels mechanical, not emotionally earned. Connection between opening and revelation is tenuous. Pacing uneven with abrupt conceptual leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Evocative details compete with incongruous elements. Setting's grandeur contrasts poorly with mundane stamp album. Sensory richness exists but lacks thematic integration. Greek temple's significance remains unexplained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occasional poetic language undermined by vague symbolism. "Symphonies" concept lacks concrete manifestation. Ending fails to resolve emotional threads. Writing style occasionally veers toward empty lyricism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mix of fresh imagery (tears as truth-bearers) and literary clich√©s ("whispers of history"). Avoids formulaic transitions but relies on conventional mystical archaeology tropes. Emotional resonance remains surface-level despite show-don't-tell efforts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Story remains competent but forgettable. Elements combined with minimal synergy. Shortness feels restrictive rather than purposeful. Central themes lack revelatory power despite ambitious setup.</comment>
