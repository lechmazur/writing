<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's symbolic despair and quiet resolve are compelling, but depth undermined by abstract internalization lacking concrete motivations or layered contradictions; psychological complexity sacrificed for poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent arc pivoting on watch-band revelation works within constraints, but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect connection between photographs and boundary themes insufficiently dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details like "artificial constellations" and "windows glowing like stars trapped in amber" create hauntingly immersive cyberpunk-romantic atmosphere that thematically enhances existential themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose and spatial-temporal layering offer intellectual rewards, but emotional engagement limited by detached narration; ending's purposeful smile lacks earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but contains slightly overwritten descriptors ("subjectively rational") and potentially AI-esque phrasing ("garden secrets whispered through vents"); conceptual uniqueness slightly diluted by ornamental prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements combined inventively with thematic resonance, but cohesive force weakened by underdeveloped emotional stakes; economy of form occasionally feels restrictive rather than intentional.</comment>
