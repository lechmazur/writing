<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's repressed nature and terror are described but not deeply embodied; motivations for cosmic verse stem from vague yearning rather than individualized psychology</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression through perfume bottle's hum and stone pedestal feels inevitable but lacks narrative tension; ending's thematic ambiguity weakens structural resolution</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, sensory-rich setting of nature-reclaimed city creates immersive atmosphere; physical details organically mirror character's psychological state</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "ink spilled across parchment") resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract diction; theme of divine creation vs. self-destruction only partially realized</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains borderline purple prose ("whispered warnings of hubris"); surreal elements grounded in specific imagery, though some phrasing verges on ornateness</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but could emphasize thematic interplay more; brevity works against emotional payoff, leaving questions about character's fate unresolved</comment>
