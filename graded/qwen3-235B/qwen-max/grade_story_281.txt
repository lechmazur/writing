<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to challenge the status quo is clear but superficial, relying on clichéd redemption tropes. His relationship to the dummy reveals his internal conflict but lacks nuanced exploration of his past or deeper motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels rushed in key moments (e.g., sudden transformation). Impromptu poetry as a method lacks narrative weight, and the resolution leans on thematic statement over earned emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses effective sensory details (cold wood, groaning engines) but the "haunted lighthouse engine room" relies on generic spooky tropes. The storm/timeframe setup feels loosely integrated and underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance through visceral metaphors (shedding old skin) and themes of self-reinvention. Dialogue with the dummy is conceptually purposeful but occasionally stilted, undermining its symbolic weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some AI-like phrasing ("burning like scorching poise") and reliance on familiar arcs (supernatural guide redeems thief). The dummy's cryptic wisdom feels derivative, though the poetic resolution offers modest innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements like the dummy and lighthouse are cohesive, but "between appointments" and poetry method feel tacked on. Story’s brevity sacrifices depth but retains haunting imagery and thematic clarity on transformation.</comment>
