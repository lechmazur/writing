<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters have some nuance but underdeveloped arcs. Callan's "cynically hopeful" trait isn't fully interrogated, while Lira's motivations remain opaque despite key plot revelations. Dialogue attempts subtext but lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uneven pacing undermines structure. The inciting action (scattering herbs) lacks narrative weight due to rushed setup. Sudden time jumps (e.g., speed dating reference) and unresolved stakes create cohesion issues within tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (charred wood, ash-gray clouds) effectively create mood, but genre hybridization (medieval setting vs. drone tech) introduces tonal dissonance. The orchard's impending destruction provides limited atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (herbs as hope) is conceptually interesting but superficially executed. Dialogue lacks authentic rhythm, particularly in exposition-heavy scenes. Theme of mercy remains uninterrogated despite narrative framing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Blending sci-fi and fantasy elements feels derivative rather than subversive. Some original imagery undercut by abrupt tonal shifts (e.g., speed dating reveal). Emotional arcs feel telegraphed through dialogue rather than organic character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overambition compromises cohesion. Many assigned elements feel arbitrarily assembled rather than purposefully integrated. Promising thematic nucleus about despair/resistance lacks sufficient narrative exploration.</comment>
