<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are present but inconsistent; stage fright manifests uniquely but isn't tightly interwoven with actions. Motivations feel abstract despite distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels rushed; key turning motif weakens cause-effect logic. Pacing struggles within word limits, reducing narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orbital debris setting vividly rendered with sensory details (smell of earth, static whispers). "Defiant hush" tone is atmospherically consistent but not deeply thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of identity/hope present but superficially resolved. Literary devices (irony of toy-making) work, but ending lacks emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original setup (space exorcism) subverts genre but relies on clich√©d phrases ("whispered stories") and overwrought metaphors. Emotional nuance exists but borders on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative elements coexist but lack cohesion. Premise exceeds word limit's demands; thematic depth sacrificed for brevity. Lingering question of "lies" remains underexplored.</comment>
