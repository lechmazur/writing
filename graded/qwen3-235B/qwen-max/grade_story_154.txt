<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but shallowly sketched; motivation to track social changes feels underdeveloped compared to mystical plot elements. Physical frailty is shown but emotional complexity remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Meandering structure lacks clear conflict/resolution arc; levitation climax introduces mysticism without fully connecting to social change theme. Pacing balances atmospheric detail with forward momentum but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory details about bonfires and stone walls create mood, but setting feels like a generic touristified village without unique cultural specificity that would deepen thematic connections to cultural erosion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occasional vivid metaphors ("jubilant despair") but lacks narrative urgency or emotional resonance. The central theme of cultural memory gets overshadowed by mystical elements introduced late. Ending suspends rather than satisfies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy tropes (magical relic, bardic lore) without subverting conventions. Uneven stylistic register - attempts poetic description but includes awkward phrases like "jubilant despair" without earning their emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. Certain components (timeframe "between games") remain underutilized. Ambiguous ending risks feeling incomplete rather than purposeful.</comment>
