<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is shown but motivation to "quell an uprising within" feels vague and inconsistently tied to his actions; trauma is mentioned but not deeply explored through his behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; the jiggling action and sand mandala method lack clear cause-effect progression, and the story ends with unresolved tension despite the word limit, weakening plot closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (quartz ceiling, sand mandala) evoke a haunting atmosphere, though the cardboard tube’s ordinariness feels tonally dissonant, slightly undercutting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical imagery and symbolism (mandala as a conduit for hidden truths) add depth, but the ending’s emotional surge feels abrupt rather than earned, diluting storytelling impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing ("restless spirits"); the cardboard tube’s juxtaposition with mystical elements offers originality but lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements like the mandala and stargazing contribute to mood, but the story’s lack of resolution and underdeveloped themes prevent it from feeling purposeful or cohesive in its brevity.</comment>
