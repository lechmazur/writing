<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character’s internal conflict over perfection is clear, but her reactions and development feel somewhat abstract and underexplored. Her motivation to study tides is consistent but lacks visceral emotional grounding. The method of tracking the goose offers symbolic resonance but doesn’t deeply reveal her personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has a loose arc (obsession → realization → partial closure), but the pacing drags in sections and key transitions (e.g., goose’s significance) feel abrupt. The method and concept shape the narrative but lack tight cause-and-effect. The ending resolves little, leaving a sense of incompleteness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative through sensory details (crashing waves, iron scent), and the glass observatory contrasts thematically with the forge relic. However, the “napping hours” timeframe is underutilized, and the setting’s potential for isolation and introspection is only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of perfection’s cost is clear but handled predictably. Metaphors (goose vs. sapped vitality) are competent but not strikingly original. The ending hints at self-awareness without emotional resonance, and subtext about loss of creativity feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on overwritten (e.g., “weight of perfection she had chased for years”), and the goose as a symbolic device feels tropish. Sensory details are specific but not uniquely vivid. The internal conflict is humanlike but lacks idiosyncratic nuance, and the tone occasionally drifts between melancholic and abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements, but some (napping hours, fervent indifference) feel tacked on. The style is polished but not distinctive, and the short form emphasizes brevity over depth. The theme lingers faintly but lacks the punch to feel transcendent.</comment>
