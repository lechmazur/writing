<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity; the silent vow is intriguing but underexplored. Actions like tightening grip on trident are surface-level indications of resolve without deeper internal conflict. Motivation stated but not dramatized through meaningful choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motion toward pedestal creates minimal arc, but structural integrity compromised by vague cause-effect transitions (e.g., sudden clock chime synchronicity). Pacing alternates between lush description and abrupt revelations; cosmic alignment conclusion feels rushed given limited character groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensorium of zero-g hall with refracted light and humming energy creates immersive liminality. However, atmospheric elements (crystalline chandeliers, spectral dancers) occasionally overwhelm narrative function, existing more as poetic tableau than thematic engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose ("rainbows danced like ghosts") impresses, but emotional impact diluted by abstract final revelation that feels like thematic shorthand rather than earned epiphany. Concept of collective vow lacks human-scale specificity to sustain weighty ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding shows inventive blending of knightly tradition and cosmic weirdness, avoiding most fantasy clich√©s. Some purple prose tendencies ("forgotten oceans" phrasing) and uneven tension between sacred disorder theme and orderly plot progression toward cosmic harmony.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive dreamscape, but thematic ambition exceeds emotional delivery. Brief format works for visual spectacle but strains philosophical payoff. Lingering impression stems more from imagery than narrative profundity.</comment>
