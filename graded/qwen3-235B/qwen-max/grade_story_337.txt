<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; internal conflicts feel underexplored despite consistent action alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence is generally strong, though the oracle’s abstract guidance feels abrupt; pacing mostly efficient but slightly rushed in resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Evocative details (e.g., candlelight, mirror pool) establish mood, but setting specificity falters—kaleidoscope motif isn’t fully integrated into narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of tradition and self-discovery resonate, bolstered by symbols like the cracked vessel; emotional impact is undercut by occasionally generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés, but oracle encounters and "fragmented map" trope lean formulaic; language remains clear without excessive ornamentation or AI-like repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively utilized, but the story’s brevity limits thematic penetration; the ending feels slightly pat rather than resonantly ambiguous.</comment>
