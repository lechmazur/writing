<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits and voice, but motivations remain atmospheric hints rather than fully realized psychology. The "warmly aloof" attribute shapes behavior but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mysterious momentum carries through concise arc, but the vanishing feels abrupt rather than climactic. Cloud-path method introduces intriguing logic yet remains under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative fragments of setting exist (cargo hold, starry void), but space pirate context feels arbitrarily chosen rather than integral. Sensory details like ozone scent are effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language (time as slippery smoke, shadows as stabilizing ritual) elevates the narrative. The ending's shift to time-as-expansion concept offers a haunting payoff, though emotional stakes remain diffuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally leans on "scent of ozone" trope. Prose style balances lyricism with restraint, though cosmic time-void resolution feels like a convenient escape from narrative resolution rather than earned thematic conclusion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists despite tight constraints, but the brevity sacrifices full exploration of paradoxical time themes. Leaves questions rather than revelations about human connection in cosmic scales.</comment>
