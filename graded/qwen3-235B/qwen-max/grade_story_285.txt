<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's hesitancy and awkwardness are stated but underdeveloped through actions; motivation to restore traditions exists but lacks tangible stakes; reliance on abstract descriptors dilutes emotional impact</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels rushed; key elements (elders' evidence, bridge mechanics) remain underexplained; pacing uneven but not fatally flawed within constraints</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of hermit crab behavior adds depth; theme of adaptation vs. tradition emerges clearly; underdeveloped emotional arc prevents higher score</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in premise but relies on overly poetic language; characterization leans on familiar reluctant hero tropes without fresh subversion</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; forced parallels between shell-changing and world-bridging; brevity obscures thematic complexity rather than enhancing it</comment>
