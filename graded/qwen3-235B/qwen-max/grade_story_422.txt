<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elise’s selective muteness and ventriloquism shape her observational role but aren’t deeply interrogated; her weather-archiving motivation is intriguing but underdeveloped. The coffee sleeve’s symbolic weight is clear, but her emotional complexity remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on overheard calls and a chance meeting, but the progression from introspection to connection feels rushed. The arc between her isolation and the man’s appearance lacks psychological or emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diner’s hum, wind, and cardboard sleeve evoke tactile intimacy, but the parallel universe beach fades as a half-realized metaphor. The wind functions as a narrative device but strains the atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong poetic imagery (storm-mapping as human clarity) and subtext about silent empathy elevate the story. The ending resonates thematically but risks sentimentality. Subtler tension within Elise’s muteness could deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>No overt clichés; the premise is original but occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction (e.g., “euphoric agitation”). Elise’s muteness isn’t fully exploited as a narrative constraint, and the dummy’s role feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain against the word limit. The muted voice and wind-driven plot feel purposeful, but the parallel universe and archival motivation are underexplored. Lingering emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>
