<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are consistent and integral to plot, but depth of transformation feels slightly rushed despite functional arc; voice is present but lacks deeper idiosyncrasies.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear arc, but the connection between two fateful letters remains underdeveloped, slightly weakening cause-effect logic within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through fog and moonlight, though environmental details occasionally border on generic noirish tropes rather than achieving total uniqueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Puzzle-as-metaphor works effectively with emotional resolution, though the ending’s symbolic resonance leans slightly on familiar "letting go" themes without radical subtextual innovation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with fresh symbolic integration (e.g., puzzle as self-reflection), but some phrases like "radiant light" verge on abstraction without fully visceral imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Cohesion exists but feels pressed by length constraints—elements serve theme but lack interplay complexity required for prestigious publication tiers; thematic depth is functional, not transcendent.</comment>
