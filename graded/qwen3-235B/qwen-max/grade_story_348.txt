<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character's sleepwalking trait contradicts her precise movements; motivations hinted at but not deeply explored through actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a static "discover artifacts" structure with no tension; pilgrimage framing lacks narrative payoff; transitions are smooth but hollow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (mildew, rustling leaves) create mood, but symbolic elements like lightning bugs feel thematic rather than atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Uses clich√©d metaphors (e.g., "bridge between worlds"); ending loops but offers no emotional or thematic climax; decent imagery but thin resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on overused tropes (ancient labs, spirit guardians); some fresh connections (bottled insects as spiritual guides) but undermined by overly ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than interlocking; feels like a mood piece stretched thin, lacking narrative necessity or urgency.</comment>
