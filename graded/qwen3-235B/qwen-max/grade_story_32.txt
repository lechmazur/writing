<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or internal conflict; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; reactions to objects feel arbitrary rather than psychically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by vague mystical revelations rather than logical action; cause-effect between melodies, building, and escape remains unearned; abrupt resolution undermines coherence within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich visual and auditory textures establish haunting atmosphere, but setting's connection to simulation concept feels tacked-on; decayed objects resonate more with surface aesthetics than deeper thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (coins as memory carriers, shifting architecture) contrast with excessive abstraction; ending's vague "hope" lacks emotional pay-off; thematic tension between creation/illusion remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on overused simulation tropes; phrases like "weight of remembering" verge on clich√©; inconsistent sensory detail (shifting buildings lack physical logic); atmospheric flourishes outweigh narrative innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements crammed into story without organic integration; forced mysticism undermines premise's potential; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; lingering impact diminished by resolution's vagueness.</comment>
