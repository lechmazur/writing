<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but feels underexplored beyond surface-level internal conflict. Lacks nuanced reactions to objects and minimal distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing falters at climax, with rushed resolution. Concept ties to plot but fails to fully exploit the emotional weight of "impossible choices." Cause-effect logic mostly solid but relies on abrupt revelations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (storm, mirrors) immerse readers. Atmosphere aligns with theme, though some setting elements (e.g., reef's significance) remain underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong imagery/symbolism (mirrors, relics) and a resonant ending. Subtext about memory/sacrifice is hinted at but lacks layered exploration. Writing style enhances mood but occasionally verges on archaic stiffness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending fantasy with psychological themes. Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar "haunted hero" tropes. Language occasionally overwrought ("grudgingly sweet"), though emotional beats feel purposeful, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative synergy. Style occasionally hinders clarity, yet the tight length serves the narrative's urgency. Themes linger, but the story's potential depth feels restrained by word count.</comment>
