<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eira's motivation to archive emotional patterns is clear and consistent, though secondary characters lack depth; their reactions reveal traits but feel somewhat formulaic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but remains episodic; interactions with patrons form a loose arc, but the constrained word count limits deeper structural complexity or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (flickering firelight, clinking goblets, carved beams) immerse readers, though the "overlooked era" timeframe is underdeveloped and vaguely referenced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., wine as unspoken truths) and lyrical prose add depth, but dialogue occasionally leans on archetypal mystic phrasing, slightly diluting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some originality in concept (emotional archives) and specific imagery (pulsing parchment), but the Viking longhouse and "unspoken offer" border on atmospheric clichés without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story is cohesive but uneven—elegantly written moments coexist with underexplored elements; its brevity serves the vignette format but limits thematic expansiveness.</comment>
