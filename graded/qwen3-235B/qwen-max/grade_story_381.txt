<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Necromancer aspect is underdeveloped; motivation for preservation exists but isn't meaningfully connected to his role as a necromancer. Emotional depth remains surface-level despite movie quote references.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Linear progression lacks narrative tension; mapping mission feels more like a static checklist than a dramatically engaging arc. Transitions between actions are functional but underwhelming within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich visual details about crystals and light create atmosphere, but the necromancer's magic system and the "futuristic nostalgia" tone lack concrete integration with setting elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (light as film, tech vs nature) work but lack originality. Ending achieves quiet poignancy, though emotional impact is diminished by underdeveloped central conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Formulaic elements (melancholic preservationist, "scarce abundance" abstraction) overshadow originality. Necromancer/technology hybrid concept feels generic rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Story holds together technically but lacks thematic depth or stylistic daring required for prestigious publication. Core elements could be rearranged without significant narrative impact.</comment>
