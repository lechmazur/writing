<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are thinly sketched; the exorcist's guarded nature and coy aggression lack psychological depth. Dr. Voss's role feels schematic, with minimal agency beyond exposition. Interactions lack complexity, relying on genre tropes rather than authentic emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Puzzles propel the plot effectively through interconnected spaces, but the ending's thematic pivot feels abrupt. Cause-effect between riddles and discoveries is logical yet strained by tight pacing. The dance hall's symbolic function remains underexplored despite its atmospheric potential.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich visuals (whispering postcards, meteor-streaked skies) establish mood but lack tactile specificity - sounds, textures, smells are underutilized. The psychic research facility's anachronistic blend of science/wonder risks feeling decorative rather than organically threatening.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (postcards, shifting symbols) works narratively but lacks lyrical resonance. Dialogue is functional yet clichéd ("wonder is worth the risk"). The ending's theme emerges clearly but lacks the ambiguity or emotional weight to truly provoke reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contains genre conventions (hidden rooms, psychic research) without meaningful subversion. Descriptive phrases ("swirling dancers," "undoubtedly sinister") occasionally drift toward cliché. The exorcist's profession feels underexploited as a narrative lens.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't fully integrated - dance lessons serve little purpose beyond atmosphere. Some imaginative flourishes (postcard as key) elevate the plot, but overall feels constrained by checklist-like construction rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
