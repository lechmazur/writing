<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation feels imposed rather than earned through actions or reactions. Calm demeanor isn't sufficiently tied to personality beyond surface-level contrast with urgency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under its ambition; decoding the keys concludes abruptly without earned resolution. Pacing loses logical flow as cause-effect relationships between keys and universe-saving remain unexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid visual atmosphere (holographic equations, decaying center) creates immersive mood, but sparse sensory details beyond sight weaken full immersion in the "fractured grace" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("equations like dying stars") hint at deeper themes, but emotional impact is diluted by underdeveloped stakes. Ending's haunting melody lacks weight without prior buildup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Blends unique concepts (probability timelines, artifacts of lost potential) with familiar tropes (doomsday prophecies, lone savant). Prose avoids overt clich√©s but leans on grandiose assertions instead of earned originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</comment>Story's ambition exceeds its execution; elements feel serviceable but not seamless. While concise, lacks a resonant thematic core to justify brevity beyond surface-level mystery.</comment>
