<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (decoding inscriptions) is clear but underdeveloped; her identity as a physician isn’t meaningfully integrated into her actions or voice, weakening the “quietly dramatic” trait’s impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The scramble to decode the cutlass creates urgency, but the plot lacks a complete arc—resolution feels abrupt, with cause/effect relationships (e.g., how coffee grounds inform the breakthrough) insufficiently explained within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (generators, rustling palms, corroded blade) immerse readers, but the digital nomad camp’s connection to the core mystery feels superficial; the juxtaposition of tech and ancient artifacts could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery (“constellations forming in a chaotic sky”) is evocative, and the blend of ancient/modern themes adds complexity, but emotional resonance is diluted by exposition-heavy introspection and a weakly executed “hope” ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Freshens tropes by merging archaeology with digital nomadism; avoids clichéd “treasure hunt” clichés. Some overwrought phrases (“dire enchantment”) flirt with purple prose, but most sensory details feel original and purposefully deployed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding elevates the premise, but the story’s brevity undermines narrative cohesion; elements like the coffee grounds feel forced, and the blend of assigned components lacks seamless integration.</comment>
