<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "trickster" identity and language preservation motivation lack deep integration; reactions to gift tag and dare only partially reveal psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed; the dare-driven action satisfies structural coherence while leaving emotional and thematic payoffs underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in biodome setting strengthens atmosphere; "ghostly resolve" tone is consistently achieved through environmental details rather than character interiority.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative employs effective symbolism (forked paths, archaic device) and maintains tension; theme of self-confrontation feels somewhat superficial despite evocative execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique combination of eco-fiction and linguistic anthropology; some character psychology feels streamlined rather than deeply nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates most elements though certain connections (language work/rivalry) remain underexplored; strong atmospheric impact compensates for some narrative brevity.</comment>
