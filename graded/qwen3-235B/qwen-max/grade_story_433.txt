<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like hardheadedness and being broken are stated more than demonstrated; motivations feel generic. Lack of internal depth undermines believability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc, but transitions between gallery and mountain journey feel rushed. The central action (deciphering prophecy) lacks narrative weight due to underexplored stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (cold vs. warmth, melting snow) effectively contrast moods. The ephemeral gallery's thematic link to fleeting resolve is underdeveloped but atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("whispers of prophecy") and symbolic motifs (storm vs. hope) are undercut by predictable emotional beats and a lack of original insight into the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on trope-laden elements (secret tomes, broken travelers). Overwrought adjectives ("pristine snow," "unguilty spirit") and a lack of subtext diminish originality and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels superficial; elements are stapled together rather than organically integrated. Style occasionally elevates the narrative but often hinders depth.</comment>
