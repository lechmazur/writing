<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits like obsession and dedication are stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; motivation for reconciliation feels abstract and lacks emotional grounding; the brass key's transformation isn't tightly tied to character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has setup and resolution but lacks middle development; the key's activation feels abrupt, with unclear causal links between diary rewriting and supernatural consequences; pacing uneven due to underdeveloped cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details (pen scratching, key warmth), but setting significance (whisper collection point) isn't fully integrated into narrative logic; noble chaos tone is hinted but inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Themes of reconciliation are present but underexplored; relies on "telling" emotional states; key/ghosts symbolism and crosswords-as-metaphor lack depth; ending lacks emotional payoff despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar haunted-archive tropes; some originality in combining crosswords with historical revision, but execution feels derivative; atmospheric description is vivid but occasionally veers into purple prose ("noble chaos").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements exist but strain cohesion (e.g., crossword creator title unused); brevity sacrifices depth; setup-to-climax logic gaps; style occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity but maintains baseline readability.</comment>
