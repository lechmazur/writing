<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's traits are shown through symbolic actions, but internal transformation lacks depth beyond established trauma tropes. Motivation is clear but insufficiently nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent yet compressed, with rushed transitions between key moments. Logical flow is maintained but feels constrained by word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid imagery establishes setting, but the castle’s symbolic connection to the character’s psyche remains underdeveloped. Atmosphere supports tone but not thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive object use (spectacles, key), though the misplaced letter borders on contrived. Language occasionally veers toward ornate phrasing without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates emotional resonance and thematic clarity. Minor inconsistencies in pacing and symbolism prevent full mastery.</comment>
