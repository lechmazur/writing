<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to unraveling sorrow are clear, but emotional depth could be sharper; the plush effectively bridges past/present but inner conflict remains somewhat surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure shows a clear arc within the word limit, but transitions between dreams feel abrupt; emotional stakes are present but pacing occasionally falters in balancing action and reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with xenon lighting and fragmented memories, but the tunnel setting doesn’t evolve beyond a transitional space; sensory details evoke mood but lack functional integration with the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through specific imagery (e.g., hand passing through child), but the theme of resilience risks oversimplification; symbolism of the plush and tapestry is strong, though subtext remains uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés in its use of time travel/dream sequences, but emotional beats occasionally rely on familiar tropes (e.g., solitary tear, approval from stranger); language is purposeful but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Overall cohesive but strained by ambitious scope; some elements (e.g., dream-hopping) feel tacked on rather than essential. The ending achieves thematic resonance but leaves narrative gaps, suggesting untapped potential.</comment>
