<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's aloofness is established but could use more nuanced interaction with the world. Father's letters drive her, though internal depth feels selectively surfaced rather than deeply excavated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegantly compressed arc in tight space; rhythm falters slightly during emotional transitions. Mapping-as-movement and compass-as-symbol provide structural spine, but resolution feels slightly anticipated rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral synesthetic details create immersive dissonance between past revelry and present desolation. Color-emotion mapping risks occasional schematicism, but overall atmosphere works as collaborator in the protagonist's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (compass, colors, deflation) carries thematic heft. Ending transcends solipsism by linking personal catharsis to generational haunting. Subtle showing of emotional release through environmental transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Some phrases ("whispers of forgotten revelry") border on stock expressions, but bold choices like "laughter and music...hollow yet heavy" elevate. Avoids purple prose through precise, unexpected descriptors ("colors dripped like melting wax").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements interwoven with purpose; brevity amplifies haunting quality. Lingering question about whether "mapping" function could have been more physically dramatized rather than metaphorized.</comment>
