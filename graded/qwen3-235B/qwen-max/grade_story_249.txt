<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation clear but 'lazily ambitious' lacks nuance. Actions align with creed, but character voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherent but feels rushed; ending lacks emotional payoff despite logical progression within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere immersive, blending decay and whimsy. Sensory details vividly anchor the world's melancholic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses symbolism effectively (marble as resilience) but subtext feels surface-level; ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original concept elevated by fresh metaphors, but occasional ornate phrasing strains plausibility (e.g., "harmonies floating like ghosts").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive yet occasionally forced (barbershop quartet method, underexplored 'lazily ambitious' trait). Ambitious in theme but unevenly executed.</comment>
