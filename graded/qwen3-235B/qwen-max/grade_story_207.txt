<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's "meekly assertive" trait lacks concrete behavioral evidence beyond vague determination. Motivation (oath-breaking guilt) is emotionally resonant but thinly developed. Flower placement and data-sifting show procedural steps, but interiority remains abstract, veiling deeper psychological nuance beneath poetic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mirrored structure of dividing physical flowers vs. digital truths provides nominal cohesion, but pacing lags in verbose atmospheric descriptions. The "arc" from guilt to tentative redemption exists primarily through implication rather than causally linked developments within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rusted medical bay details (clicking boots, cracked viewports) succeed viscerally, but cosmic "secret song" metaphors border on cliché. Sensory specifics anchor the setting, though its abandonment feels static rather than dynamically interacting with the character's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (faded flowers as memory anchors) and subtextual guilt/redemption themes work effectively. Emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition; "showing" occurs intermittently through deliberate gestures, but over-reliance on abstract phrases like "joyful loneliness" dampens visceral resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids typical space opera tropes through melancholic introspection rather than action. Some metaphors ("secret song") falter, but the fusion of galactic scale with intimate trauma feels original. Emotional shading transcends simple "sad AI weeping" clichés through restrained delivery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion strained by element-checklist execution—gossip columns and "divide" action connect mechanically rather than organically. Style achieves lyrical moments, but compression feels enforced by constraints rather than artistically deliberate. Lingering thematic questions about guilt outweigh plot-specific curiosity.</comment>
