<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivation is implied but not fully realized through action or nuance, making emotional engagement difficult.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed and underdeveloped; pivotal moments lack buildup, and resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative details (moonlight, glowing shell) but inconsistent integration with character stakes or plot logic, weakening immersion and thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphors are occasionally striking but often generic; dialogue is sparse and unmemorable, and narrative momentum is undercut by predictable tropes and underdeveloped ideas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Story coherently incorporates assigned elements but often superficially; structure feels dictated by constraints rather than organic development, limiting emotional or conceptual impact.</comment>
