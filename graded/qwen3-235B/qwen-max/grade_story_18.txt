<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters are sufficiently drawn but lack nuanced depth; Elira’s motivations are clear but understated, while Orin remains primarily symbolic with minimal internal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels compressed; resolutions are abrupt (lantern flicker, hair tie release) with minimal buildup, weakening emotional payoff despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (steam, drizzling rain) create atmosphere, but the steampunk setting lacks deeper integration with thematic elements of truth and memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (lantern, hair tie) supports the theme of release; subtextual tension between memory and progress resonates, though dialogue (minimal) feels overly poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains underexplored metaphors (calligraphy-flow ink) and slight overreliance on adjectives; tone is consistent but occasionally veers toward ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Generally cohesive but constrained by brevity; the final image (lantern flicker) feels hastily appended, undermining thematic resonance despite creative element usage.</comment>
