<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice but underdevelops motivation/personality nuance despite compelling setup; profession serves plot thinness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Premise drives action but lacks cohesive arc progression; abrupt character introduction disrupts cause-effect flow and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (damp wood, swaying chandelier) masterfully create haunting atmosphere; mansion as active entity enhances tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s by blending gothic and scientific ethics themes, but blood drive connection feels contrived rather than organic; atmospheric language occasionally borders on ornamental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative premise with strong atmosphere isn't sufficient for immediate publication; unresolved threads and underdeveloped emotional stakes require substantial refinement.</comment>
