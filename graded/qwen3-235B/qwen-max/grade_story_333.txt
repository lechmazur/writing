<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to preserve library traditions is clear and logically connected to her exploration of the passage, but her characterization as a "sincere rebel" lacks sufficient textual evidence to transcend cliché. Her internal conflict between bitterness and resolve remains underdeveloped beyond superficial gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot maintains logical cause-effect progression from the discovery of the sticky note to the realization about fear shaping the passage. However, the tight word count creates abrupt transitions between key revelations, particularly in the shift from physical carvings to their metaphysical significance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (damp earth, writhing carvings) effectively immerse readers in a decaying library atmosphere. The "between storms" timeframe metaphorically mirrors the protagonist's psychological tension, though atmospheric elements occasionally verge on Gothic clichés without deeper contextualization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The cyclical symbolism of the sticky note creates thematic resonance, and the final act demonstrates "showing" through Elira's action of placing the note on the wall. However, the explicit statement of her fear being "failure" undermines subtlety, and emotional impact relies too heavily on conceptual abstractions rather than fully embodied experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by reimagining a "haunted" space as collectively shaped by fear rather than supernatural forces. Some metaphors ("braided bitterness") approach artificiality, and the "constantly changing carvings" concept borrows heavily from familiar recursive narrative tropes without sufficiently innovative execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements demonstrate moderate cohesion: the sticky note serves as a narrative linchpin, and the theme of preserved traditions ties logically to the library setting. However, certain assigned components (especially "constantly changing") feel conceptually appended rather than organically integrated into the narrative's emotional core.</comment>
