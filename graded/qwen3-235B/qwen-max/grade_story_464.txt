<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but superficially executed; 'drifting arrogance' tone inconsistently applied; character actions feel archetypal rather than fully realized; voice lacks distinctive linguistic markers to justify 'sass' as character-defining trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clearly structured three-act arc despite constraints, but relies on mechanical cause-effect (camera/pouring stew => chaos) rather than organic progression; resolution feels more schematic than earned; pacing uneven in transitional moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Visually rich but sensory details prioritize style over emotional resonance; twilight setting creates mood but doesn't influence mechanics; calibration office's peculiarities remain superficially fantastical rather than thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Successfully employs metaphor (camera/puzzle, stew/fuel) and ironic contrast between chaos/perfection; lacks deeper philosophical interrogation; theme resonates thematically but subtext remains on-surface; competent but not transcendent craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mix of memorable concepts (reality-calibration) and clich√©d descriptors ('cheap wire', 'mechanical deity'); avoids major tropes but occasionally relies on familiar rebellion narratives; tonal consistency wavers between pseudo-profundity and genuine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Elements serviceable but unevenly weighted; forced connections in metaphorical 'treasure chests' concept; style alternates between vivid and overloaded; premise's potential exceeds execution's depth; leaves mild but not lingering impact.</comment>
