<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character’s coldness is established but remains surface-level; motivation for artistic awakening lacks psychological depth; actions like placing mitten are symbolic but under-developed; voice remains generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on finding the mitten but transitions between collecting folk remedies and rebellious acts feel disjointed; the tight arc is visible but resolution feels abrupt; pacing uneven but not entirely ineffective.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in cold, sterile settings with vivid contrasts (red mitten, fluorescent lights), but the conceptual clash between “knight” and “secret agent center” undermines coherence of the worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism of the mitten and altars evokes emotional resonance; ending’s thematic emphasis on small rebellions is memorable, but overt telling (“his rebellion was necessary”) weakens subtextual impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Combines knightly and espionage motifs with mixed success; avoids clichés in theme but relies on familiar “redemptive artifact” tropes; prose veers into ornate abstraction (“quiet revolution unfolding beneath its surface” detracts).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements feel loosely grafted to a predetermined structure rather than organically integrated; tone and setting linger, but thematic ambition outpaces execution.</comment>
