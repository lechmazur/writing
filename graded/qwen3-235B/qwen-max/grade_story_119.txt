<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's core traits (astral projector, "unyielding compassion") lack grounding in specific actions or decisions; the paradox "sometimes always" feels arbitrarily inserted rather than organically defining her psychology; inconsistent emotional rendering between stated motivations and demonstrated behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear chase structure but relies on unconvincing mechanisms ("tracking sun shadows" at night, sudden key revelations); coherence maintained through atmospheric tension rather than logical cause-effect progression; tight word limit exacerbates rushed transitions and underdeveloped spatial orientation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival setting richly realized through sensory details (cold air, metallic starlight reflections); shadow creatures create visceral menace; timeframe of immediate revelation execution strains credibility despite effective tension generation; setting-object connection (key as carnival relic) underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Imagery ("dying flame," "liquid fire") occasionally striking but often derivative; ending achieves circularity yet lacks thematic payoff; surface-level "showing" of survival mechanics overshadows deeper psychological/subtextual exploration; consistent conflict between physical/spiritual survival but underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Abandons carnival tropes with astral projection twist but falls into "warm/cold object as magical macguffin" clich√©; "sometimes always" mantra feels AI-generated abstraction rather than poetic subversion; inconsistent emotional nuance balances atmospheric specificity against occasionally formulaic phrasing ("writhing shadows," "gaping maw")</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interconnected depth; carnival setting works symbiotically with key's symbolism while "tracking sun shadows" disrupts momentum; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; survival skills motivation tenuously links to broader existential stakes without full realization.</comment>
