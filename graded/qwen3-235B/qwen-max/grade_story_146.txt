<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; the "faux fortune teller" duality isn't deeply explored, and emotional reactions lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent but rushed progression; the archive-to-elder transition feels abrupt, and the concept of "taken chances" isn't fully integrated into plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details create vivid atmosphere, but "peaceful anger" remains abstract and unearned through the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (flute, sacred cycles) adds depth, but the central conflict lacks tension, relying on mystical revelation over human struggle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but leans on familiar fantasy tropes (elder sage, magical relic). Language remains purposeful but occasionally veers into ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function but lack cohesion; the story would survive substitutions for "regularly seldom" and "planting season," weakening thematic unity.</comment>
