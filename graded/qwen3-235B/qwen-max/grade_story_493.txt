<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; "mysteriously cheerful" isn't deeply explored or nuanced in actions/dialogue; traits lack complex interplay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has coherent arc with logical cause-effect, but tight word limits leave some developments feeling abbreviated rather than organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Elements are skillfully incorporated but rarely transcendent; the constrained format enhances thematic focus while limiting full exploration of deeper implications.</grade>
