<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth beyond assigned traits; actions align with purpose, but 'factually imaginative' isn't fully embodied in distinct choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive concept but element integration varies; brevity feels intentional but leaves some ideas underdeveloped; lingers through thematic resonance rather than narrative complexity.</comment>
