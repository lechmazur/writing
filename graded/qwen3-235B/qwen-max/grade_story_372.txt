<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lovelorn spy lacks profession's nuance; motivation to outrun past is clear but disconnected from spy skills/missions. Emotional state hinted at through objects rather than deep interiority. Glove-removed interaction with sticky label reveals detachment but feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot contains clear arc (diner leads to rendezvous), but the label/note reveal strains believability within tight constraints. Urban exploration as method feels superficially attached rather than integral to plot progression. Ending provides focus shift but pacing hinges on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Detailed with tactile sensory decay (oil slick puddles, rust/grease smells) and visual paradoxes (neon vs. collapse). Atmosphere mirrors Kael's fractured psyche through environmental symbolism. Clocktower as meeting place adds spatial coherence between mood and plot destination.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (labyrinth of longing) clashes with overused metaphors (dying stars). Subtext about identity erosion in dystopia emerges but remains unexplored. Ending raises stakes but relies on clich√©d photo reveal rather than character-driven resolution. Shows more than tells, but tension between themes feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Formulaic dystopian elements (flickering neon, oil-slick reflections) lean into cyberpunk tropes without subversion. "Rambling destiny" tone manifests as vague fatalism rather than unique voice. Metaphors mostly conventional; emotional nuance limited to standard grief descriptors. Urban exploration mentioned but lacks technical specificity for authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements like sticky label and avalanche metaphor integrate better than others (e.g. urban exploration as shared interest, which appears solitary). Tight length works structurally but creates shortcut solutions (instant recipe revelation). Lingering question about Lira sustains curiosity but lacks thematic payoff from other elements.</comment>
