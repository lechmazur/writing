<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters have archetypal depth but insufficient internal logic; motivations for cosmic curiosity feel vague, and rivalries lack tangible personal stakes despite poetic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Focused on a pivotal moment but lacks structural urgency; the symbolic stamp overlap resolves little while the cloud-mirroring conceit strains plausibility within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory fusion of synthetic and organic (neon, mechanical whinnies), but the rooftop's spatial logic and time period's coherence falter under scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("vapor and wind") and layered symbols elevate impact, but dialogue leans on clich√©s and the ending prioritizes aesthetics over emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre autopilot (cyber-stables, cloud-reading) yet succumbs to ornamental prose and abrupt tonal shifts that suggest AI-generated flourishes without deeper authorial control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting vignette, but overreliance on atmospheric vagueness weakens thematic punch; brevity feels limiting rather than strategic.</comment>
