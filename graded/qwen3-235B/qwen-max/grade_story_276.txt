<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but some introspective moments feel underdeveloped. Actions align with traits, but emotional nuance in key moments could deepen impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc, though pacing feels slightly rushed during the resolution. The inciting incident (lurch) effectively drives the narrative, but the word limit constrains subplots.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is evocative with machine sounds and solemnity, but connections between some elements (e.g., picnics) and the core narrative remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (coathanger, tree) and thematic cohesion. The ending delivers emotional resonance, though some introspective passages border on telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and unique setting elevate originality. Avoids overt clich√©s but occasional phrasing (e.g., "desperate hands") veers toward conventionality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole with distinct thematic depth. The brevity works as a strength, though minor inconsistencies in tone slightly hinder overall impact.</comment>
