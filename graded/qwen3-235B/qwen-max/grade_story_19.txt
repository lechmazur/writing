<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conceptually coherent but lacks emotional depth; attributes present but not deeply explored through action or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Promising setup but underdeveloped structure; ending lacks resolution or catharsis despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create atmosphere; dandelion imagery and shifting light effectively enhance tone, though verges on familiar fantasy tropes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Blandly ornate phrasing in parts ("tiny stars adrift in cosmos"), but brass scale/receipt code show ingenuity amid genre conventions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused; story remains elegant abstraction without resonant thematic synthesis or urgency.</comment>
