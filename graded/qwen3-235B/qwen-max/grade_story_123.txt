<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Gleeful moroseness is superficially shown through actions but lacks deeper psychological exploration; motivation to rekindle the realm drives the plot but feels underdeveloped in its connection to the brewer's specific skills or identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and cohesive within constraints, with sweeping action initiating discovery, but the resolution at dawn feels abrupt, lacking incremental tension or earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust, starlight, cold air) and the haunting atmosphere of decay effectively underscore the theme of forgotten history; setting and timeframe harmonize but lack explicit connections to imperial transitions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (whispering boots, "faith" of star-mapping scholars) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance; ending hints at subtext about cyclical history but lacks sufficient thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrases risk romanticizing nostalgia ("whispering secrets of those who walked under starlit skies") but avoid overt clich√©s; emotional depth is shown through objects rather than stated, though the brewer's occupation feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive melancholic whole, but the narrative's brevity limits deeper exploration of its ambitious themes; the ending is conceptually satisfying but emotionally distant.</comment>
