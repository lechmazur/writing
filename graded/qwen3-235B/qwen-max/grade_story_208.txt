<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s motivation tied to generic regret; pen-driven memories show depth but lack nuanced psychological complexity. Emotional reactions feel partially authentic but rely on surface-level descriptions rather than visceral, idiosyncratic introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot leverages the pen’s rewind as a magical device effectively, but pacing is uneven. The abrupt shifts between memories and the postal facility strain coherence, though the end ties to the beginning with emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends industrial sterility and spectral memory, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid. The postal facility’s coldness contrasts with the pen’s warmth, yet fails to deepen character or concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storytelling blends potent imagery ("note onto the air") with thematic depth. The resolution subverts clichéd catharsis, but relies on told emotions ("he felt free") and underexplored subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lacks fully fresh metaphors; employs magical realism tropes without subversion. Emotional shifts border on AI-generated affective cues, but the blend of wry humor and regret offers a humanized twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere unevenly; the pen anchors the story, but the postal facility feels arbitrary. Length serves the arc but strains cause-effect logic, leaving resonant questions without overexplained resolution.</comment>
