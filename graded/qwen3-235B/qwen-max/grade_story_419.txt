<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains flat; "no-nonsense" traits don't clash with supernatural sensitivity, creating inconsistency. Motivation to "show humanity's heart still beats" arrives abruptly without earned emotional context. Actions feel narratively convenient rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of discovery and resolution, but pivotal moment (ornament syncing with heartbeats) lacks buildup. The action of "mollifying" spirits works within the word limit but resolution feels rushed - too many nights of spirit calming condensed into one underdeveloped sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere expertly established through sensory details - dust clinging, whispering dolls, rusted wood smells - creates immersive haunted museum setting. Shadows flickering in corners provide effective visual motif. Tension between Elias' steady presence and the restless spirits amplifies the mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Symbolism of stained glass as "human heart" is heavy-handed rather than subtle. Ending statement about humanity enduring lacks earned emotional weight. Central conflict exists (humanity's fading legacy) but resolution through glowing ornament feels simplistic rather than profound. Story tells more than it shows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Haunted dollhouse setting and mystical object tropes border on clich√©. While avoiding machine-like repetition of phrases, the empathic blacksmith character follows archetypal patterns without fresh subversion. Spiritual resolution through heartbeat syncing leans on familiar resonance metaphor rather than offering novel interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</comment><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements but doesn't transcend them. Brevity works for atmosphere but constrains character and thematic depth. The idea of preserved traditions persists after humans fade carries conceptual interest but remains underexplored. Certain elements feel checklisted rather than organically integrated.</comment>
