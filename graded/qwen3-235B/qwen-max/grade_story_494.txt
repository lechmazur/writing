<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is defined by juxtaposition of arrogance and doubt but lacks deeper psychological complexity; motivation is clear but underexplored in terms of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed; cause-effect logic holds but pacing feels rushed, particularly in the abrupt shift from confrontation to internal revelation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting and object details (moonlit courtyard, tapestry) create atmosphere, but sensory descriptions remain superficial rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (phoenix, shackled potential) and theme of legacy function effectively, though emotional impact is diluted by occasionally static dialogue and reliance on familiar arcs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but treads familiar ground (lonely warrior, wise old mentor); lyrical prose and symbolic synthesis elevate the conceptual backbone beyond formulaic structure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a complete narrative, but brevity imposes limitations on thematic development; lingering resonance comes primarily from archetypal resonance and imagery.</comment>
