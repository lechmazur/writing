<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Flat, archetypal character with hollow motivation; no inner conflict or evolution. Dialogue feels scripted, lacking psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cohesive in premise but lacks resolution. Pacing is uneven—exposition-heavy beginning, arbitrary descent into tunnels. Plot feels truncated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visually vivid but tonally inconsistent. Hydroponic farm’s mechanical dullness contrasts oddly with mystical pulse—underexploited tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</comment>Relies on poetic imagery to mask shallow emotional engagement. Metaphors (“flag of quiet defiance”) are facile. Premise’s intellectual stakes remain unearned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Uses genre tropes (labyrinth, quest) without reinvention. Purple prose (“xenophobic skies”) distracts. Dialogue and pacing suggest algorithmic pattern-following.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but lack thematic synergy. Atmosphere hints at depth; execution prioritizes aesthetics over substance.</comment>
