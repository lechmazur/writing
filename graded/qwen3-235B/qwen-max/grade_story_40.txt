<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are consistent but underdeveloped beyond surface traits; the "tentatively fierce" attribute lacks integration with decisive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on convenient contrivances (storm, Leo's introduction); pacing uneven in the compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details, effectively mirroring the protagonist's introspective turmoil and the story's themes of decay and renewal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into familiar emotional beats; prose is purposeful but risks preciousness with symbolic objects.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained by reliance on assigned elements; some forced integration (e.g., storm, doctor’s chart) weakens organic flow.</comment>
