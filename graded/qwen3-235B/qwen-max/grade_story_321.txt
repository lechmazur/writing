<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character displays internal conflict but remains thinly developed; motivations tied to guilt and forgiveness are clear yet lack personal history grounding them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but resolution feels abrupt; hourglass visions drive plot yet transitions between memories and action lack sufficient structural scaffolding for emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Infernal kitchen's oppressive details effectively mirror character's psyche; sensory descriptions like "soot and grease" and "thick air" masterfully establish mood that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphor use (hourglass as reckoning device, crumbling ribbon as imperfect remorse) elevate craft; emotional impact diluted by underdeveloped backstory despite evocative prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but contains familiar redemptive arcs; some abstract phrasing ("cosmic silence") approaches purple prose while ritualistic hourglass interaction feels conceptually derivative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated with thematic intention yet occasionally forced (timeframe/setting disconnect); ending provokes thought rather than closing with definitive narrative force.</comment>
