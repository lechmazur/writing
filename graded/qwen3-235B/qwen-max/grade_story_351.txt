<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's poetic nature is present but thinly sketched; rebellious trait isn't demonstrated through meaningful action or interaction with the sundial; emotional reactions to revelations feel generic rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot trajectory from riddle-solving to revelation follows logical chain, but compressed arc feels schematic; transitions gloss over key character decisions that would create narrative urgency; resolution arrives abruptly without earned emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered with textured sensory details that mirror thematic concerns; however, the setting functions more as tableau than active participant - the railway station's history doesn't tangibly intersect with the character's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic throughlines with sundial/time/erasure motifs; ending delivers thematic coherence but relies on abstract statement over embodied showing; poetic language elevates material while occasionally veering toward ornamental abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Circular family mystery structure feels familiar; some description veers into decorative overgrowth with phrases like "fragments of memory and mystery"; emotional beats rely on well-worn motifs of inheritance and rediscovery without distinctive authorial vision emerging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements combine into thematically unified whole but lack alchemical synergy; constraints are managed competently rather than brilliantly; thematic resonance lingers faintly but could leave stronger imprint through sharper dramatic embodiment.</comment>
