<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Credential-driven motivation lacks human nuance. Character's contradictions (nonchalant/yet obsessive about chaos) feel conceptually assigned rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable transformation arc; pivotal scene where manuscript glows feels abruptly inserted without sufficient narrative groundwork in tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Steampunk setting contains generic sensory details; storm-as-metaphor lacks deeper integration with mechanical environment. Atmosphere supports theme superficially rather than organically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strained metaphors and lyrical abstraction outweigh meaningful literary devices. Ending's emotional impact feels attenuated by vague "horizon of madness" motif. Attempts at subtext remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vocabulary occasionally borders on purple prose; narrative voice too frequently resorts to poetic abstraction rather than showing concrete human experience. Steampunk elements feel formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly synthesised; story feels engineered to incorporate checklist items rather than organically evolved. Lingering impression is decorative rather than profound.</comment>
