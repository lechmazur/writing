<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation connects to his past but the open-mindedness isn't fully integrated into his actions. His decision to speak lacks nuanced internal logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Framing device works but pacing feels compressed. The talent show's relevance to the core conflict is underdeveloped, weakening the narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Evocative details create mood but atmospheric elements don't deepen the character's dilemma. Speakeasy's secrecy contrasts poorly with the family-friendly talent show.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some fresh choices in combining speakeasy and talent show elements, but relies on predictable "fragile object = inner fragility" trope without subverting expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't synergize fully. The conceptual framework is occasionally strained, particularly with the incongruous talent show setting.</comment>
