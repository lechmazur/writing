<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's ruthlessness lacks visible demonstration beyond terseness. The 'intellectually spontaneous' trait influences her curiosity but remains underexplored. The comb's significance isn't fully integrated into her psychological depth or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels compressed. The comb-scraping revelation drives momentum, yet transitions between introspection and external action are uneven. The resolution is abrupt, leaving thematic threads loosely tied.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (hum of tires, metallic scrape). The stone circle's mystery aligns with the cryptic carvings and eerie harmonica, but the timeframe's poetic metaphor ("pause between verses") feels decorative rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("carvings as unruly bouquets") and subtextual layers elevate the narrative. The ending's emotional resonance—shifting from isolated analysis to communal connection—adds depth. Dialogue is natural and thematically purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "unruly bouquet" are effective but occasionally verge on cliché. Sensory details occasionally drift toward generic ("whispered melodies") rather than visceral specificity. Avoids overt formulaicity but lacks consistently fresh linguistic choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion exists, but elements feel occasionally additive rather than synergistic. The comb and harmonica provide clever mechanics, yet the story leans on atmospheric shorthand. The theme of connection lingers, but tighter integration of components could enhance originality.</comment>
