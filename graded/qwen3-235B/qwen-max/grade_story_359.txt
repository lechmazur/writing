<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation and internal conflict are present but underdeveloped; absent-mindedness occasionally surfaces but doesn't deeply shape actions or personality beyond surface descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Moment-to-moment progression works, but the arc remains truncated—resolution feels abrupt despite attempts to tie beginning/end; thematic coherence outpaces narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Specific sensory details (brass lion's gleam, station sounds) create atmosphere, but AI timeframe integration is shallow; setting evokes mood but lacks visceral worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dialogue and metaphors (sound as memory, brewing as kinesthized experience) convey themes effectively, though emotional depth occasionally slips into abstraction without sufficient grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar imagery ("ivy," "storms of doubt"); character psychology feels slightly schematic rather than organic despite conversational nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack electrifying synergy—story feels conceptually sound but not indispensably shaped by its components, occasionally substitutable within framework.</comment>
