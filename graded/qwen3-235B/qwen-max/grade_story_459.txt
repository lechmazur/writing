<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's ghost-seeing ability drives the plot but "elegantly clumsy" doesn't meaningfully shape actions. Motivation to "let go" feels underexplored given limited word count. Character reactions to flower crown lack emotional depth despite heavy thematic emphasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Assigned action (dissecting whispers) is intriguing but underdeveloped. Plot structure shows promise in premise but lacks narrative momentum. Connection between finding flower crown and waiting in lab feels disjointed. Pacing drags in middle despite brief word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sand castle preservation lab has evocative potential but atmosphere remains underutilized. Sensory details are generic rather than specific. Setting doesn't meaningfully interact with central character or themes. "Dissonance of silence" is stated rather than created through effective description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story creates mild emotional resonance through ghost elements but relies too heavily on atmospheric telling rather than showing. Literary devices feel conventional rather than original. Theme of "letting go" is present but thin. Ending creates vague anticipation rather than meaningful resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Familiar ghost-seer trope lacks innovation. Overuse of phrases like "whispers that lingered like ghosts" feels clich√©d. Emotional states are often stated rather than demonstrated through action. Writing style occasionally veers into needlessly ornate descriptions without adding meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Story incorporates many assigned elements but struggles with cohesion. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful. Unique combination of elevator technician and sand castle preservation lab lacks deeper significance. Narrative doesn't leave lasting impression or provoke meaningful reflection.</comment>
