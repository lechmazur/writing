<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation to archive rituals is clear but underdeveloped; the wanderer's stoicism lacks emotional depth to make actions feel earned or psychologically coherent beyond surface resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progression is linear but feels rushed, relying on abrupt transitions (e.g., instant recognition of the floorboard's significance); the ending resolution lacks emotional payoff despite strong central concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details (e.g., "brash tenderness") but setting elements like the witch's training ground feel decorative rather than integral to the character's journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "whispers of necessary lies" and thematic tension between truth/obfuscation elevate impact; dialogue is purposeful but occasionally slips into mystical pseudo-profundity rather than layered meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction without earned specificity (e.g., "fragile truth"); avoids major tropes through oblique phrasing but relies too heavily on paradoxical descriptors as shorthand for depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not fully synergistic; the witch's setting and "necessary lies" concept feel artificially layered onto a generic quest narrative rather than organically intertwined.</comment>
