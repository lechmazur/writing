<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character has surface motivation but lacks depth; actions serve plot more than internal logic. Voice remains indistinct despite introspective elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through incident rather than sustained tension; pivotal events feel episodic. Pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vividly rendered setting with tactile details, atmospheric coherence between rusted relics and existential decay of protagonist.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (shard as truth) and subtext about self-deception, but dialogue and awakening feel overly literal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Echoes genre tropes (mechanical creatures, attic discovery) but subverts minimally. Avoids purple prose but occasionally favors abstraction over specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Story adheres to constraints but sacrifices emotional resonance and thematic complexity. Premise exceeds execution.</comment>
