<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weakly realized character; motivations are clear but lack depth beyond the surface level of seeking connection through objects. The "eager lookout" trait isn't meaningfully demonstrated through actions or decisions. The sewing box interaction suggests latent personality but fails to fully integrate with Lucan's central conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression follows a clean spatial logic (atrium → triclinium → garden → tablinum) but leans heavily on implied rather than dramatized cause-effect chains. Pacing manages to feel both rushed in emotional beats and overly deliberate in cleaning details. Ends with a partial resolution that satisfies the immediate ghost mystery but leaves thematic goals ambiguously achieved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions blend Roman architectural elements with modern museum gloss. The tactile details (polished wood, mosaics) and spatial transitions immerse readers effectively, though the fusion of ancient/modern is under-interrogated. "Ruthless kindness" tone manifests strongest in environmental descriptions, where history’s weight simultaneously comforts and unsettles.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of thread and weaving connects to the sewing box and tapestry, offering symbolic cohesion. The ending’s discovery lacks emotional payoff due to sparse characterization, but the central tension of seeking meaning in fragmented remnants remains conceptually compelling. Prose excels in sensory specifics but falters in elevating theme beyond melancholic nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on haunted house tropes (whispers, cold spots) without subverting them. Sensory language is occasionally specific but repetitive—"marble floors," "moss"—and occasionally awkward ("technically organic wood"). Emotional contours stay on the surface; the "digital age" conflict is stated but not dynamically explored through Lucan’s actions or reflections.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively enough to create a mood-driven narrative, though none feel indispensable beyond facilitating the setting’s atmosphere. The story’s brevity works thematically but creates resolution gaps in character psychology. Leaves some thematic resonance about material memory but lacks piercing originality or urgency.</comment>
