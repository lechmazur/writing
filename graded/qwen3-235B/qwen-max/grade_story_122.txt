<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character history is hinted at but lacks depth; motivations about safety as a mirage are stated rather than dramatized; reactions to objects and concepts remain abstract rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Storm ritual drives the action but lacks narrative stakes or clear cause-effect progression; beginning/end bookend but offer minimal emotional or thematic resolution; pacing oscillates between lingered description and abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Storm and skeletal remains create a vivid atmosphere, but the fusion of cyber-templar technology with spiritual burial rituals feels underexplored; sensory details are evocative but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (lightning as chaos, refraction as revelation) elevate the narrative; themes of illusion vs. truth resonate, though emotional impact is diluted by abstract prose; ending feels symbolic rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on cyberpunk/post-apocalyptic clich√©s (digital entropy, fractured purpose); excessive ornate descriptions verge on purple prose; character reasoning prioritizes poetic abstraction over human nuance; tonal shifts between mysticism and tech lack cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist without seamless integration; brevity undermines thematic development; style occasionally elevates content but often obscures emotional clarity; conceptual ambition outweighs execution.</comment>
