<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's singular motivation is clear but lacks emotional complexity; actions align with assigned traits but depth is sacrificed for brevity. The hair clip symbolizes past purpose but isn't sufficiently connected to her current identity or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but pacing feels rushed in emotional transitions; cause/effect between lab backstory and wedding toast climax lacks grounding. Assigned elements shape structure but resolution feels artificially tidy within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Contrast between sterile lab and vibrant restaurant creates effective atmosphere, but sensory details remain surface-level. "Primal sophistication" described rather than embodied through grounded environmental specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (sunrise as hope) and imagery (waves on pond) elevate thematic resonance. Ending balances hope without saccharine sentiment, but emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown through character actions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</comment><comment>Premise avoids overt tropes but relies on familiar "last hope" narrative structures. Language occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction that muddies concrete stakes. Subtext about narrative power is compelling but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story feels intentionally compact but thematic ambition strains against word limit. Assigned elements function narratively but lack deeper synthesisâ€”wedding setting and research lab remain tonally disconnected despite attempts at thematic unification.</comment>
