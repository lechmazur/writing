<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is underdeveloped with clichéd traits; motivation is clear but reacts to elements through predictable emotional beats without psychological nuance or transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a vague arc but lacks narrative momentum; the action-concept connection is disjointed, with abrupt shifts between introspection and supernatural elements undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral time and library visuals create atmosphere, but the waterfall setting feels like an empty fantasy trope; sensory details are evocative but inconsistently tied to character motivation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (frost patterns as memories) and symbolic objects (leaves as eroded time) elevate impact; the ending’s emotional resonance is undercut by sentimental undertones but remains poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors (frost-veins, library as "embers") counterbalance generic phrases ("heart carried a weight"); avoids major tropes but relies on melancholy-artist clichés for motivation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>The story weaves elements into a cohesive atmosphere but struggles with thematic focus; brevity exacerbates unresolved tensions between regret and transcendence, leaving depth underexplored.</grade>
