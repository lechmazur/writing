<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias's motivation for silent retribution is clear but his "clumsily dexterous" trait feels underdeveloped. While his hands' contradictory nature is mentioned, it doesn't deeply shape his personality. The stained glass fragment reveals his obsession with transformation, but his internal psychology remains sketchy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a tight arc but feels compressed. The method (sound manipulation via pantomime) lacks detailed logic. The transition from workshop to public square feels abrupt. Cause/effect connections work, but pacing suffers under the word limit, particularly in the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (burnt herbs, cauldron glow) create an oppressive atmosphere. The witch’s room complements the theme of unstable reality. However, the stained glass/phonograph fusion of sacred/secular elements feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of perceptual manipulation and retribution resonate, but emotional connection to Elias is shallow. The "sonic void" metaphor is striking, while the ending's hollow silence evokes existential unease. Lacks deeper subtext about art's social power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the sound engineer witchcraft hybrid. Avoids crowd-pleasing tropes, though "hush of a chalkboard" leans on abstract vagueness. The stained glass as sound-prism is inventive. Pantomime confession method avoids cliché but needed clearer mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematic whole (sound/silence, fragility of certainty) but some (witch's room) feel decorative. The brevity works for mystery but hinders character depth. Leaves questions about perception vs. reality, though emotional impact remains indirect.</comment>
