<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's unknowing heir status lacks concrete manifestation; motivations are poetic but psychologically unexplored. Internal conflict hinted through abstract desires rather than distinct personality traits or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot relies on symbolic connections between spoon, murals, and mountain rather than causal logic. Pacing manages circular structure within constraints but lacks mechanical tension or irreversible stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (projector hum, peeling murals, magnetic scent) create immersive decay. Atmosphere of faded grandeur complements existential themes, though mountain's mechanics remain vaguely defined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (spoon as legacy conduit, churning as creative act) resonate, but emotional impact diluted by generalized yearning. Ending's symbolic purposefulness contradicts underdeveloped character psychology.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Combines archetypal orphan narratives with fresh geological symbolism. Some phrases ("laughable and unbearable") and emotional beats feel algorithmically curated rather than deeply imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (ruin as catalyst for reinvention), but precise narrative function of mountain and spoon remains speculative. Style elevates premise though depth remains surface-level.</comment>
