<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's agoraphobia and inherited burden are established but underexplored; motivation to break free feels simplistic despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to action, but the abrupt transition from rain-soaked office to dunes undermines emotional weight within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting's sensory details (rain, whispers) create atmosphere, but the dunes mythos lacks depth, prioritizing mystique over tangible geography.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (snuffbox as burden, rain as guidance) enrich subtext; ending's forward-looking ambiguity complements themes without closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on inherited-legacy tropes; atmospheric prose occasionally borders on purple without losing coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but lack revelatory depth; the brevity serves setup over thematic payoff despite disciplined integration.</comment>
