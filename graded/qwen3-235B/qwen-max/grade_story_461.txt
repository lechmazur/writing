<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but could use deeper exploration of how generational trauma manifests specifically. Sardonic voice is consistent but occasionally too arch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity but meditation sequence feels rushed. Pacing lags slightly in middle before tightening for resolution. Logical progression maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually rich with specific sensory details (crackled spines, maternal warmth), but "static floorboards" concept remains underutilized atmospheric potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive but lacks narrative daring. Metaphors work (generational "chaos"), yet ancestral visions feel somewhat predictable rather than transcendent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with original concept blending inherited trauma with magical realism. Some slightly ornate phrasing but maintains distinct voice throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively despite complexity, though meditation method feels narratively convenient. Strong thematic foundation but requires tighter structural execution.</comment>
