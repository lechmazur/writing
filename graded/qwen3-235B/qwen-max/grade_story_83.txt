<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character’s "suspiciously trusting" trait is stated but underexplored; motivations are clear but lack nuanced emotional depth, and dialogue lacks distinct voice despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through wick-tracing but relies on abrupt revelations; cause-effect logic exists, yet pacing feels rushed, and the abrupt ending leaves coherence hanging despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (burnt wax, shifting mirrors) effectively build eerie atmosphere; setting enhances mood, but deeper integration of the lab’s history could strengthen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses motifs like reflection and duality for layered meaning, but dialogue clichés ("double-edged sword") and an underdeveloped conflict limit emotional resonance and thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some trope reliance (abandoned lab, ancient symbols) and predictable phrasing undercut originality; metaphors like "whispers from another world" lean generic, though the spiral wick’s design offers a fresh twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are present but inconsistently fused—leaf raking and plastic tray feel forced—while tone and setting show cohesion; ambitious themes outpace the word limit’s constraints.</comment>
