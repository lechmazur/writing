<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or deep psychological motivation; actions follow a vague sense of purpose without clear personal stakes or emotional resonance. The deputy's traits feel imposed rather than organically revealed through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional narrative arc but maintains thematic cohesion. The action's progression feels meandering rather than purposeful, with atmospheric elements substituting for structural necessity. Some cause-effect logic diluted by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion with cathedral/orchard juxtaposition. Atmosphere meticulously constructed through paradoxical imagery (gravity-defying nature, stained-glass light). Tone consistently merges decay with vitality, though symbolic weight occasionally overwhelms narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (twist tie as symbolic key, bee flight patterns as text) creates intellectual resonance. Ending provides minimal resolution yet lingers conceptually. Subtext about order/discovery is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avant-garde approach avoids genre tropes while occasionally lapsing into self-admiring prose ("personally impersonal" phrasing risks pretension). Balances specificity with mystery but stumbles in overwrought descriptors ("uncharted echoes of life thriving where none should exist").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into a singular mood rather than traditional narrative, making it more impressionistic poem than story. Atmospheric integrity compensates for missing narrative momentum, with themes of hidden patterns and sacredness in decay emerging organically.</comment>
