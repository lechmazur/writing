<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's dual identity lacks sufficient behavioral grounding; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through specific actions; symbolic use of the ink blotter reveals some depth but feels more thematic than psychologically authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear symbolic arc but pacing is uneven; sudden introduction of the robed figure creates narrative whiplash; thematic resolution satisfactory but structural transitions between key moments lack narrative glue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid incense and crumbling architecture create immersive atmosphere, but cultural specifics of the temple setting remain underdeveloped; cosmic imagery effectively mirrors internal struggles but lacks concrete physical details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mixed success with literary devices: constellations and chains offer strong symbolism but metaphors occasionally become heavy-handed; emotional impact undercut by overly explanatory dialogue; theme of self-imposed limitations compellingly rendered through symbolic objects.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Many phrases border on pretentious abstraction ("incense and daring caution"); reliance on Jungian shadow tropes without fresh perspective; voice alternates between poetic precision and artificial profundity; character psychology feels conceptually mapped rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres superficially but lacks visceral emotional grounding; elements serve theme but strain plausibility; brevity creates elegance but sacrifices necessary character complexity; elevated prose sometimes obscures authentic human resonance.</comment>
