<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains broadly sketched; motivation clear but underexplored. Emotional connection lacks depth despite clear goal—wisdom-seeking is too abstract to ground her decisions. Reactions to visions and revelations feel unnuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but strains under word count—transitions between visions feel abrupt. The unraveling method drives key moments but resolution feels slightly rushed, with the archive revelation lacking earned weight within the confined structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting: decaying flora, tactile descriptions of decay, and the greenhouse’s metaphorical role as a mausoleum for extinct life create a haunting atmosphere that deeply supports the story’s themes of loss and discovery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (stitch-as-history) and symbolic imagery, but emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on poetic abstraction. The ending’s thematic pivot to “perception vs. reality” is clear but feels more lectured than shown through visceral narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some passages (e.g., “ghosts’ breath,” “plants bowing”) risk poetic excess without deeper innovation. The quilt-as-ancient-repository archetype leans on familiar mysticism tropes without subverting them, though the wristband’s integration is a fresh twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Irregular cohesion: the greenhouse’s ecological decay and quilt’s historical depth intersect intriguingly but lack tighter thematic synthesis. The constrained length occasionally hinders emotional payoff, though the final image (stepping into light) lingers as a strong closing gesture.</comment>
