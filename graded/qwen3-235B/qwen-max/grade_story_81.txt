<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with theme but lack distinct personality beyond archetypal 'advisor' role. Limited emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Minimal plot progression; vignette structure works but lacks traditional conflict. Pacing controlled, though resolution feels abstract rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details like decay/renewal duality and rusting fence. Time-dilated zone creates haunting visual coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (coin/driftwood) deepens theme of temporal continuity. Ending resonates thematically though emotional impact leans on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some lush descriptions border on overwrought; avoids formulaic tropes but occasionally substitutes density for emotional specificity. Voice maintains consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate aesthetically but narrative lacks visceral engagement. Stylistic ambition exceeds emotional payoff within constrained format.</comment>
