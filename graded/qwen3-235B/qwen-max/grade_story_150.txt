<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (spark curiosity) is clear but inconsistently manifested through actions; "outlaw" aspect underexplored except title; poet identity only hinted through dice-rolling, not voice or dialogue. Reckless instinctual behavior dominates, lacking nuanced cowboy archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Misalignment action drives plot but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect logical (dice→coffee wall→telescope) but lacks escalation; compressed word limit strains character journey; ending revelations lack payoff context; tight structure but sacrifices emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory excels through sensory machinery details (oil, ozone, gaslight), yet coffee shop wall feels jarring within dome's logic; "shimmering constellations" visualize theme effectively but atmospheric dissonance between mechanical setting and mystical elements weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ending's "stories written in light" offers conceptual resonance but emotional engagement remains superficial; metaphors for interconnectedness underdeveloped; writing style polished but prioritizes setting over character interiority; tension between determinism and chaos introduced but not fully interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dice/ambivalence concepts combat genre tropes but coffee shop walls as fortune-telling device feels derivative; "saturated ambivalence" told rather than shown; poetic descriptions occasionally turn purple ("persistent coyote" simile); consistent tonal contrast between mechanical precision and mystical discovery maintained despite uneven phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stylistic competence saves from disjointedness but elements operate in parallel rather than concert; short length suits conceptual punch but sacrifices thematic payoff; steampunk setting provides visual cohesion; ending concept strong but insufficiently grounded in character stakes.</comment>
