<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orin’s surly nature is consistent, but his internal conflict lacks depth; motivation is clear but not fully nuanced. His reaction to the yarn reveals tradition’s weight, yet emotional layers feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The riddle propels the plot toward the elder’s lesson, but the weaving process feels rushed. Causal links hold, yet pacing strains slightly under the word limit; resolution ties into thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting evokes tactile decay and ethereal beauty. Sensory details immerse readers; the “dignified chaos” of the graveyard mirrors cosmic themes. Connection to timeframe (“between seasons”) remains loosely realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (yarn, net, knots) resonate with cosmic subtext. Ending balances poignancy and restraint; theme of understanding over control emerges clearly. Relies slightly too much on stated epiphany vs. shown nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar desolate imagery (“salt-crusted bones,” “tattered sails”). Emotional beats are affecting yet verge on predictable. Style avoids purple prose but could sharpen specificity in descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere around existential inquiry; the yarn and graveyard are integral. Some forced ties (market wisdom, timeframe). Brevity amplifies the story’s metaphysical leanings without feeling truncated.</comment>
