<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but psychological depth lacks full realization; reactions to memory recovery feel abstract rather than visceral. The midwife's role in shaping decisions remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chronological throughline is solid despite tight word limits, though the ritual's progression and resolution occur at a speed that slightly undermines emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Visceral sensory tapestry and symbolic setting integration—the orchard as psyche metaphor—are masterfully executed with rich atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense with resonant metaphor (maelstrom = inner turmoil) and thematic richness; some surface-level "showing" of memories through sensations could lean less heavily into abstractness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original mythopoetic logic free of genre clichés; occasional overreliance on phrase templates ("heart of the island") prevents perfect originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a singular philosophical thesis; the brevity enhances poetic impact though certain emotional complexities remain compressed.</comment>
