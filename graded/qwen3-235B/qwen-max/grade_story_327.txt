<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (unfocused creative ambition) is clear but relies heavily on passive reactions rather than active choices; the merchant's role lacks sufficient contextual grounding within the world to create compelling dynamic</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Premise establishes strong initial momentum but resolution feels abrupt; narrative cohesion strained by convenient road closure contrivance that disrupts organic plot development</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story maintains surface-level cohesion but many assigned elements feel mechanically inserted rather than organically integrated; thematic takeaway remains superficial despite promising conceptual foundations</comment>
