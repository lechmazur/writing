<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character shows internal conflict but relies heavily on exposition over nuanced behavior; motivation is clear but lacks layered development that would make the spiritual crisis feel viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has forward motion but lacks meaningful progression; the golden fruit revelation feels unearned as the narrative prioritizes atmosphere over cause-effect logic within the constrained arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dreamlike setting is vividly rendered with sensory details that amplify existential themes, though the bean stalks' significance remains underexploited beyond visual grandeur.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Cohesion strained by elements like snow patterns; some components feel conceptually adjacent rather than integrally fused within the tight structure.</comment>
