<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains distant and underexplored; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or nuanced internal conflict. The quilt and stamps hint at depth but lack integration with his personality's evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative progression is coherent but uneven; the discovery of the power station and quilt ritual provide structure, though the abrupt mystical resolution lacks causal grounding, weakening the arc's satisfying completion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (rust scent, refracted light) create a haunting underwater atmosphere; the decayed setting mirrors Elias's psychological state, though deeper integration with plot mechanics could strengthen cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stamps and quilt carry symbolic weight, but emotional resonance is diluted by abrupt metaphysical elements. The central conflict (longing for transformation) is clear but undercut by underdeveloped subtext and uneven showing vs. telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and metaphorical undertones exist, but occasionally veer into ornate abstraction. Some tropes (e.g., "dead end life") and abrupt tonal shifts suggest formulaic tendencies, though the core premise retains individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are broadly cohesive but unevenly weighted; the quilt and stamps feel integral, while the power station's specifics and "objectively biased" motivation seem opportunistic. Concision feels restrictive rather than intentional, though the final image lingers.</comment>
