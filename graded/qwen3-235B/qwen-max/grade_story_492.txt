<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character shows motivation but lacks depth; actions align with traits yet remain surface-level. Nuance in internal conflict is missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression via infiltration is logical but feels truncated; beginning/middle/end coherence exists but lacks emotional crescendo within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "save-the-world" frameworks; prose is purposeful yet occasionally veers into ornate phrasing without fresh metaphoric impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently woven together but lack transformative cohesion; ending feels functional rather than haunting or thought-provoking.</comment>
