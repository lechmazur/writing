<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (honoring an impossible promise) is clear but lacks depth in showing how Elias' curiosity drives his pragmatic actions. The ring box's significance is hinted at but doesn't fully reveal his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a fragmented arc—strong start in the graveyard, but the middle lacks escalation and the ending's "single note" feels underdeveloped. Rain patterns as a method lack logical connection to the ship graveyard's secrets.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (briny water, splintered wood, storm sounds) immerse readers in a haunting atmosphere. The decaying ship graveyard and cosmic intimacy tone complement each other seamlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story evokes melancholy through poignant metaphor (storms as whispers, rain as impatient fingers). The theme of unfulfilled promises resonates, though the ending leans on poetic vagueness over narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on ornate descriptions ("cosmic intimacy," "cacophony"). Emotions are shown through environment more than character nuance, with fresh metaphors ("broken teeth") offsetting slightly formulaic pacing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements like the ring box and graveyard work cohesively, but the rain pattern motif feels awkwardly imposed. The story sacrifices some clarity for poetic brevity, leaving the central conflict under-explained yet emotionally evocative.</comment>
