<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elira's morbid profession shapes her connection to death/recycling but lacks concrete details of her floristry practice. The motivation to understand cosmic cycles drives the story but her "neutral passion" remains underexplored through specific behavioral examples. The candle illuminates her inner conflict but more showing of her professional rituals would strengthen character-function connections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Steady progression from contemplation to ritual enactment demonstrates effective pacing. The writer's trunk as catalyst works, though the connection between obeying ancient requests and cosmic understanding needs slightly more narrative scaffolding. The self-contained arc (opening trunk → candle ignition → realization) satisfies within constraints, though the trembling dojo's significance emerges abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Moonlit flora, crackling stone, and shifting celestial patterns create multi-sensory immersion. The guttering lantern timeframe establishes urgency through dying light versus eternal stars. Floating rock dojo's living quality emerges organically through responsive tremors rather than mere description. Atmosphere perfectly mirrors the "boldly timid" tone through contrasts between fragile candle vs cosmic scale.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (candle potential vs cosmic vastness) and subtextual theme of surrender over control resonate powerfully. The ending avoids pat resolutions while providing emotional closure. Epiphany about releasing certainty has universal resonance but might benefit from more concrete sensory reactions (trembling hands, changed perception of flowers). The conflict between human smallness and cosmic connection remains compellingly complex.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Some similes ("whispering secrets") border on cliché but are offset by fresh combinations like "chaotic beauty." Emotional progression feels earned rather than formulaic. The "neutrally passionate" concept avoids standard tropes but requires more specific behavioral evidence. The dojo's sentience avoids easy fantasy templates through subtle motion cues rather than overt magical explanations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels intentional rather than checklist-driven. The floristry background supports cosmic themes more seamlessly than the trunk's backstory. Writing style consistently favors evocative brevity over excess prose. The story lingers thematically through questions about certainty vs wisdom rather than neat answers. The brief form enhances the mythic quality rather than feeling restrictive.</comment>
