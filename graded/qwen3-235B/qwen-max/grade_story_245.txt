<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some nuance in Kael's emotional journey, but motivations (betrayal, search for waterfalls) rely on surface indicators rather than deep psychological layers; reactions to chopstick/tea ritual show character but lack complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid circular structure (memory ritual framing), but pacing uneven in conveying Kael's psychological shift; emotional arc compressed rather than earned through cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric fusion of derelict spaceport and spiritual ritual creates compelling contrasts; strong sensory details (scuffed deck, metallic bitterness of steam) anchor the tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (liquid silver truth, rebellious heart) elevate themes of fractured identity; ending feels thematically resonant but lacks narrative tension payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in blending sci-fi and mystical elements; some phrases ("whispers of the past") border on overused imagery but balance with original concept combinations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements synergize thematically but feel occasionally checklist-driven; emotional afterimage exists but lacks narrative propulsion sufficient for prestigious publication standards.</comment>
