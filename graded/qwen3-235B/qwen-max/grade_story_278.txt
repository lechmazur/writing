<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Surface-level brooding with vague artistic past; motivation to escape is clear but actions feel under-explained. Vintage glasses serve minimal purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but rushes key developments. Disappearances lack satisfying buildup; ending feels abrupt despite neat circularity with the sunbeam framing device.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on vague descriptors (dust motes, metallic surfaces) without immersive sensory depth. Setting never fully evolves beyond generic sci-fi tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (dust as freedom) and coordinates-as-escape are functional but predictable. Themes of creative repression lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Relies on AI-friendly clich√©s (mysterious scientists, cryptic coordinates). Overly polished descriptions ("murky tenderness") lack lived-in authenticity. Emotional arcs feel checklist-driven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently integrated. Some forced uses (dust-dance method), while the base setting and escape motif hint at creative potential left unexplored in the word limit.</comment>
