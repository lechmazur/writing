<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation (transcending immortality's curse) is clear but lacks emotional depth. The eternal student archetype feels underexploited, and the detached devotion tone clashes with the transformative action of digitizing himself. The headlamp as a symbolic object is well-used but doesn't fully reveal character nuances.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels compressed. The journals' discovery drives the transformation logically, and the ending provides philosophical closure. However, the digitization process is under-explained, and the pivotal moment lacks emotional buildup, making the sacrifice feel rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cinematic atmosphere with damp stone walls and failing headlamp creates visceral immersion, but the mole people's underground city is superficially described. The setting effectively evokes claustrophobia but doesn't fully integrate with the cosmic themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (headlamp as fragile humanity, journals as consciousness bridges) and resonant ending elevate the story. The subtext about immortality as perpetual captivity is compelling, but emotional engagement is limited by the protagonist's emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by combining immortality with digital transcendence. No overt purple prose, but some phrases ("cosmic loneliness," "infinite possibilities") verge on abstraction. The premise feels human-authored but lacks the psychological complexity to fully realize its ambitious themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cleverly interweaves most assigned elements (headlamp, journals, immortality) into a cohesive narrative. The mole people and starless timeframe feel extraneous, but the story maintains coherence within constraints and leaves lingering questions about the nature of freedom.</comment>
