<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has surface-level distinctiveness but motivations lack nuance; "impulsively thoughtful" remains underdeveloped, and emotional stakes feel partially abstract rather than rooted in concrete behavior or lived-in psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints but relies on compressed exposition; the charcoal's symbolic role drives action but transitions between memory and invention lack sufficient tension to sustain the compressed arc's urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting immerses through tactile decay (rusted equipment, algae) and thematic resonance ("fractured grace"), though the "social upheaval" timeframe remains superficially sketched rather than integrated into the environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents and layered metaphors (charcoal as power/renewal) elevate impact; dialogue is purposeful, but some thematic subtlety is undercut by occasional overt explanation ("trust reclaimed").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through evocative specifics (e.g., algae-lit lab) but falters in over-formalized descriptions ("fractured grace," "fleeting hope") that border on poetic abstraction without deeper emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted; the underwater setting and charcoal are compelling, while "social upheaval" feels tacked on. The ending resonates but leaves thematic threads under-explored.</comment>
