<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains static; motivations tied to the shard are clear but underexplored. The trait of "loving detachment" is inconsistently manifested—more told than shown through actions. Reaction to the pottery reveals sorrow but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves closure through the mosaic ritual but feels compressed. The action (reassembling scraps) drives the story, but cause/effect between the vow and the weavers’ intervention lacks nuance. Pacing drags slightly in worldbuilding before reaching emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Neon-lit futuristic city contrasts effectively with the dim recycling center, enhancing mood. Sensory details (hissing machines, mismatched threads) create immersion, but the setting’s potential to mirror the character’s emotional state (e.g., waste vs. rebirth) is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (shard融入 mosaic) evokes themes of collective memory and healing. The ending resonates emotionally, but subtext about communal meaning vs. individual grief is thinly developed. Dialogues hint at philosophical weight without full realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Secret weavers and oceanic pottery offer originality, but the "detached swordsman" trope leans on genre clichés. Prose avoids purple patches but occasionally defaults to familiar phrases ("danced across glass towers"). Nuanced emotion is implied rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels engineered by plot contrivance (e.g., weavers’ timely presence). Elements serve the theme but lack organic integration. The closing moment achieves poetic resonance, yet the story’s brevity leaves thematic layers underdeveloped.</comment>
