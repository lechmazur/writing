<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to map sacred flows is clear but lacks nuanced psychological depth; her symbolic role overshadows personal specificity despite consistent actions tied to assigned traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear arc from disconnection to epiphany, but minimal conflict and resolution feel more thematic than dramatic; pacing manages time constraint reasonably well.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive, poetic atmosphere with vivid bonsai/mountain contrasts, though some descriptions verge on overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor (e.g., confession-to-path mapping) and resonant thematic closure; prose occasionally teeters between lyrical and pretentious, slightly undermining impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but skates close to "mystical female intuition" clichés; inventive combination of elements counters minor overuse of adjectives and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent and thematically unified but uneven in execution—strongest in atmosphere and metaphor, weaker in character complexity; polished but not groundbreaking.</comment>
