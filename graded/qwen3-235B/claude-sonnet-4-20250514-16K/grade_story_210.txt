<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; Elena's "amiable" trait remains abstract, shown primarily through passive receptivity rather than action; limited emotional nuance in her reactions to supernatural phenomena; distinct scholarly voice present but lacks idiosyncratic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent arc from scholarly pursuit to revelation, but pacing relies too heavily on exposition; the crossword-to-code device drives the plot but feels slightly contrived; abrupt transition from vibration to "carved initials" stretches logical flow; ending feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory integration of maritime decay—creaking timbers, shadow patterns, tactile resonance—creates immersive atmosphere; lighthouse-as-collective-memorial concept powerfully realized through specific details like 17 shipwrecks; setting drives conceptual themes of memory and preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric use of crossword as translation device; emotionally resonant throughline about marginalization of oral history; climax feels intellectual rather than visceral; symbolism could have more subtextual complexity; ending lacks lingering ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some AI-esque phrasing ("whispered fragments," "storm's memories") weakens authenticity; originality constrained by familiar haunted-artifact tropes; occasional purple prose ("harmony of seventeen ships") undermines realism; emotional engagement primarily conceptual rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of core elements, though "waiting until good news arrives" timeframe feels awkwardly imposed; stylistic choices serve theme but lack distinctive authorial voice; briefness amplifies mystical aspects while compressing emotional development.</comment>
