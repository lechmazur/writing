<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is emotionally resonant but underdeveloped; the woodsman persona lacks depth in how it shapes actions, while the hairbrush symbolism reveals trauma but could better integrate with his identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong in arc progression but strained by time compression; the short-circuiting equipment feels contrived in triggering the emotional climax, disrupting cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting delivers visceral sensory details (sparks, metallic acoustics), but the radio wave garden’s thematic connection to "forgotten" vs. "measurable" remains underexplored beyond aesthetic function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance via metaphor (echoes as unspoken grief) and subtext; the ending risks slight sentimentality but earns authenticity through embodied sensory language rather than explicit emotional cues.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Echo-measurement motif feels human-organic but strains in spots (e.g., "artfully messy" teeters toward aestheticized desolation tropes); avoids overt cliché through technical specificity grounding the metaphoric framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through central metaphor but unevenly integrates character history; brevity works for psychological revelation but undermines environmental context development.</comment>
