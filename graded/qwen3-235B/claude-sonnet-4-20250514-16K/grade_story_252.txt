<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but underdeveloped; her penance feels abrupt rather than earned, though the toy block effectively reveals inner conflict through tactile memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a redemption arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but the tight word limit creates narrative compression that weakens emotional payoff; cause-effect from memory restoration to reality repair is logical but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through preserved peaches' amber light, cherry blossom leak traces, and tactile descriptions of the toy block; the vault's purpose as memory prison harmonizes with preservation magic, though swing set hush feels narratively underweighted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory-as-frozen-ice metaphor and bittersweet ending produce strong emotional resonance; layered subtext about ethical boundaries of memory manipulation elevates the concept beyond surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("lovingly hateful") compete with occasionally overwrought phrasing ("icy warmth of redemption"); avoids typical AI tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction that dilutes visceral impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically around memory preservation/restoration but occasionally prioritize poetic imagery over narrative clarity; the short form feels intentional in creating elliptical tension between theft and repair.</comment>
