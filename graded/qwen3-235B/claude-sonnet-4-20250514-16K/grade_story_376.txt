<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes; client's motivation is clear but Mira's deeper rationale feels underdeveloped. Interactions reveal little about Mira beyond her professional role as an observer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some overly wrought descriptions ("amber-preserved wisdom") and anachronistic juxtapositions feel curated rather than organic. Emotional subtext is shown effectively but occasionally undercut by thematic overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere transcends gimmicks, yet the story risks becoming a showcase for aesthetic juxtapositions rather than a fully realized narrative. Lingering impression comes from mood more than mechanics.</comment>
