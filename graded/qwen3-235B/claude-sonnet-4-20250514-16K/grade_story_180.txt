<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's remorse and motivation drive action; surface-level nuance in his internal conflict but lacks deeper psychological exploration; inconsistent tonal shifts in "indifferent enthusiasm" portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc constrained by word limit; pacing falters in establishing setting's significance; connection between yard-sale ritual and resolution feels compressed; cause-effect logic for magic dampening is underexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Shipwrecks/decaying greenhouse create hauntingly specific atmosphere; sensory details about brass fingerprints and "fruit that had never existed" evoke otherworldliness; surreal cohesion slightly undermined by unresolved symbolic tension between decay and rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (magic as unruly inheritance); avoids explicit emotion declarations; closing image of "sacred landscape" elevates thematic sophistication; prose rhythm occasionally falters under over-adjectivized descriptions like "wild frontier."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in merging domestic objects with mystical significance; resists fantasy clich√©s through intimate scale; "practiced disinterest" phrasing borders on formulaic; emotional beats revealed through physicality (warm knitting needle) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic symmetry but strain narrative realism (microscope fingerprint DNA logic); prose density occasionally obscures clarity; conceptual tightness balanced against slight artificiality in plot mechanics.</comment>
