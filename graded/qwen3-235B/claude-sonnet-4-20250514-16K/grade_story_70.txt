<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Transformation feels rushed; reactions lack nuance. Motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through layered actions. "Certainly uncertain" fingers don't fully manifest in consistent behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on sudden epiphanies rather than organic development. Tight word limit strains pacing of revelation. Connection between adhesive analysis and soul-illuminating bulb lacks sufficient groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally atmospheric with rich texture - greenhouse gravestones create haunting juxtaposition of decay/innovation. Sensory details like moss-slicked steps and whispering plants create immersive physicality and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("mechanical heart beating organic rhythm") elevates theme of science/empathy synthesis. Ending feels slightly didactic rather than earned. Subtext about emotional conductivity in scientific discovery warrants deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Descriptions verge on purple prose with excessive metaphoric layering. Phrases like "dust of old certainties" feel formulaic. Emotional shifts told more than shown through metaphor overload rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated. Transformation concept feels more thematic imposition than organic evolution. Story contains memorable fragments but cohesion compromised by ambitious thematic layering exceeding word constraints.</comment>
