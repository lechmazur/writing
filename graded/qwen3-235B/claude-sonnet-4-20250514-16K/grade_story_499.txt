<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her transformation from complicit ghostwriter to whistleblower lacks emotional depth, relying on backstory hints rather than fully realized internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The plot moves efficiently but feels rushed in key moments—Blackwood's villainy is revealed through "coded stanzas" with minimal evidence of Marina's decoding process, weakening cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground orchard's eerie fungal glow and biotech money-laundering create hauntingly original atmosphere; however, the chaotic orchestra is underutilized as thematic counterpoint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Poetic imagery elevates the prose, but emotional resonance is undercut by heavy-handed metaphors ("fungal spores blessing her decision"); the ending's triumph feels rushed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés with unique elements like bio-engineered orchard corruption, but occasionally slips into overly ornate descriptions ("poetically rational mind calculating timing") that strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story impresses through sensory originality but suffers from overreaching ambition in its tight word count; themes of identity and corruption resonate, but execution feels strained at times.</comment>
