<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (academic obsession transforming into mission), but psychological depth remains superficial; actions align with assigned traits yet lack nuanced human contradiction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves methodically despite tight constraints, but the shift from temple inscriptions to plague remedies feels slightly forced; cause/effect connections work within the fantastical framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details (cold espresso, corroded metal, pre-dawn light), though deeper integration of digital nomad setting with ancient mystery could enhance cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (coffee as cartographic metaphor), resonant theme of preservation through subterfuge, and layered subtext about knowledge as both treasure and cure create lasting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tendencies but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing; emotional resonance is more implied than embodied, with some repetitive descriptors ("bleary-eyed," "dire enchantment").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically despite packed elements; some assigned components (coffee pattern method) strain credibility, but the fusion of piracy and medicine offers compelling philosophical questions about knowledge preservation.</comment>
