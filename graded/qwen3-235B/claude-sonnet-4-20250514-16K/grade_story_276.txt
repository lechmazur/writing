<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is present but lacks depth in how Maya's past trauma shapes her actions; her role as an emissary remains underdeveloped despite influencing her isolation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent with clear progression from isolation to revelation, though the tight word limit strains the integration of the timeframe element; cause/effect is logical and pivotal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mood is contemplative, but sensory details are sporadic; coathanger and postcards evoke the setting's purpose, yet the observation deck's atmosphere is underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance between debris and human experience; ending evokes thematic cohesion, though some sentimental phrasing risks mawkishness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structure; metaphors (postcards as data, coathanger as redemption) feel fresh, though occasional ornate phrasing slightly detracts from emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Solid thematic cohesion; brevity enhances focus on pivotal moments, but minor elements (picnics, emissary role) slightly dilute narrative focus.</comment>
