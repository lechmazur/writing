<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maya's "seer" trait lacks depth beyond exposition; her vengeance motive is clear but underexplored emotionally. The "innocent" facade contrasts effectively with her competence, though her internal conflict remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight arc: retrieval-decryption-distribution. Pacing is efficient, though the rain-based decryption mechanism feels underexplained. Connection between rain and data decryption strains logic slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Intertwining of post-party detritus with storm atmosphere creates striking visuals. Rain's sensory details particularly potent. The abandoned tower's decay could have been more integrated with character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (rain as decryption key, data as "hieroglyphs") elevate beyond procedural. Subtext about systemic corruption and vengeance remains potent without explicit moralizing. Ending pays off cyclical justice theme effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids spy-thriller tropes through mystical realism blend. Characterization avoids algorithmic shortcuts through specific details (e.g., parents' death via American-made bombs). Some phrasing edges toward melodrama but generally controlled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements feel organically intertwined rather than checklist-style placements. Short length emphasizes precision over omission. The fusion of technological crime with ancestral perception lingers as provocative concept.</comment>
