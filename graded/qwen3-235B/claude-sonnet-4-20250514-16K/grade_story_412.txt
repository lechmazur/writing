<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's dual role as bookish assassin and geographically challenged agent influences plot, but internal conflict lacks nuanced progression; transformation from killer to protector feels abrupt without deeper exploration of scholarly/killer duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves clear arc (hunting → protecting) within constraints; cyclical nightmares driving transformation work narratively but lack psychological texture; ending ties back to object (key cover) effectively but feels slightly schematic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines cold tech (frequency station) with emotional weight (nightmares), but sensory details remain generic; the librarian’s death lacks visceral impact; tone oscillates between noir abstraction and ideological earnestness without full synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story delivers emotional punch through thematic paradox (knowledge as destruction/creation); metaphor of "rubber key cover" and "coordinates" as narrative devices work well; some ideas (e.g., "truth uncontainable") lean on grandiose phrasing rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Writing avoids overt cliché but occasionally slips into didacticism ("truth should flow freely"); nightmares as transformative device feel conventional; emotional shifts rely partially on explicit statements rather than fully embodied through action/description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual coherence fluctuates—elements (e.g., geographical disorientation, cyclical dreams) feel both organic and imposed; brevity serves thematic clarity but sacrifices character depth; lingering resonance lies more in idea (knowledge ethics) than lived experience.</comment>
