<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Minerva's internal shift from solitude to community is evident but underdeveloped. The black rose symbolizes her isolation effectively, but her interactions lack nuanced motivation shifts. The transformation feels rushed, with character reactions leaning more on dialogue than emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear three-part structure, but emotional transitions are too smooth. Board games as a method lack specific incidents driving Minerva's change, weakening cause/effect logic. Pacing is efficient but doesn’t allow deeper exploration of her internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like crystalline walls and oversized tea bowls create atmosphere, but the frost giant's lair exists more as backdrop than thematic catalyst. The setting’s whimsy enriches imagery but doesn’t fully intertwine with Minerva’s internal journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of solitude vs. connection are clear but told rather than shown. Effective use of symbolism (black rose) and playful irony (frost giant’s tea), but lacks subtext and deeper exploration of emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Board game nights in a giant’s lair offer originality, but the "solitary scholar finds community" arc is predictable. Some phrases ("alpha predator called despair") risk cliché, while dialogue remains natural but underexplored for character depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds as a lightweight vignette—cohesive, creative, and competently written. However, the protagonist’s arc lacks the emotional depth and thematic innovation needed for lasting impact, feeling more like a moment than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
