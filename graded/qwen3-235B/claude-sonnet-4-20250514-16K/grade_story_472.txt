<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has poetic depth but lacks psychological complexity; motivations are conceptually coherent but emotionally abstract, relying heavily on symbolic presentation over nuanced human reaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conceptual trajectory moves effectively from pursuit to revelation but feels compressed; pacing works for thematic epiphany rather than emotional payoff, with slight unevenness in transitions between contemplative spaces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with precise details (zero-gravity books, starlit buttons) creates convincing otherworldly atmosphere; the floating library's mechanics and metaphysical properties feel organically integrated with the story's philosophical core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional symbolic layering (button as legacy, flag as communication) with lyrical prose that builds to a resonant conclusion; emotional undercurrents could be more viscerally felt rather than intellectually conceived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original approach to cosmic mystery through absence rather than presence shows ingenuity; occasional flourishes ("cosmic dust") teeter toward familiar poeticisms, but the flag-as-language concept genuinely surprises and subverts sci-fi communication tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>High-concept elements work in service of theme rather than arbitrary decoration; the ending's emotional weight hinges on successful synthesis of silence-as-communication logic, which feels earned rather than formulaic despite its brevity.</comment>
