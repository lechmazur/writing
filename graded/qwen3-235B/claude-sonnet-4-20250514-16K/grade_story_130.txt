<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character has consistent voice and self-awareness, but lacks complex motivation beyond broad themes of self-acceptance. Growth feels narratively imposed rather than organically revealed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tight word count creates artificial progression - emotional evolution feels truncated, yet the nested structure of nest/phone/messages provides clever scaffolding for limited space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting descriptions are vivid but decorative rather than integral. The ship's unique qualities don't organically drive character decisions or thematic revelations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphorical throughlines (nest-building, intercepted transmissions) but occasionally leans on declarative statements rather than deeper exploration of ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with space-bound orchard concept, but some phrasing ("seeds of understanding," "emotional topology") dips into familiar literary patterns without deep reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Successfully merges assigned elements into cohesive whole with lingering thematic resonance, though certain components (cordless phone's galactic functionality) strain plausibility.</comment>
