<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Chen's diplomatic precision is shown through controlled gestures and dialogue, but her internal conflict remains surface-level despite tragic backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression from retrieval to revelation works, but the reversal from revenge to redemption feels abrupt within constraints. Genetic data decoding lacks technical logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Visually atmospheric but inconsistently immersive - drum circles and bioengineered fur create dissonance rather than cohesion; velvet rot/must scent underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Twisted irony of healing through vengeance works emotionally, but metaphors remain literal; could have more subtext about scientific ethics vs. maternal grief.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some stilted phrases ("theater of the absurd") and stated emotions; fresh twist on revenge trope undercut by predictable redemption arc and overused "haunted by past" framework.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements strain coherence - genetic data in fur borders on magical thinking; atmosphere compelling but narrative relies on coincidence; lingering thought about ethics survives limitations.</comment>
