<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's seasickness and charm remain surface traits; motivations to confront mirror lack emotional depth despite lunar tracking. Actions resolve logically but lack visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot flows clearly but feels compressed; moon-phase tracking and mirror confrontation lack causal momentum. Resolution satisfies thematically but pacing feels rushed in key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid, dreamlike sensory details in crystal fortress and canyon enhance mood. Atmosphere aligns with thematic longing but worldbuilding feels more decorative than integral to stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror as deception collector) and imagery (shattering glass) resonate. Ending subverts expectations but underplays emotional payoff. Writing skillfully balances poetic language with narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some striking reframing (mirrors as liars) but struggles with AI-typical oververbalization ("centuries of quiet longing") and predictable structure (hero defeats magical system via cleverness).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration varies â€“ ghost orchid bulb and mirror concept are essential; moon-phase tracking feels imposed. Ending lingers but tonal cohesion occasionally fractures under ornate prose.</comment>
