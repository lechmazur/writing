<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Marcus's vigilance from his orchardist background ties into his attention to patterns, providing consistency in his motivation and actions. His sardonic voice adds distinction, though his revenge-driven arc could use more introspective nuance for full three-dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment> The plot's tight structure within the word limit balances setup, discovery, and resolution effectively. The causal link between Marcus's observation and the conspiracy revelation is logical, though the corporate lockdown sequence feels slightly rushed, slightly straining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment> The paper airplane facility's sterile atmosphere contrasts with Marcus's personal history, enhancing thematic resonance. The seal's physicality and peacock imagery are well-integrated, but atmospheric details like sensory descriptions of the facility or his former orchard could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment> The story's use of the peacock's tail as both symbol and inciting device creates layered meaning, with Marcus's grandmother's wisdom resonating thematically. The dialogue-driven reveal avoids exposition, and the ending balances closure with lingering implications of broader impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment> The prose avoids formulaic structures, blending precise imagery ("bronze peacock") with thematic subtext. Emotions are shown through actions and objects rather than stated, and the sardonic tone remains consistent without veering into caricature. The twist feels inventive, not algorithmically predictable.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment> The story cohesively integrates its assigned elements to serve character and plot, with the peacock imagery and facility setting particularly effective. The brevity feels intentional, and the ending provokes reflection on patterns of power and resistance, though the internâ€™s confusion lacks development.</comment>
