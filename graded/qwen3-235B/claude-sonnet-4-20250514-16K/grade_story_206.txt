<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are vividly sketched but lack nuanced psychological complexity; vendetta motivation is clear but underexplored beyond surface revenge, missing deeper emotional resonance in personal loss.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc with logical cause-effect chains, but climax resolution feels compressed; photograph trail drives action effectively but deserves more narrative space within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses specific details (molten sugar, thunderous boots, market sounds) well but remains surface-level; war setting's political ramifications and market uniqueness could use richer contextual integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of sugary artistry vs. destruction creates memorable tension; the locket as a symbol of legacy and betrayal elevates the narrative beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional clich√©d phrases ("salt air", "ardent scorn"); emotional beats often shown through actions but occasionally flattened by explicit declarations of feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist cohesively but not innovatively; photographs/locket integration feels organic while the candy sculptor profession works more as thematic device than narrative necessity.</comment>
