<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear but emotional arcs feel compressed; her transformation from "unknowing heir" to inheritor lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from discovery to resolution but feels rushed; the "trivially monumental" reveal about her legacy arrives without sufficient buildup, leaving the arc undernourished.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory details (flickering light, metallic sweetness) but the magnetic mountain’s vague connection to the theater’s preservations weakens plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical cohesion (spoon as tool/symbol, projector as "mechanical heartbeat") and thematic resonance about storytelling elevate the emotional impact, though some phrases lean on clichés ("delightful uncertainty").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in linking tactile discovery (peeling paint) to ancestral revelation is undercut by predictable tropes of inherited destiny; "frolicsome regret" feels underexplored as a tonal choice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>While the story’s core theme—legacy as both burden and liberation—is compelling, uneven integration of elements (e.g., magnetic mountain’s loose logic) hampers cohesion and memorability.</grade>
