<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's weariness and existential discontent are established but remain abstract; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance; introspection feels symbolic rather than emotionally authentic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves from literal/figurative fragmentation to self-acceptance through atmospheric shifts, but emotional arc relies on poetic abstraction rather than concrete character actions; pacing slows for lyrical passages at expense of narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral, layered sensory details (weatherworn textures, chromatic light, percussive soundscapes) create immersive decay; setting itself functions as metaphysical extension of character's fracturing psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (mirrors as identity multiplicities, glass as alchemy of self) resonates emotionally through accumulation rather than explicit declaration; ending balances transcendence and restraint, though "I love you" borders on sentimental overreach.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages border on precious ("hammered repose," "cradle of sparks"), but overall avoids clich√© through inventive juxtapositions (e.g., "intentionally accidental percussion"); emotional undercurrents feel genuine despite occasional ornamental language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Element integration is thematically coherent (abandoned spaces, fractured identities) with economy befitting word count; the final revelation emerges organically from symbolic scaffolding rather than feeling forced.</comment>
