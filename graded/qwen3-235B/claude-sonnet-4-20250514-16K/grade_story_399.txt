<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (trauma as both burden and teacher) is clear and thematically integrated, but emotional nuance feels somewhat surface-level; his grumpiness is more of an aesthetic than a psychologically complex trait, though the archival focus on memory hints at deeper layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent emotional arc (burden → revelation → acceptance), but the 400-500 word constraint strains the pacing—trauma unpacking feels rushed despite poetic compression. The "uprising within" resolves predictably without fully earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere (crystal formations, shifting mandala) immerses effectively, though some descriptors ("grandiose subtlety," "multiply singular") verge on pretentious abstraction. The obsidian windows and stargazing framework create a haunting, timeless mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (sand patterns as trauma's dual-nature, trauma-as-sculptor) elevate the narrative. The ending avoids trite resolution, reframing Erasmus' existence as purposeful rather than punitive. Subtext about memory as a sacred act lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally lapses into familiar phrasing ("fragments of the soul," "strength hidden in the human spirit"). Character psychology leans into archetypes (haunted gravedigger, cryptic witch) more than idiosyncratic depth, but the mandala's logic-driven healing mechanism feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story coherently synthesizes assigned elements without obvious seams; each component (sand patterns, trauma, stargazing) serves the theme. The brevity enhances resonance through implication, though the final transformation risks feeling overly neat rather than deeply earned.</comment>
