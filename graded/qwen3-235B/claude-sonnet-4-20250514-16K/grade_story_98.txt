<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness drives the transformation arc, but internal conflict lacks sufficient nuance. Motivation is clear but motivation-to-reaction causality feels slightly schematic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot's three-part structure functions within constraints, though revelation's pacing feels slightly rushed. The ruler's role in dismantling the illusion is logical but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere effectively contrasts mundane warehouse elements, but sensory details (flickering candles, footsteps) feel borrowed rather than freshly observed. Chamber's physicality remains underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Awards intentional avoidance of secret society clich√©s through subversive resolution. The ruler's banality as central symbol avoids formulaic treatment, while atmospheric elements occasionally flirt with Gothic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces into thematically satisfying whole despite minor pacing hiccups. The juxtaposition of scholarly quest with ordinary dog walkers' lives creates lingering philosophical resonance within word count constraints.</comment>
