<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (Joaquín's sacred duty, María's confession) are consistent but thinly developed; the "diligently whimsical" trait manifests visually but doesn't drive significant plot action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc but relies heavily on convenient narrative leaps (spirit barrier collapsing instantly post-confession); pacing balances setup and resolution but lacks escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (copal scent, shimmering headdresses) create a vivid liminal space; the juxtaposition of ancient and modern elements is atmospheric but sometimes superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolism (magnifying glass as interdimensional bridge) are effective; the theme of cultural preservation through ritual has emotional resonance, though the ending feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on familiar haunting tropes; language oscillates between lyrical precision ("feathered headdresses shimmering like heat mirages") and mild abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel curated rather than organic; the compact form serves the narrative economy, though some connections merit deeper exploration to justify high-concept stakes.</comment>
