<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has crisp self-awareness but lacks interiority beyond performative absurdity; relies heavily on eccentric diction to convey depth without substantial emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coherent but static throughline; pendulum motif provides structure but narrative progression remains atmospheric rather than character-driven, weakening arc resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in abstract mood (void's silence vs. mechanical sounds), but connects superficially with character psychology and thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subtly devastating irony in using quantification to explore existential meaninglessness; the juxtaposition of pseudo-scientific jargon with poetic futility creates genuine thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional reliance on whimsical clich√©s; pendulum rhythm and "cosmic irony" metrics feel conceptually repetitive rather than imaginatively expansive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but lack unified emotional or philosophical intensity; the resolution cleverly recontextualizes "meaningless" as authentic but lacks lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
