<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt and redemption arc is palpable, but motivations occasionally feel implied rather than fully embodied through nuanced behavior. The tremors as a physical manifestation of inner turmoil work well, though the "carefully reckless" trait lacks deeper integration with action choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a strong emotional through-line and satisfying resolution, but the "improbable rumor chains" feel underdeveloped as a driving mechanism. The tight word limit strains cause/effect transitions slightly, though the cathedral's spatial progression works effectively. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory immediacy (paint/incense, shattered glass light), though the cathedral's transformation from ruin to artist sanctuary feels conceptually underexplored. Timeframe and setting work synergistically but require reader extrapolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and subtext elevates the narrative. The amber-spider symbolism's evolution and silence-to-dialing payoff create lasting resonance. Emotional beats are shown rather than told, with the final gesture feeling earned rather than sentimentalized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through specific imagery and emotional authenticity, though "shaky mercenary seeking redemption" framework remains somewhat familiar. The "carefully reckless" phrasing occasionally borders on conceptual labeling rather than lived characterization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven with theme and characterâ€”each assigned detail contributes to the central metaphor or emotional arc. The brevity serves the narrative's elegiac quality, though certain connections (rumor mechanics) could feel more organically earned.</comment>
