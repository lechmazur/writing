<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (loneliness, exile) are clear but transformation feels under-justified. Dialogue lacks distinct voice, reducing emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but relies on contrived chance. Storm-driven encounter resolves conflict too conveniently within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective sensory contrast between decaying customs office and storm, but some generic descriptions weaken immersive impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (storm/resolution) work, but overt thematic exposition weakens deeper resonance. Dialogue edges on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original setting but predictable character archetypes. "Unseen forces" remain vague; some overly elaborate phrasing undermines clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Functional thematic unity with atmospheric strength, but uneven character psychology and exposition-heavy resolution limit publishability.</comment>
