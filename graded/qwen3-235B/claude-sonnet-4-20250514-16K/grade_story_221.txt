<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marina’s internal conflict is vividly rendered through precise symbols (amber, letter) and sensory details, but her voice occasionally veers toward generic melancholy despite strong emotional arcs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of rebellion-illumination-decision, but the word limit compresses pivotal moments (e.g., amber’s awakening of the ghosts) into abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dilapidated carnival’s decay mirrors Marina’s stifled spirit; sensory details (moonlight through broken roofs, pulsing amber) create a haunting, layered atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (amber as metamorphosis, thawing heart) elevates the theme beyond rebellion. The ending resonates as earned rather than sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through fresh metaphors (e.g., “heart calcified like barnacles”) but occasionally leans on overwrought phrases (“joyfully melancholic moment”) that slightly undermine nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The elements synergize into a cohesive exploration of self-liberation; the brevity amplifies Marina’s emotional clarity, though some connections (carnival’s historical ties) remain underexplored.</comment>
