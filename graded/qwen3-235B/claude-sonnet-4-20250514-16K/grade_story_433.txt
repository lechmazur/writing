<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fragments of internal conflict emerge through Mira's interaction with the prophecy, but her transformation feels underdeveloped within the limited scope. The character's hardheadedness manifests too abruptly in her final decision without sufficient psychological groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing stumbles under word constraints: the gallery's ephemeral nature remains superficial, the discovery of prophecies lacks build-up, and the redemption arc compresses too hastily between prophecy fragments and the storm confrontation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The snow-drenched setting creates a hauntingly appropriate atmosphere, with sensory details like frost-etched windows and indifferent snowfall effectively reinforcing thematic contrasts between fragility and endurance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (power severing threads to nature) elevate the narrative, though emotional impact is diluted by occasionally didactic phrasing. The ending achieves thematic resonance but falls short of visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some evocative phrasing clashes with predictable tropes ("endless snow days," "wholeness through losing everything"). The balance between lyrical language and human nuance remains uneven, bordering on self-consciously poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conceptual framework holds together cohesively but lacks the transcendence that would make it memorable. Assigned elements serve their narrative functions without fully coalescing into something greater than the sum of its parts.</comment>
