<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar dystopian tropes (corrupt director, corporate malfeasance); psychological complexity elevates it above formulaic execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements integrate adequately, but "timely rebirth" and "serendipitously stubborn" feel imposed; tone remains consistent despite constraints.</comment>
