<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is somewhat abstract; Caspian's contradictions are stated rather than deeply dramatized, relying on thematic declarations over psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically within constraints, using cyclical erasure to reinforce theme, though the resolution feels more ambient than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sound garden's sensory textures (metallic whispers, wind-catchers) create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere that deepens character and concept.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally succumbs to overly poetic phrasing and generalized rebelliousness rather than piercing individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates assigned elements with thematic purpose; the chalk messages' destruction and recreation offers a compelling metaphor for ideological struggle.</comment>
