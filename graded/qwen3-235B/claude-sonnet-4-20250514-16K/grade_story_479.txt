<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character acts as a vessel for themes rather than possessing layered complexity. Motivations are clear but surface-level, with emotional reactions stated rather than revealed through subtext.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight pacing with a functional arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. Logical progression disrupted by overly rapid emotional shifts in the final scene.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create atmosphere, but the fusion of modern digital archives with gothic funerary traditions lacks cohesive tonal unification.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance through symbolism (measuring tape as existential bridge) and lyrical imagery, but emotional impact is diminished by predictable metaphysical disclosures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Linguistic flourishes occasionally veer into pretension ("cerulean paint swirled in the mason jar"), while the fusion of Victorian occultism with internet forums shows inventive potential without fully escaping genre echoes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Competently economical with limited word count; elements function together but lack transformative cohesion that would make constraints feel deliberately artistic rather than circumstantial.</comment>
