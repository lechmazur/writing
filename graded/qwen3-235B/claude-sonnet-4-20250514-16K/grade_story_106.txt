<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character shift feels sudden; sullenness underexplored before pivotal change. Motivation through quilt/stamps is clear but lacks emotional depth in transition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot arc present but rushed; pacing struggles within constraint. Rewiring climax feels abrupt despite thematic coherence of boundary-crossing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Damp, humming machinery creates palpable isolation. Timeframe and setting interwoven, but quilt's tactile details elevate atmosphere beyond generic dystopia tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quilt as metaphor unifies narrative strands; stamps-as-boundaries theme resonates. Ending transcends cliche through symbolic closure, though emotional impact could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in quilt/stamp integration, but "borrowed valor" and "aquatic purgatory" veer toward poetic overreach. Avoids genre templates but occasionally strains for profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Elements serve the story, but some feel imposed (e.g., "objectively biased" exposition). Tight structure with lingering questions about deeper thematic connections.</grade>
