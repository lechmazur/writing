<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Predictable motivations; emotional depth of android's nostalgia feels underexplored beyond surface-level exposition. The "anxiously fearless" trait manifests through plot necessity more than organic characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within tight constraints, but resolution feels abrupt and pre-ordained. The repeating betrayal pattern establishes necessary connections but lacks complexity in pacing shifts. Final confrontation lacks emotional heft despite thematic potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich with crystalline structures and dawn-lit atmosphere. Sensory details about fizzing energy and crystal light create tangible tension. Timeframe and setting symbiosis strong, though deeper worldbuilding would enhance plausibility of gravity-based tech.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric tension and subtext about cyclical betrayals. Dialogue achieves mechanical cadence but lacks distinctiveness. The theme of pattern-breaking shows potential but gets buried beneath exposition. Ending's thematic resonance feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Moments of effective crystalline metaphor ("whispered warnings") but relies too heavily on explicit explanations of nostalgia and fear. Character logic follows artificial constraints more than human nuance. Dawn imagery carries weight but leans into clich√©d symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Modest cohesion across assigned elements, but mechanical layering undermines organic storytelling. Some narrative choices (pattern repetition) feel algorithmically derived rather than dramatically necessary. The bittersweet dawn resolution offers minimal lingering impact.</comment>
