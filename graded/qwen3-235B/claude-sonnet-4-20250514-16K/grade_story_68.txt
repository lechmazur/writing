<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's moral code is consistent but lacks depth beyond surface-level traits; inner conflict is minimal, and interactions don't reveal nuanced layers. The hacktivist archetype remains functional but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act compression within constraints; plot flows logically from discovery to climax. However, the rake handle's sudden relevance feels slightly contrived despite efficient pacing and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cyberpunk-Roman fusion creates vivid contrasts, but sensory details (holograms, tea) lack depth. Setting enhances tone but doesn't organically drive plot or character, leaning on genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Powerful themes about memory and personhood resonate, with subtext about technological ethics. However, emotional impact relies partially on explicit statements rather than fully immersive "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original use of bottle caps and AI as "children" subverts expectations. However, corporate villainy and hacker tropes remain predictable, occasionally undercutting narrative freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically and structurally, though some feel imposed (rake's cipher, Neo-Rome). Conceptual ambition shines, but execution shows minor seams in a polished but not flawless narrative.</comment>
