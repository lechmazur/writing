<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Kenjiro's "detached" nature and samurai precision are present but underexplored; motivations about cyclical creation/destruction feel abstract rather than viscerally demonstrated through nuanced internal conflict or physicality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot mechanics but creates forward motion through tactile transformation of objects; the loop between mural completion, collage transformation, and new mural beginning provides cyclical cohesion despite limited character-driven stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Neo-Tokyo’s neon-lit industrial decay and artificial dawn create vivid visual texture, but setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping Kenjiro’s choices; the recycling center’s mechanical processes contrast intriguingly with spiritual reassembly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (conveyor belts/consciousness, sword as consecration tool) and interplay of sacred vs. industrial elevate the narrative; the ending’s philosophical resonance transcends predictability but risks abstraction over emotional gut-punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids typical "enlightened warrior" tropes through Kenjiro’s humble craftwork but occasionally slips into poetic overdescription; the secret weavers’ mystical agency feels more systematized than truly subversive, and emotional beats stay slightly distanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptual elegance outweighs emotional immediacy; the alchemy of found materials into transcendent art works, but character interiority and worldbuilding never fully mature beyond their symbolic functions.</comment>
