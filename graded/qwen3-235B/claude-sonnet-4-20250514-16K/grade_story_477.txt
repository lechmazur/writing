<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is minimally developed; motivation to escape conformity is clear but lacks psychological depth. Physical grace in action dominates over emotional nuance, leaving the swordsman archetype underexplored beyond surface tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear escape arc but suffers from rushed logic (e.g., sudden activation of security protocols). Causal chain between innovation and consequences feels underdeveloped within the constrained space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through specific sensory details (kelp-filtered light, coral-fragment tech) that make the setting a protagonist in itself. Environmental storytelling strongly reinforces theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses symbolic parallels (broken TVs as cosmic portals, bird songs as resistance) to elevate concept beyond plot. Ending resonates with thematic closure, though emotional impact remains somewhat muted by narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s through surreal combinations (neural inhibitors, linguistic processors in ruins) and subtext about artifice vs. authenticity. Some descriptive passages feel strained ("mindfully scattered") but overall maintains original voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Despite high-concept density, elements cohere through recurring motifs of brokenness/reconstruction. Storytelling discipline maintains momentum; the ending's poetic resonance suggests thematic heft exceeding surface plot.</comment>
