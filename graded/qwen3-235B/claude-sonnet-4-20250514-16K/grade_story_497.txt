<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; the daydreaming attribute drives the action superficially but doesn't create psychological depth or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the method of carving symbols connects to the setting but lacks technical specificity, making the "coded scuff marks" concept underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, otherworldly atmosphere with vivid aquatic imagery; the submerged palace's cursed nature and glacial timeframe create hauntingly sustained tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism of compassion's persistence through ice engravings; surface thematic clarity is strong, but emotional impact suffers from occasionally overt message delivery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in merging scientific elements (satellite fragment) with poetic symbolism; some ornate phrasing ("pristine chaos") borders on pretension but doesn't overwhelm the narrative voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Most elements integrate well with the concept but occasionally strain believability; the tight word limit reveals slight structural seams between atmospheric description and thematic ambition.</comment>
