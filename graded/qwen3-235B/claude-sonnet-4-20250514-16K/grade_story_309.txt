<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character displays methodical determination and sarcasm effectively, but motivation remains surface-level obsession without deeper psychological complexity; reactions to the kaleidoscope's revelations lack visceral emotional nuance despite high-stakes context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Non-linear memory revelations through kaleidoscope create satisfying plot propulsion; tight cause-effect between object discovery and pattern recognition anchors structural coherence despite compressed word count, though post-climax resolution feels abbreviated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of artistic vanishing point as narrative device achieves powerful thematic resonance; closing image of "mosaic of justice" delivers intellectually satisfying emotional payoff rather than cheap thrills; subtext of artist/criminal duality elevates genre material.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids most procedural clichés through art-world fusion, but occasionally slips into overwritten phrases like "freight train wrapped in nostalgia"; some transitions between memory and present feel artificially smoothed; metaphors border on over-explanation at times.</comment>
