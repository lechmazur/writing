<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Inconsistent internalization undermines motivation; character remains an enigmatic surface despite eccentric traits. Voice lacks uniqueness to distinguish apathetic eagerness from narrative detachment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Static progression mimics routine rather than story; radio reports substitute for organic conflict. Closure feels artificial rather than earned through character transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Evocative visuals lack emotional anchoring; the boot's surreal qualities remain decorative. Sensory details catalogued like soil samples rather than immersing readers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Imagery (whip as serpent) fascinates but remains symbolic scaffolding; thematic tension between science/spirituality underexplored. Ending abandons potential soil-as-metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements function like gears in a machine rather than organic components. Radio exposition and whip-as-plot-tool feel contrived; emotional flatlining contradicts obsessive behavior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Coherence exists at conceptual level but not emotional; unique setting overshadowed by mechanical execution. Conceptual ambition exceeds thematic delivery.</comment>
