<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually present but underdeveloped; the "sacred symbols" revelation feels abrupt rather than earned through gradual psychological unraveling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structure achieves circularity with the self-decoding ending, but the plot mechanics (e.g., sudden washer transformation) strain plausibility despite effective pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evocative—crystalline spires, bioluminescent hieroglyphs—but risks overwhelming narrative substance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the story leans on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete emotional stakes that would elevate it to transcendent.</comment>
