<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are consistent, but internal struggles dominate over externalized actions, slightly diluting dramatic tension; reactions to objects like the mirror and masks effectively reveal psychological fragments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot builds through the protagonist’s obsessive reconstruction of masks and puzzle, with clear beginning/middle/end arcs; shifts from lab routine to epiphany are slightly compressed, impacting the pacing of emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere of sterile lab meets organic decay is evocative; chlorophyll sensors, ash, and shattered masks create dissonant yet cohesive sensory motifs; deeper environmental texture could enhance emotional immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (plants as compassionate vs. humans as hierarchical) are poetically rendered; ending avoids sentimentality, using the puzzle’s missing piece as a resonant symbol of self-acceptance; theme of surrender as strength feels nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids AI-style clichés (e.g., the masks’ scientific purpose isn’t gratuitous); emotional beats are shown through symbolic acts; some phrases (“noble foolishness”) flirt with abstraction but are grounded by visceral imagery like ash and splintered porcelain.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements are tightly woven into character psychology and theme; the 500-word constraint amplifies Marcus’s isolation and incremental growth, though the denouement’s didacticism slightly undercuts its visceral resonance.</comment>
