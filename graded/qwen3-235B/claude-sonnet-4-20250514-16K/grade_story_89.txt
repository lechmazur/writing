<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation lacks depth; her transformation from zealot to rebel is skimmed over, weakening her distinct voice and psychological nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Elements function within brief scope but don't fully coalesce; philosophical weight is hinted at but leaves limited lingering resonance.</comment>
