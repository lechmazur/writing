<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to outshine her reflection is clear and consistent, but emotional depth remains superficial. Actions align with her role as a summoner, but distinctive voice and complex inner life are underdeveloped despite the atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear progression from preparation to execution of the summoning ritual. The connection between the lighthouse's demolition and Kira's personal arc is logical, though pacing feels slightly compressed in later paragraphs. Cause/effect relationships are mostly coherent within the fantastical framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (quantum sand's flickering texture, lighthouse's rusted groans) create immersive atmosphere. The 'quantum beach' as setting meaningfully interacts with the concept of multiple realities, though some elements (demolition timeline) only partially integrate with the metaphysical context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("dimensional tears," "corroded rapture") elevates the prose. Subtext about destruction as creation is effective, but emotional resonance is diluted by excessive abstraction. The ending connects to the theme but lacks visceral impact due to prioritization of concept over character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>While the quantum beach and summoning mechanics feel original, certain phrases ("spark of invention," "seventeen dimensions") risk becoming ornate descriptors without emotional purpose. Some transitions feel formulaic, and motivation remains thematically stated rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elaborate concept execution overshadows character intimacy. Assigned elements serve thematic cohesion but occasionally feel forced (family tradition of destruction). Ending leaves intellectual resonance but lacks emotional durability. Formidable style occasionally obscures narrative substance.</comment>
