<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is coherent and emotionally resonant, with Elena's aimlessness juxtaposed against her urgent preservation purpose. However, her transformation from wanderer to inheritor of legacy feels slightly rushed despite the word count constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains internal logic with a clear beginning-mid-end progression, but the revelation about the handkerchief's encoded patterns feels slightly compressed. The snowflake motif bookends the story effectively, though some causal links between discoveries could be more meticulously rendered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively built through sensory details about dust motes and textiles, and the archive setting thematically supports the preservation theme. Some descriptions ("snowflake melts on warm skin") risk over-poeticism but remain purposeful for mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Storytelling succeeds through symbolism (patterns as cultural memory) and subtext about living histories. The handkerchief-revealed connection elevates impact, though some emotional beats ("tears of recognition") border on melodrama despite effective showing/telling balance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through the innovative concept of recipe-encoded games. While metaphors occasionally risk overextension ("seeds of vigilance"), the core idea of inherited knowledge through coded objects feels thoroughly human. Emotional beats are shown, not just stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Leverages constraints cohesively, with each element serving the archive's logic and Elena's arc. The connection between hopscotch patterns and cultural preservation feels particularly inspired, though the brevity occasionally strains theme/character pacing.</comment>
