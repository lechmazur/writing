<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character portrayed with emotional depth through symbolic actions, but lacks sufficient historical weight in dialogue and overt motivation; the 'voice' feels distilled yet underdeveloped for a former lawman.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence is restrained by minimal conflict resolution; the method of a misplaced letter drives the narrative but tension resolution feels truncated within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly visual but unevenly sensory; the castle setting aligns with themes but lacks organic integration with character's inner life.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor (kintsugi) elevates narrative into universal themes; ending is contemplative but under-delivers on emotional payoff through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but some phrasing ("faithful hound") borders on clich√©; emotional progression through action is nuanced but occasionally undercut by abstract descriptions.</comment>
