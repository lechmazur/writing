<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Thora’s meticulous surveillance and secret tapestry-weaving demonstrate clear motivation against systemic lies. Her dual identity as seamstress/spy is cohesive, though secondary characters lack definition. Subtle gestures (trembling fingers, paused stitching) poignantly reveal inner strain.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Concise narrative arc (from surveillance to rebellion) works within the word limit, but exposition about council corruption feels compressed. Some abruptness in transition to Earth authorities; tension peaks effectively without fully resolving the character’s personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stark Martian biodome atmosphere is palpable through failing systems and claustrophobic bookshop setting. Evocative details (tarnished lantern, Martian dawn) and surveillance anxiety deepen immersion. Martian landscape’s permanence contrasts with fragility of human systems.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors of tailoring vs. truth-weaving resonate thematically. The ending ties craft to rebellion powerfully, though the “grit of endurance” phrasing veers toward cliché. Emotional layers emerge through actions (hiding books, activating network) rather than stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in framing rebellion through bookshop subversion and needlework symbolism. Some phrases (“burning down lies”) lack freshness; the “earnest deception” concept feels organic but occasionally over-explained. Internal logic remains consistent despite high stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, with craft techniques mirroring narrative structure. Overpacked exposition slightly fractures momentum; the Martian colonial collapse premise feels simultaneously ambitious and underexplored within the limited word count.</comment>
