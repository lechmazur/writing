<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Marcus' internal conflict between impatience and discipline is shown through action, but emotional depth feels surface-level. His inherited destiny angle lacks psychological nuance beyond mythic archetypes. Motivation is consistent but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a descent-ascent structure with temporal revelations, but the tight word limit truncates resolution. The action feels suspended rather than completed - the "dancing dancer" ending lacks emotional payoff despite strong opening momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in submerged planetarium contrasts with neon lights above, but the thematic connection between club culture and temporal rupture remains underdeveloped. Dying starlight/sediment imagery creates haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("second skeleton," "temporal friction") and dual time imagery create resonant subtext about legacy and repair. Ending's thematic circularity (torch vs galaxy) delivers intellectual/emotional impact despite plot thinness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but exhibits occasional purple prose ("liquid mercury" galaxies, "captured starlight") and relies on familiar time-slip mechanics. Subtext feels human but some imagery borders on algorithmic accumulation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements serve the metaphysical theme cohesively despite contrivances. The brevity works as a vignette rather than a limitation, though the ending's implied sequel-bait undercuts completion. Leaves questions about "reality pampering" that feel intentional yet unearned.</comment>
