<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's introverted nature and dancer background are present but somewhat superficial; motivations remain consistent but lack psychological depth. The 'illogically logical' trait is shown through decoding methods but not fully integrated into her identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but hinges on abstract connection between dance and code-breaking. Pacing suffers slight unevenness in transitional logic between decoding and journey preparation. Resolution feels inevitable but under-explicated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Desolate atmosphere partially realized through sparse sensory details (smell of old paper, endless wasteland) but familiar tropes (cipher office, drought) dilute originality. Setting supports premise but lacks visceral uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Multilayered metaphors (dance/math, knitting/maps) enhance thematic resonance. Ending provides closure but subtext about embodied knowledge remains underdeveloped. Emotional impact is present but surface-level compared to immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through inventive fusion of movement and intellectual labor. Some phrases (e.g., 'crushing weight of responsibility') lean toward melodrama. Conceptual boldness overshadows minor stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative but integration feels occasionally mechanical—particularly the decoder's disappearance and 'forgotten echoes' framing. The theme of creativity surviving collapse resonates but lacks provocative undercurrents.</comment>
