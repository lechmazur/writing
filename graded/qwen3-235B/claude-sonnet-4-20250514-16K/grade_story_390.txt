<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation relies on prophecy without emotional grounding, reducing depth despite creative profession. Consistency in methods established, but inner conflict remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot builds tension methodically but sacrifices payoff by ending abruptly before consequences manifest. Butterfly wing timing device establishes symmetry but feels more schematic than organic within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Palace atmosphere created through sensory details (whispers, dried petals, incense smoke) effectively immerses readers, though historical setting remains decorative rather than shaping moral corruption's context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose elevates narrative with floral death-as-art parallels; subtext about beauty/corruption duality resonates. Predictable triple assassination structure detracts from deeper thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique assassination methods but contains familiar prophetic destiny tropes. Some elegant surprises in botanical execution methods, though character reasoning occasionally feels too logically precise for human decision-making.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds through compressed tension and thematic cohesion despite unresolved ending. Conceptual framework (poetic justice through flowers) binds elements tightly, though pacing sacrifices emotional payoff for structural cleverness.</comment>
