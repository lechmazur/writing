<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (gambling, connection) is clear but lacks depth in internal conflict; candle mold is underutilized as a motif to explore psyche; emotional arc (gamler's realization) feels somewhat rushed yet resonantly bittersweet; dialogue too often substitutes for fully embodied character reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative traces a coherent arc within tight constraints, but relies on compressed time rather than earned pacing; docking supply boat serves as effective deadline but climax hinges on abstract reflection rather than dramatized action; ending resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Isolated tidal station conveyed through sensory details (crashing waves vs. candlelight) creates strong mood contrast; candlelit dinners establish intimacy but timeframe device feels thematically disconnected from core metaphors; power station's purpose remains decorative rather than integral to plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegantly weaves metaphor (candle mold as fate-shaping, tides as uncertainty) with thematic resonance; subtext about gambling as self-destruction vs. human connection effectively layered; dialogue sparse but memorable; ending avoids sentimentality by framing defeat as emotional victory, though emotional payoff leans on abstraction over visceral experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√© through specific details (unhinged professors, tidal power), but character psychology occasionally simplifies into gamler's ruin archetype; emotional beats (tears of mixed emotion) show through action/dialogue but last-minute realization borders on trite; prose mostly crisp with exceptions (e.g., "connection in unlikely places") that feel rehearsed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (candle mold, tides, gambling) cohere conceptually more than emotionally; isolated setting serves plot logic but underexplored scientifically; concise form works for elegiac tone but limits full character immersion; themes resonate beyond surface narrative but execution remains slightly self-satisfied rather than transcendent.</comment>
