<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Bartholomew's theatricality is consistently portrayed but his motivation to "repossess what was stolen" lacks psychological depth; his performed kindness feels transactional rather than revealing complex emotion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression through riddle-solving is brisk yet functional, though the revolution’s resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect logic holds but lacks narrative weight due to constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imaginative setting (turtle-shell city) lacks concrete sensory details to make misty depths or shifting foundations visceral; tone blends whimsy and tension but leans too heavily on surface quirkiness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dramatic gestures and revolution-as-theater evoke playful irony, but emotional resonance is undercut by formulaic rebel archetypes and on-the-nose dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original setting is undermined by tropes (omnipotent villain, chosen-one protagonist); metaphors about economic oppression are surface-level, with little subversion of genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine into a coherent whole but without transcendent execution; the concept’s novelty fascinates briefly but doesn’t sustain thematic or emotional heft.</comment>
