<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character shows emotional complexity through rituals and internal conflict, but lacks deeper backstory development despite distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing tightens effectively into a complete arc despite brevity, with logical cause-effect in ritual and voice progression, though transitions between reflection and action occasionally strain.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral, precise imagery (blue ice crevasse, crystalline canopy) creates haunting atmosphere that mirrors character's isolation; sensory cohesion is exemplary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Story elevates beyond surface grief through metaphorical layering (safety pin as talisman, silence as existential weight) and emotionally resonant subtext in sparse, purposeful prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Nuanced emotionality and fresh metaphors (laughter cracking silence like an egg) avoid clich√©s, though minor moments veer toward ornate description without narrative function.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Element integration mostly organic, with tight synthesis between setting and theme; slight unevenness in weighted symbolism vs. functional narrative.</comment>
