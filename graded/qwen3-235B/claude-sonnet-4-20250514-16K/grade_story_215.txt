<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and trauma are clear but underexplored; internal conflict is hinted at but lacks depth. Dialogue and actions illustrate surface tension without fully delving into psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression via puzzles creates momentum, but the ending feels abrupt. Logical cause-effect within the framework, but pacing stumbles under word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting blends eerie tension with intellectual pursuit effectively, but sensory details remain too generalized to fully immerse readers in the environment's uniqueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance about science/spirituality synthesis; metaphors like music as metaphorical synthesis work. Overreliance on "guarded disclosures" as explanation weakens showing vs. telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Combination of faith-science theme avoids pure clich√©s but doesn't subvert expectations powerfully. Some fresh juxtapositions (dance/exorcism), but character psychology feels algorithmically simplified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements function but lack inventive cohesion. The brief length reveals narrative seams rather than feeling deliberately distilled. Theme lingers, but emotional impact remains moderate rather than profound.</comment>
