<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but depth suffers from exposition over internalization; emotional struggles hinted but not fully dramatized to resonate beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc achieved but relies heavily on contrived object-as-tool logic; airplane trajectory provides temporal tension but the leaves' revelations lack earned dramatic weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with specific sensory details about decay and light; tone/setting cohesion strong though the carnival connection feels underexplored thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (fork as both broken and functional) and thematic resonance in transforming knowledge/legacy elevate the poetic impact; ending crystallizes meaning effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No overt formulaicism evident; some phrases ("liquid moonlight") approach clich√© but overall execution feels distinctive; emotional subtext primarily shown rather than declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative purpose but some (carnival dining hall) feel like checklist items; brief length enhances urgency but certain connections remain underdeveloped.</comment>
