<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is visually evocative but emotionally opaque; motivation lacks textured depth despite symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to resolution but feels compressed; pivotal moments lack breathing room within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric garden rendered with rich sensory texture; some conceptual elements (e.g., metallic sun) inconsistently contextualized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate; ending delivers thematic payoff. Subtext about collective isolation elevates. Overwriting slightly dilutes emotional precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original conceit with nuanced emotional layering. A few phrases ("hushed confession") approach overfamiliarity; largely avoids formulaic traps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity; elements serve both plot and meaning without feeling forced. Depth occasionally sacrificed to poetic brevity.</comment>
