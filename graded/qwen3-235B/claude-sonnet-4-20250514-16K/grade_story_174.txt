<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (regret and love) is emotionally resonant but lacks granular psychological depth; his identity as a fireworks designer feels more symbolic than organic to his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect logic in the frost map/leaf alignment, but the condensed scope strains the emotional payoff; the library's transient nature creates narrative tension but compresses resolution into a poetic yet abrupt conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Romanticized mist and time distortions create atmosphere, but sensory details prioritize visual poetry over tangible lived-in texture; the library's physical logic (dry wet walls) lacks follow-through.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (fireworks/memories, leaves/formulas) intertwine theme with plot; the ending's duality of “burn eternal”/“darkness” encapsulates the protagonist's acceptance. Subtly layered regret/redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>“Perpetual mist,” “ephemeral nature” flirt with romantic overwriting; some sensory details (frost patterns=leaf veins) are striking but others verge on New Age vagueness. Emotional subtext is shown, not stated, but the “faded library” risks trope status.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mosaic of grief-as-quest is cohesive, though the rapid transition from discovery to revelation feels structurally imbalanced; the alchemy of emotion/science concept lingers, while the waterfall’s symbolism remains frustratingly abstract.</comment>
