<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters demonstrate clear motivations but lack depth; the stoic wanderer remains enigmatic without fully realized emotional complexity, while Morrigan's transformation feels compressed yet plausible within constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies on rapid pacing; the narrative momentum created by the erased formula and dream-realm resolution works within the word count, but transitions between emotional beats feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere establishes witchcraft academia through minimal details (wards, blackboard formulas), but lacks distinctive sensory texture; the training ground setting is functional rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolic objects (floorboard as both artifact and dream key) and thematic contrasts (preservation vs fear); the ending resonates with quiet gravitas despite limited character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt cliche but leans on familiar mystical-academia tropes; "brash tenderness" trait is uniquely applied, though some phrasing ("protective wards hummed") edges toward genre conventionality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically, though the narrative's brevity leaves thematic and emotional depth partially unrealized; succeeds as tight genre piece but lacks transcendent literary ambition.</comment>
