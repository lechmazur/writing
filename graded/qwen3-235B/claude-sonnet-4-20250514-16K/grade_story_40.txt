<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths include linking reincarnation to current actions and clear motivation around guilt; weaknesses in underdeveloped internal conflict and inconsistent emotional nuance despite strong symbolic gestures like the plastic soldier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective circular structure within word constraints and cause-effect coherence; pacing occasionally drags in atmospheric passages but maintains momentum through the storm-driven encounter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pungent sensory details (dust, rain, skylight cracks) enhance the ethereal atmosphere; some setting elements (e.g., "bending reality" shelves) feel vaguely sketched rather than deeply integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (guilt as plastic weight, rain-streaked windows as catharsis) and layered themes merge subtextual depth with emotional resonance; ending achieves thematic symmetry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through absurd-yet-poignant combinations (goldfish therapy, metaphysical recipes); occasional overly ornate phrasing ("cosmic luggage") never overwhelms narrative clarity or emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity rather than checklist filling; brevity amplifies existential compression; leaves lingering questions about reincarnation mechanics vs. emotional truth.</comment>
