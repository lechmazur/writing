<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and a distinct scenario, but reactions and emotional transitions feel cinematic rather than psychologically credible. Transformation from passive to active lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot drives forward with urgency but relies on familiar thriller structures with unlikely coincidences (precise countdown timing, overly clever doodles on receipts). The resolution feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Laboratory setting offers rich metaphorical potential with crystal growth, but atmospheric details remain superficial. The countdown provides tension but fireworks imagery appears arbitrarily.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</comment><comment>Effective use of crystal imagery as metaphor for truth and time, some resonant final reflections. However, relies too heavily on telling rather than showing, with melodramatic resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Contains fresh combinations (bartender/crime solver) but leans on genre tropes (hidden evidence, countdown tension). Descriptions occasionally veer into poetic abstraction but generally maintain purposeful simplicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attempts to integrate multiple assigned elements but several feel forced rather than organic. The brevity creates tension but prevents deeper exploration of themes. Style occasionally creates emotional distance.</comment>
