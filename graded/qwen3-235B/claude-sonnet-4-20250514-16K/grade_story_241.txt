<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (documenting phenomena) are clear but psychological depth feels underexplored. Voice/demeanor alignment is strong, but emotional stakes remain vague.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression follows logical cause-effect but feels compressed. Storm climax works but resolution feels abrupt within word limit; structural framing needs tighter cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cloud cafe setting has vivid imagery but insufficiently developed physical sensations. Sensory details about sound/pressure are effective but temperature, scent, and tactile elements missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (embroidery as technology, sound as magnetic force) create intellectual resonance. Emotional payoff is muted but atmospheric language elevates overall impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept execution elevates it above formulaic sci-fi, but occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., "blissful agony of anticipation") undermines subtlety. Emotional nuance sometimes explicit rather than demonstrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual framework integrates assigned elements but creates inherent tension rather than organic narrative. Lingering questions exist more about scientific phenomena than human experience.</comment>
