<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character transformation is clear but lacks nuanced progression. Internal conflict is conveyed via metaphor rather than consistent behavioral shifts. Grogginess fades as a defining trait post-opening.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a cohesive arc within constraints, but the transition from introspection to action feels narratively compressed rather than organically paced. The mirror-driven climax functions logically but lacks incremental tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (e.g., dust motes, chilled air) and symbolic setting, though the protest's integration with the mansion's Gothic dread remains superficial. The graveyard mirrors character psychology effectively but lacks layered realism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (mirror as self-reckoning) and thematic cohesion elevates the narrative. The climax's emotional resonance is undercut by on-the-nose exposition ("darkness in him"). Subtext about complacency is thought-provoking but unevenly balanced between showing and telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting metaphysical horror tropes (mirror as introspection tool vs. typical supernatural object). Avoids excessive ornamentation, though protest dynamics and brewing background lean on generic descriptors rather than specific authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively combines elements, though protest dynamics and "uniquely generic" framing remain underexplored. The tight structure serves thematic brevity but sacrifices deeper context. Lingering reflection arises more from metaphor than character or setting intricacies.</comment>
