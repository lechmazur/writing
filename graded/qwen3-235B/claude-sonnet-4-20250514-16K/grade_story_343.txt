<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Madrigal's melancholy is visually expressed through his painted smile and tears, but his abrupt shift from passive observer to authoritative leader lacks psychological complexity; character motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>   
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gathering the crew feels contrived, and the transition from ritual to unity occurs without narrative friction; tight construction sacrifices emotional plausibility and logical progression for poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine and bioluminescent mandala create a compellingly claustrophobic yet mystical atmosphere, but the paint-drying timeframe serves more as a device than an organic constraint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery of decay and rebirth resonates thematically, but overreliance on adjectives like "crooked hope" and "sacred practices" leans on abstraction rather than earned emotional stakes; ending feels aspirational, not inevitable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Visionary elements are undercut by generic descriptors ("metal table," "mechanical grimness"); metaphors like "ocean's patience" verge on cliche; character responses to ritual lack individualized nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts to balance mythic resonance with intimate character moments, but conceptual cohesion falters under the weight of compressed storytelling; thematic ambition exceeds execution.</comment>
