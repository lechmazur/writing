<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid initial characterization but motivation shift from con artist to redeemer feels hurried, though the dispenser prop effectively bridges past/present. The "unusually normal" trait isn't fully leveraged.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong emotional arc but compressed resolution feels abrupt; beginning/end connection works, though the ghost-interrogation method lacks mechanical logic within the world-building.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Economical but potent sensory details (radiation scars, hollow cheeks) and dystopian structure create immersion; ghostly contrast complements tone without overpowering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical power of "empty dispenser" and haunting imagery elevate storytelling; subtext about memory as resistance creates intellectual heft; subtle showing of redemption through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant construction avoids most tropes, though ghostly apparitions border on familiar; emotional nuance shown through physicality (tucking dispenser) rather than stating; language remains urgent without excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements interlock tightly (scam artist using props becomes storyteller) with thematic cohesion; short form works as deliberate showcase for transformation rather than constraint; lingers emotionally.</comment>
