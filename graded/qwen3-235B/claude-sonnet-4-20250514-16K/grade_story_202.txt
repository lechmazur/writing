<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's identity as a poisoner informs the plot but lacks emotional depth, relying too heavily on labels rather than demonstrating skill or internal conflict. Her motivation for reclaiming the rapier feels underexplored despite its generational significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Non-linear scavenger hunt disrupts causality; some clues feel arbitrarily connected to plot progression. The scavenger hunt structure provides momentum but sacrifices narrative cohesion, especially in the compressed timeframe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Skateboarding and starlit museum create vivid, kinetic atmosphere with sensory specifics (humming wheels, invisible ink). Final revelation lacks tangible environmental payoff; gravitic metaphors underutilized in physical setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("poisoner's code of instinct") and thematic resonance about legacy vs. individuality elevate the story, but overuse of poetic abstraction ("edges of gravity") occasionally dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but occasionally veers toward purple prose with metaphysical abstractions. The scavenger hunt concept feels algorithmically structured rather than organically mysterious; emotional stakes remain somewhat generalized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but not always thematically—skateboarding movement feels more aesthetic than structural. The story’s compressed scope works thematically but sacrifices deeper exploration of its most compelling ideas (toxic legacy, inherited identity).</comment>
