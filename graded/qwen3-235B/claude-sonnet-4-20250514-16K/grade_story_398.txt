<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond symbolic role; motivation is clear but underdeveloped emotionally. Interactions are sparse and don't reveal unique voice or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a slim arc but resolution feels abrupt. Connections between elements are logical but condensed progression sacrifices emotional stakes within limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal setting and sensory details (charred paper, humming looms) create immersive atmosphere that thematically reinforces the struggle between decay and resilience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Certain elements veer toward familiar tropes (wise old sage, magical mentor's artifact) but avoid outright clich√© through the unique 'dysfunctionally functional' looms and surreal details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>Story feels conceptually cohesive but sacrifices emotional immediacy; assigned elements function thematically rather than organically driving narrative urgency.</comment>
