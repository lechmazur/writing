<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's jovial past is established but depth beyond surface traits is limited; motivations are clear but psychological complexity lacks subtlety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end within constraints, but pacing stumbles slightly under word limit; constellations driving plot resolution feels rushed despite clever design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ethereal details like black roses create mood, but atmosphere-character integration falters - decaying garden doesn't fully mirror internal state until resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (vow as family curse, garden rebirth mirroring character) elevate narrative; thematic threads exist but lack layered subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uncommon elements like withering vow and celestial time capsule show creativity, but witch's garden tropes and occasional overwrought phrases ("elegant mayhem") undermine uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Convoluted element integration strains plausibility (astrological telescope's precise nighttime use); themes resonate but surface-level execution prevents lasting impact.</comment>
