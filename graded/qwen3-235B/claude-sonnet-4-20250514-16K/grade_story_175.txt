<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Corvain's internal conflict between tradition and truth is compelling, but Thessa remains underdeveloped, serving more as a narrative device than a distinct character. The motivation for Corvain's rebellion against elders feels organic, though his "innocently mischievous" trait lacks sufficient behavioral anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Intertwined decay of the sign and Harvest Song provides structural cohesion. The exposition about forbidden knowledge feels rushed, while the ending's tension between truth and tradition resolves too neatly. Pacing balances atmospheric buildup with narrative momentum but struggles to contain all setup within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent mushroom village creates vivid bioluminescent atmosphere, effectively connecting fungal imagery to themes of decay and abandonment. However, the Great Mushroom's pulsed rhythms feel underutilized as symbolic backdrop, and some sensory details (mushroom cap textures) remain superficial despite strong visual elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like the singing empty cage and dissolving paint chips are strikingly layered. The dialogue-heavy climax lacks physical gestures but maintains thematic momentum. The unresolved ending invites contemplation of truth's cost rather than closure, achieving emotional resonance through symbolic weight rather than explicit emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Richly original worldbuilding occasionally succumbs to overcrowded prose ("feral elegance of a predator who hunted truth"). Some phrases lean toward artificial grandeur rather than earned pathos, though the subversion of tradition and knowledge-as-betrayal theme avoids common template narratives. Emotional beats are shown through objects rather than stated outright.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>While the story's framework feels meticulously constructed around its constraints, cohesion occasionally strains under heavy conceptual load. All elements combine inventively with thematic precision, though brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of Thessa's dilemma. Lingering questions about collective delusion elevate its intellectual resonance despite practical limitations.</comment>
