<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is hindered by abrupt transitions in motivation. While Marcus's backstory adds depth, the dummy's sudden catalytic effect lacks psychological nuance. His transformation feels more symbolic than earned, with poetic revelations prioritized over organic emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence through the dummy's thematic role, but pacing stumbles under word constraints. The shift from theft to poetry occurs without tangible emotional groundwork. The ending resolves neatly but risks feeling didactic rather than dramatically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on gothic clichés (abandoned lighthouse, rusted machinery) with limited sensory specificity. The setting's decay mirrors Marcus's psyche but isn't fully leveraged—its potential as a mirror for transformation remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and metaphorical language elevate thematic resonance. The dummy's paradoxical wisdom and Marcus's verses effectively 'show' inner conflict. Dialogue avoids exposition, while the layered ending provokes reflection on redemption without sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic patterns in its hybridization of crime and magical realism. Marcus's poetic voice possesses individuality, but AI-like tendencies emerge in occasionally ornate descriptions ("water through cupped hands"). Subtext is present but sometimes eclipses narrative subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but predictable in its redemption arc. Assigned elements (dummy, poetry) serve theme but aren't indispensably fused. The ending lingers conceptually, though tighter interweaving of timeframe and setting could enhance narrative depth.</comment>
