<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development for Viktor shows internal conflict through actions but relies too much on exposition; his motivations are clear but nuanced backstory lacking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but the detour feels abrupt; cause-effect is clear but structural coherence suffers from tight word limit and underdeveloped transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (frozen wasteland, skeletal gardens) but occasionally relies on generic descriptors like "whispering secrets."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (seeds=spring/change), but dialogue occasionally tells rather than shows; ending resonates thematically despite some overused metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Effective subversion of "kingpin" trope; originality in linking isolation to literal/metaphorical winter. Some predictable phrasing ("bronze plaque green with neglect") weakens impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>The storyâ€™s theme is clear but surface-level; elements integrate logically yet occasionally feel imposed rather than organically woven into narrative momentum.</grade>
