<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maya’s aloofness as an orphan is deeply tied to her emotional trajectory; her guarded nature informs her interactions with the stones and the cryptic message, culminating in a credible, if slightly abrupt, transformation. The internal logic of her motivation (fear of loss) driving her eventual emotional openness is coherent and resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured around the garage-cleaning timeframe, with the gravitational anomaly and cryptic message organically propelling the arc from emotional stasis to resolution. Pacing is efficient, but the leap from discovery of the message to her epiphany feels slightly rushed within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly’s physical distortions are vividly rendered through sensory details (dust spirals, floating tools), and the stones’ warmth and magnetism contrast with the detached, cold setting. Atmosphere powerfully reinforces the theme of emotional dislocation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story’s metaphor (gravity as emotional anchoring) and imagery (stones as guides) resonate deeply, with a clear theme of adaptive love in unstable environments. The ending feels earned but leans slightly on abstract assertions rather than fully enacted emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The writing avoids overt clichés and maintains a precise, evocative tone. Subtext (e.g., the stones “remembering the way home”) is fresh, though the gravitas of Maya’s transformation could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict rather than tidy thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements harmonize to create a poignant, self-contained narrative. The gravitational anomaly and stones are integral to both plot and theme; the story’s brevity enhances its thematic focus rather than limiting depth.</comment>
