<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; emotional conflict hinted at through symbolism rather than earned through nuanced interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression moves logically through symbolic revelations but feels slightly rushed; thematic resolution is satisfying but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (desert/alpine contrasts, tactile carousel descriptions) create vivid immersion, though the monastery's cultural context remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering of storms/restoration/healing; some emotional beats told rather than shown (e.g., "ache in his chest") weaken impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar storm/hurts-will-heal parallels; tapestry-as-code trope feels slightly contrived despite fresh execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coheres through metaphorical unity but occasionally prioritizes thematic messaging over organic character decisions.</comment>
