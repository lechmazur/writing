<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits but lacks emotional depth; motivations are implied rather than explored, with "bashful arrogance" serving more as descriptor than demonstrated behavior. The first-person whispering reveals internal conflict but remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but relies on abstract cosmic stakes; the jigsaw-to-marble action drives the story yet feels underdeveloped. Pacing is efficient in word-constrained structure, though cause/effect for reality-reassembly lacks visceral grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting offers thin sci-fi scaffolding; the lunar colony's details (humming machinery, dome lighting) create atmosphere but don't deepen character or plot. Sensory specifics are vivid but isolated rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric framework (fragments as timelines, puzzles as repair) elevates the narrative. The ending's click resonates thematically, though emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction over tangible character reaction. Subtext about destructive creation lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s in concept blending but treads a fine line with terms like "cosmic scoreboard." Imagery is fresh (beautiful breakage) but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("happy sadness"). Tone remains consistent despite occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements interact cohesively but create structural tension; the lunar setting feels appended rather than integral. The fragment-as-method shows ingenuity despite feeling conceptually strained. Ends with resonant questions about rewriting reality. </comment>
