<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "rationally impulsive" are stated rather than organically demonstrated. Emotional motivations feel plausible but lack layered complexity; the synthesis of adult/child perspectives is effective but lacks unique voice in third-person limited perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; flashbacks and discoveries occur too smoothly. Some cause-and-effect connections (e.g., detecting the hidden stone) rely on contrived performativity rather than sustained tension within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere through sensory details (whispering fabric, shifting sunlight) is evocative but underdeveloped. The post-oil setting requires more specific worldbuilding—cultural shifts, architectural repurposing—to fully support the story’s emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "emotional geometry" add resonance, and the theme of art-as-investigation is intriguing. However, the ending’s resolution feels overly tidy, sacrificing ambiguity that could have deepened impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While avoiding major clichés, phrases like "whispered secrets" and "gossamer threads of illusion" verge on overwrought lyricism. Emotional subtext relies too heavily on abstraction rather than visceral embodiment of the victim’s experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story’s speculative premise elevates its cohesion, but some assigned elements (solar panels, oil depletion) feel applied rather than integral. The narrative arc feels slightly preordained, leaving little room for interpretive resonance.</comment>
