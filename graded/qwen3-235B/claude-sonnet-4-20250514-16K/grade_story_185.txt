<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has forward momentum but relies on esoteric explanations; the piano key method feels narratively forced despite thematic relevance; pacing works within the word limit but lacks tension refinement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting's sterile, computational atmosphere contrasts effectively with poetic elements; sensory details are evocative but inconsistently distributed; probability mapping center's logic poorly rationalized beyond aesthetic purposes.</comment>
