<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but psychological complexity feels surface-level; the protagonist's defiance and hope lack nuanced internal conflict despite vivid external actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function smoothly within constraints but the cyclical structure risks feeling static; the seed-planting ritual doesn't build substantial narrative momentum despite strong symbolic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Superb sensory worldbuilding creates a hauntingly immersive post-apocalyptic atmosphere; every description from "whispering silver grass" to "aware starlight" contributes to the setting's haunting resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional emotional resonance through metaphor and subtext; the fusion of genetic experimentation with spiritual longing creates layered thematic impact, though some poetic abstractions border on vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through magical realism integration but occasionally falters with slightly overwrought phrasing ("tiny heartbeats against her palm") and under-explored conceptual elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements combine with surprising cohesion considering density; brevity serves thematic concentration rather than feeling restrictive, though some conceptual intersections could deepen.</comment>
