<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's torn nature is stated, not shown through nuanced conflict; motivations feel plot-driven rather than psychologically complex; reactions to objects rely on contrivance over organic curiosity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc despite word limit, but sudden leaps (e.g., consciousness preservation) undermine narrative logic; pacing uneven between atmospheric description and rapid resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting's decay and electromagnetic atmosphere are vividly rendered with strong sensory details; some disconnect between 1920s device and futuristic implications weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through subtext (silent child's question, tears in dust); metaphor of fractured knowledge as solar/climate crisis metaphor works effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s but falters in tech explanation plausibility; emotional beats rely slightly on stated motivations rather than layered subtext or reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity between elements, though some (torn visionary, timeframe) feel imposed rather than integral; concise form enhances mystery but sacrifices deeper exploration.</comment>
