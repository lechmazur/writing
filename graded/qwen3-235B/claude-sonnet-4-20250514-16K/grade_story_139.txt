<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks deeper psychological complexity; the stubborn monk archetype feels familiar rather than deeply individualized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot's revenge arc is coherent but the compressed structure leaves some narrative gaps; the gondola setting effectively frames the progression but resolution feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mountain monastery setting and atmospheric details enhance the spiritual/revenge tension; however, some sensory descriptions verge on generic (e.g., "mountain mists" without unique tactile qualities).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolic objects and haunting imagery creates lingering resonance; some emotional beats could be more subtly portrayed rather than stated directly (e.g., "grim smile" instead of interior reflection).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Familiar revenge tropes undercut originality; the forensic dental analysis feels conceptually inventive but borders on implausibility; prose veers between striking metaphors and occasionally overadorned phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>The story successfully integrates assigned elements but doesn't transcend their combination; the "bitter fruit" metaphor and monastery bells create thematic depth that elevates the otherwise formulaic structure.</grade>
