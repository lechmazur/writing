<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters convey longing through symbolic gestures but lack dimensional depth; motivations rooted in unspoken history feel somewhat abstract without sufficient emotional context or personal stakes to ground their connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>A linear throughline (Kenji preparing for/aligning with the meteor shower) creates structure, but the compressed timeframe flattens potential emotional payoff; the celestial-floral code's mechanics overshadow character-driven progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (moonlight on easels, preserved blossoms) evoke mood, but the castle's transformation from military structure to artistic space remains underexplored, diluting historical weight that could deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (flowers as celestial coordinates, meteors as emotional semiotics) elevate the narrative; the final line achieves haunting poignancy, though some lyrical passages border on self-indulgence rather than narrative necessity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through celestial-botanical symbology, but floral "language" occasionally risks preciousness; emotional subtext is primarily shown through action (flower placement, shared glances), though cosmic parallels border on overdetermined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly organic—the castle's reinvention and celestial events create thematic symmetry—but certain elements (herbalist specifics) feel peripheral rather than essential to the narrative machinery.</comment>
