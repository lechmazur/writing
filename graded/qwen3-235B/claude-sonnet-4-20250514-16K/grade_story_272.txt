<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation and traits are present but underdeveloped. The conflict between Marcus' cynicism and hope feels surface-level; his transition from obsessed drudge to confident discoverer lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a functional arc but compresses key revelations too abruptly. The deciphering process is intriguing but the shift from frustration to breakthrough lacks detailed logic or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong visually and sensorially (grease, fluorescent light) but emotionally thin. The diner setting shapes the character’s isolation but doesn’t deepen thematic contrasts between past and future.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like the "tree of regret" and whistle-as-key show literary craft. The ending’s interplay of hope and exhaustion is poignant, though heavier themes occasionally tilt toward melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids formula through unique concepts (resonant encryption), though the redemptive arc feels somewhat familiar. Prose is purposeful but occasionally leans on ornate descriptors ("midnight symphony") that border on indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>The story coherently integrates its elements but feels like a condensed prologue rather than a self-contained narrative. The ending promises impact but leaves too much thematic potential unrealized in the word limit.</comment>
