<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While Marta's dual nature as cynically gentle baker/revolutionary shapes her actions, psychological depth remains surface-level; motivations are clear but lack introspective complexity beyond narrative function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Temporal rebellion mechanics integrate logically, but compressed word count flattens tension; lunar timelines and flower-based contagion provide tight cause-effect, though the rushed climax slightly undermines resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like "flour-dusted floorboards" and "whispers of older languages" create rich mood, but the time machine's garage setting clashes tonally with mystical elements, diluting immersion in key moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric fusion of botany and revolution delivers thematic resonance; lyrical prose and "contagion of hope" subtext elevate impact, though emotional beats occasionally verge on sentimental abstraction rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elegant phrasing occasionally curdles into clich√© ("whispers older than human memory") while the core concept of flowers-as-weaponized-temporal-artifacts shows ingenuity; some descriptions prioritize poetic abstraction over concrete specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade>Story synthesizes assigned elements cohesively despite word constraints, but leans too heavily on fantastical conceits to carry thematic weight; the bakery/time machine duality cleverly bridges mundane and magical, if occasionally unevenly balanced.</grade>
