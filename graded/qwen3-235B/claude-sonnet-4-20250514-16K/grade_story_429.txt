<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond archetypal tropes; motivations (restoring knowledge) are clear but insufficiently tied to character-specific traits or lived experience as a farmer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story follows a coherent ritual-to-revelation structure, but the fusion of aurora physics with audio restoration feels rushed; some cause-effect logic between spice application and cylinder awakening requires hand-waving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The northern lights function as visual spectacle rather than worldbuilding—no cultural specificity, weather effects, or environmental stakes anchor the setting; atmospheric potential squandered in favor of poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Gorgeous lyrical prose and rich metaphorical layering (aurora as paper-folding, electromagnetic resonance as ancestral dialogue); the silent-to-speaking transition carries profound intergenerational weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; the fusion of agricultural expertise with audio restoration as cultural preservation is inventive. Some phrases ("whispered songs") border on overused mysticism, but imaginative core elevates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High concept execution but uneven character grounding; elements like the farmer scale cohere conceptually yet lack emotional anchoring; the ending resonates but feels conceptually over-character driven.</comment>
