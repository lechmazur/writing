<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is clearly motivated by unresolved past and generational trauma, with actions aligning with his hardened persona. Emotional complexity is hinted through poetic contradictions, but interiority occasionally veers into literary shorthand rather than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Focused structure with a clear emotional arc within constraints, but pivots rely on loaded imagery over fully realized progression. The circularity of returning to darkness after momentary clarity works thematically, though feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting merges with emotional states through kaleidoscopic imagery and impossible geometry, creating haunting atmosphere. Physical descriptions overwhelm thematic integration; worldbuilding occasionally distracts from character focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent literary devices (e.g., refracted light as emotional mirror) and poetic self-awareness elevate impact. Thematic resonance about vulnerability/survival emerges organically, though some metaphors risk overexplanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal setting and poetic juxtaposition. Some phrasing (e.g., "warrior prince") flirts with clich√©, while sensory details occasionally prioritize prettiness over specificity. Emotional depth genuine but occasionally explicit rather than subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</degree><comment>Story transcends 'prompt checklist' usage through interconnected symbolism. Elements serve emotional truth rather than mere function, though brevity leaves underdeveloped implications of the park's metaphysics. Lingering resonance stems from emotional candor over twist.</comment>
