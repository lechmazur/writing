<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Regis' contrition and motivation are established but underexplored; his transformation through kindness feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Efficient pacing but relies on convenient plot devices (e.g., magical yarn); resolution lacks emotional payoff proportionate to the protagonist's journey.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Magical elements like the floating island and yarn are vivid but superficially developed; atmosphere leans heavily on clich√©d fantasy tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (tattoos as deception, yarn as truth) and ironic resolution through nonviolence; emotional subtext is implied rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends tropes (exiled knight, hidden tattoos) predictably but subverts expectations with yarn magic; some purple prose and abrupt narrative shifts undercut originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive but unevenly weighted; secondary characters feel flat, and the ending prioritizes whimsy over thematic resonance.</comment>
