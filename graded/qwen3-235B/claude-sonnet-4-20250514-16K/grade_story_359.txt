<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (salvaging a dream via brewing/sound) is conceptually clear but underdeveloped; Marcus's voice leans on abstract melancholy without visceral specificity. The "absent-minded" trait influences minor actions but doesn't deepen his agency or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single under-explained revelation (haptic translation) that resolves emotional stakes too neatly. The tight word count sacrifices setup for the technological leap; cause-effect between Marcus's brewing background and the solution feels implied rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dampened, reverential atmosphere in the archive—a sanctuary of extinction—is evoked through tactile details (weathered brass, trembling hands) and ironic contrasts (servers humming vs. extinct birdsong). The sterile environment mirrors emotional repression, with thunderstorms-as-yearning tying setting to theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The metaphor of fermentation as transformation elevates the narrative, offering layered meaning. Sensory "showing" (kinesthetic grief, beer as lost language) overrides some telling, though the ending's "brewing new beginnings" risks over-explanation. The central tension (preservation vs. obsolescence) resonates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lacks predictable dystopian tropes but flirts with "solemn archive" clichés. Phrases like "sediment in unfiltered beer" marry specificity and metaphor effectively, while "storms of doubt" feels generically poetic. Emotional nuance (Marcus's professional obsolescence) edges out formulaic writing but isn't fully dissected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element cohesion is uneven: kinesthizing sound is imaginative and central; the brass knocker and train station encounter are disposable. The story's brevity works thematically (ephemeral vs. preserved) but limits exploration of its most striking idea—tactile nostalgia as cultural salvation.</comment>
