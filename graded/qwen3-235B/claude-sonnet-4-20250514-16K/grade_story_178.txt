<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Limited portrayal of clerk role; motivation is clear but emotional depth lacks nuance. Her voice is distinct but filtered through overly poetic abstractions rather than grounded personal specifics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fractured coherence between trivia trigger and worldbuilding; cause-effect logic strained by abrupt skill acquisition. Pacing manages to contain stakes but sacrifices explanatory clarity for narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Undersea setting and dissonant calm create evocative sensory contrasts. Atmosphere deeply enhances mood but could better integrate with thematic exploration of disease and healing processes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but skirts 'chosen one' tropes. Some over-reliance on poetic abstraction dilutes the human elements; prose remains purposeful but occasionally decorative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive but strained by overcrowded concepts. Length works for vignette format but truncates emotional weight. Ending lingers effectively despite structural imperfections.</comment>
