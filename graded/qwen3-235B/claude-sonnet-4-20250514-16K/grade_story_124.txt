<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains emotionally vague; past movements from Earth/Mars to Moon mentioned but not dramatized. Motivation to "discover subconscious power" feels abstract rather than action-based. Reaction to ballet shoes relies on telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot drifts rather than progresses - static meditation scene lacks narrative momentum. No clear beginning/middle/end structure within constraints. Connection between staring at console and later decision to teach isn't logically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chrome surfaces vs. silk metaphors create striking contrasts. Sensory details like humming life support and warmed ballet shoes effectively establish lunar atmosphere while contrasting rustic memories. Some of the most evocative setting work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose creates powerful imagery with threads of consciousness. The weaving/grace motif provides thematic throughline. Subtext about connecting human minds across space adds philosophical resonance. Ending feels conceptually rich but narratively underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Woven consciousness concept is fresh but execution borders on pseudoscientific vagueness. Ballet shoes as connection device feels genuine, but lunar setting doesn't fully transcend genre expectations. Some overly polished metaphors suggest conceptual over-engineering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story maintains stylistic consistency and conceptual ambition, but struggles with narrative cohesion within constraints. Poetic flourishes compensate for thin plot structure. Leaves intellectual resonance rather than emotional impact.</comment>
