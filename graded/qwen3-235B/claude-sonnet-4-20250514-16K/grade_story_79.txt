<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Martha's motivation as a rebel against bureaucratic closure is clear but lacks nuanced backstory; her actions align with her ghostly resolve, but her sheriff identity isn't fully explored beyond genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plotting is tightly compressed but coherent, with logical cause-effect between the chain’s reaction and Evelyn’s revelation; the brevity occasionally strains full emotional payoff of the transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in the library’s liminal atmosphere; the suspended midday, cathedral windows, and stardust motifs create a mood that mirrors the theme of transcendent duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors like "moonlight made manifest" and "cosmic poetry" elevate the prose; the ending resonates thematically, though some descriptive passages verge on ornamental without deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through poetic surrealism and nuanced emotional restraint; sensory details are specific but occasionally edge into ornate abstractions ("celestial longing") that risk distancing the reader.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Impressive synthesis of assigned elements within the tight word count, though some—like "echo of quiet"—feel conceptually underserved; the central transformation concept lingers memorably.</comment>
