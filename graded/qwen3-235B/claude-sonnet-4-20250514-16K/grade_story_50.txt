<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's duality is clear but remains internally consistent without sufficient exploration of psychological complexity; reactions to elements like the fork reveal mystical hunger but lack visceral, nuanced human vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coherent transformation arc with symbolic object use, but compressed pacing leaves cause-effect gaps; the piano's dissonant revelation ties plot together but feels slightly rushed despite strong conceptual foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually and acoustically immersive setting where glass textures and sound physics create haunting atmosphere; tone of isolated revelation works seamlessly with crystalline decay and dying monarch motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong poetic language creates lingering metaphysical questions through harmonic mysticism motifs, though spiritual decay theme sometimes stated rather than embodied; ending resonates more through sensory execution than philosophical closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echoes of formal theological language suggest organic obsession but some crystalline imagery risks poetic excess; avoids genre clich√©s through unique piano-worship fusion yet retains slight algorithmic cadence in rhythmic sentence structures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive mysticism narrative despite minor contextual gaps; the butterfly's death and piano's dissonance create thematic tension while maintaining economy of language appropriate to format.</comment>
