<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's muteness and ventriloquism shape narrative well; motivation for archiving weather is clear but underprioritized. Hopeless optimism emerges through reactions but lacks nuanced depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains emotional arc and coherence within constraints. Cardboard sleeve drives the story effectively, though pacing of dimension-hopping transitions occasionally strains logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Parallel universe beach offers vivid atmosphere but underuses its surreal potential. Sensory details are evocative but occasionally generic; purple sand and auroras lean on visual flair over functional worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors for family as weather patterns are potent and layered. Ending resonates thematically; dialogue serves character voice. Tension is small-scale but emotionally precise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unconventional premise avoids formulaic tropes. Some metaphors flirt with cliché but are redeemed by context. Emotional beats derive from "showing"—archival listening, Marvin's dialogue rather than explicit declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements cohesively but unevenly. Core theme of redefined family unites disparate parts. Style enhances meaning; length feels intentional as a single transformative moment.</comment>
