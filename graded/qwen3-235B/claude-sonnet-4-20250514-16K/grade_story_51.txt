<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus's guilt and apologetic nature drive his obsessive actions, but his "rationally subjective" trait remains underexplored. The wooden slat as a physical manifestation of his past adds depth, though dialogue lacks distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Concision amplifies emotional beats; museum stalking escalates organically to confrontation. Pacing is tight, but abrupt character recognition lacks grounding. The ending's metaphorical resonance provides satisfying closure within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Static electricity garden's hum mirrors psychological tension, museum's sterile lighting evokes institutional detachment. Sensory details (metal sculptures, rough slat) create atmosphere, but more environmental texture could strengthen emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dialogue-driven revelation about resilience transcends exposition. The slat-as-bridge metaphor and museum fossil parallels demonstrate thematic heft. Subtext about preservation/decay enhances complexity without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subverts redemption tropes by avoiding absolution. Avoids purple prose; emotional nuance emerges through action (relinquishing slat). Lacks overt originality but executes human-scale drama with precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements serve narrative purpose without obvious grafting. The brief format sharpens focus on emotional crossroads. Lingering question about redemption lingers, though thematic resolution feels slightly smoothed.</comment>
