<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Develops Marcus's dual identity effectively but lacks deeper exploration of his internal conflict between duty and rebellion; motivation is consistent but underdeveloped beyond surface-level contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; action drives plot purposefully, though pacing slightly falters in transition between discovery and placement of cameo; abrupt closure feels artificial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imaginative setting undermined by generic sensory details; atmosphere builds mood effectively but lacks tactile/smell elements that could deepen immersion; miniature scale could be exploited further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Richly symbolic with layered metaphors; subtext about curatorial control vs. subversive truth resonates; ending lingers suggestively; emotional nuance shown through actions rather than explicit statements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through inventive object use but contains occasional florid phrasing ("crushing lullaby of conformity"); emotional stakes remain surface-level despite effective atmospheric subtleties.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Elements feel deliberate yet cohesive; some assigned components (orchard timing) less integral; thematic resonance strong despite minor artificiality in plot mechanics; leaves lingering questions about institutional power.</comment>
