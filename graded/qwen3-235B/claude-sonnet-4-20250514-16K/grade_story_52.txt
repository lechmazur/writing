<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: Mira's devotion shapes her actions with emotional weight. Weakness: Motivation lacks psychological complexity; Jasper's forgiveness feels abrupt despite implied history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Time limit creates urgency; duet resolves emotional arc cleanly. Weakness: Coincidences (spotting Jasper organically, synchronized singing) strain plausibility in the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: Hourglass setting creates unique visual logic. Weakness: Fading chalk lines underused as both metaphor and practical device; sensory details often abstract rather than evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors (sand/time, broken sharpener/devotion) add depth. Weakness: Emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown (e.g., "blithe discontent"); ending risks sentimentality over substance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strength: Hourglass conceit original. Weakness: Karaoke confession risks clich√©; overreliance on lyrical descriptors like "danced," "seared"; character reasoning occasionally simplistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Strength: Hourglass as clever time-pressure device. Weakness: Elements feel compartmentalized; cohesion between setting mechanics and emotional stakes uneven.</comment>
