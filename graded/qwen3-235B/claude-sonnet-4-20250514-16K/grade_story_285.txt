<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's hesitancy and motivation to restore traditions are consistently shown through specific actions, but emotional depth and complexity remain underdeveloped. The postcard's connection to his motivation is strong, but internal conflicts feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ritual arc with strong cause-and-effect momentum. The tight word limit constrains development but maintains coherence. Pacing aligns with the ceremonial process, though spirit emergence lacks tension to complement the high stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frozen orchard with geothermal vents creates a striking contrast effectively. Sensory details (steam, brittle air, glowing postcard) immerse readers. The setting meaningfully supports the theme of duality and ritual. Atmosphere is masterfully rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story uses metaphors (crabs/spirits, brittle shells/postcard) skillfully to convey subtext about transition. Ending avoids sentimentality while feeling emotionally complete. The central conflict of tradition vs. modernity is conceptually rich but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing but relies on bureaucratic vs. mystical duality without fully subverting it. Descriptions are painterly but occasionally over-ornate ("ephemeral rancor" feels conceptually prioritized over human nuance). Emotional progression leans lightly stated rather than deeply shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified narrative with deliberate stylistic choices. Story's brevity enhances its symbolism, though deeper exploration of the magic system or bureaucracy could strengthen it further. Ends on a resonant, imagery-driven note.</comment>
