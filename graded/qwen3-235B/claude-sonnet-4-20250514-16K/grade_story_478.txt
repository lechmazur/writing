<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's secrecy and role as midwife create tension, but motivation remains abstract; actions align with traits but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ritual-seeking propels the arc, with cause/effect tied to diary fragments; pacing feels compressed but coherent, though resolution leans on mystical vagueness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Banshee-like maelstrom contrasts with moonlit orchard's stillness; sensory details (smoldering herbs, groaning trees) immerse without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "dissonant calm") and symbolic herb-lore resonate beyond plot mechanics; subtext about female knowledge suppression elevates thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Worldbuilding cohesion and atmospheric tone justify the elements, though character depth falters; ending achieves lyrical ambiguity without glib resolution.</grade>
