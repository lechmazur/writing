<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's drive to preserve the academy ties to her role as a "sincere rebel," but her internal conflict lacks nuanced, grounded motivations; her connection to the legacy feels more archetypal than deeply personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear path but struggles with pacing conciseness: the transition from discovery to revelation feels abrupt, and the emotional payoff hinges too abruptly on textual exposition rather than gradual buildup within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The haunted passage’s shifting walls and sensory details (copper taste, watching portraits, dynamic symbols) create visceral unease, while the storm-saturated timeframe amplifies tension through environmental symbolism rather than feeling arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "language of preservation") and evocative imagery convey layered themes of legacy vs. destruction, though the ending leans on clichéd "coming home" resolution rather than subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Originality elevates this above generic haunted-building tropes, but occasional overreliance on phrases like "malevolent life" and "whispered prayers" edges toward predictable Gothic flourishes rather than fresh, precise language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story’s tight weaving of atmosphere and character purpose suggests deliberate intent, though its brevity leaves some thematic threads underexplored, particularly regarding intergenerational responsibility and institutional erasure.</comment>
