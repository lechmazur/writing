<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character feels plot-mechanic-driven; motivations lack psychological depth beyond thematic necessity. Obsession with cipher is stated rather than dramatized through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Thin word-limit execution; coincidences create artificial forward motion but lack organic buildup. Resolution feels rushed despite thematic bookending. Uneven pacing between expository blocks and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Vivid but occasionally garish imagery; suburban kitchen vs tar pit juxtaposition works, but atmospheric elements (shifting shadows, chrysalis timing) strain plausibility as symbolic mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors connect (butterfly/metamorphosis = transformation through grief). Ending creates resonant echo with "desperate hope" becoming "wings." Some lyrical overreach weakens impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original cipher mechanics undercut by formulaic archetypes. Kinship "web" concept and "watchtowers" borrow heavily from Gothic tropes. Sensory details occasionally generic ("shifting shadows," "warm coin").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist items rather than organically integrated components. The 3-month backstory feels imposed. Final revelation is emotionally resonant but conceptually undercooked for literary standards.</comment>
