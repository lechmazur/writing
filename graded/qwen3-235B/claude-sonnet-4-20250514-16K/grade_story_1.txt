<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's phobias serve narrative but remain underexplored; motivation for obsession with hidden libraries feels abrupt despite surface-level connection to "edge of madness" concept. Shift to fearlessness lacks psychological depth. Dialogue absence eliminates voice assessment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but relies on contrived coincidences (garage sale envelope leading to pyramid). Pacing feels compressed; knot-unraveling climax lacks buildup. Connection between phobias and "triumph" resolves too tidily for credibility, disrupting logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral descriptions of dust, collapsing net, and multilingual echoes create immersive tension. Contrasts (claustrophobia vs. agoraphobia) enhance atmosphere. Sensory details occasionally veer into overwrought metaphor but mostly succeed in cementing desert/pyramid mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Echoes as spiritual communication provide subtext about fear vs. enlightenment. Ending's revelation feels earned through gradual knot-unraveling metaphors. Overly neat thematic symmetry (phobias = spiritual sensitivity) undercuts nuance. Strong balance of showing vs. telling maintains engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Mixed success avoiding clich√©s: "forgotten library" trope diluted by pyramid setting's overuse. Some fresh metaphors (e.g. "internal acrobatics") undercut by mechanical phrases like "suffocating darkness." Emotions primarily demonstrated through actions rather than explicit statements, though final revelation borders on expositional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but strain under scrutiny. The stunt double premise never fully intersects with library quest; phobia descriptions occasionally feel arbitrary. Brief length sacrifices emotional stakes but creates deliberate mystique. Lingering question about spirituality vs. delusion offers intellectual resonance.</comment>
