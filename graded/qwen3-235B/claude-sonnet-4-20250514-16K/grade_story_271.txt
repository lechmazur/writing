<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's strange nature and motivation are established but lack deeper exploration; interactions with the child are poignant but underdeveloped, leaving emotional stakes thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently in tight structure with clear beginning-middle-end, but the storm-as-metaphor and abrupt thematic resolution feel slightly contrived within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere through specific sensory details (decaying organs, spices) and contrasts between grotesque setting and human resilience; tone enhances theme effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through subtext and symbolism (juggling as defiance), but dialogue occasionally states themes too directly, undercutting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in juxtaposing grotesque elements with childlike wonder, but relies on familiar tropes (abandoned lab, wise child) and occasionally ornate phrasing distracts from narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>Story feels purposefully concise but leans on familiar imagery and overly tidy thematic parallels; leaves a lingering impression but lacks lasting complexity.</grade>
