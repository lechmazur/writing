<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation and action are largely coherent, but Elena's internal life remains underdeveloped beyond her function as avenger. The "eagerly jaded" attribute feels superficially applied to her observational role rather than deeply integrated into her psychological makeup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure demonstrates efficient use of constraints, but exposition overload in early paragraphs disrupts pacing. The payoff feels earned but the rushed escalation omits emotional beats that might elevate the climax from theatrical to profound.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid visual elements and symbolic contrasts (sanctuary/intercom) create palpable atmosphere, though auditory elements remain underexplored in a setting defined by silence and sound reproduction through recordings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., phones as "tarot cards") and thematic tension between illusion/reality elevate the storytelling. The metaphor of performance works on multiple levels, though some metaphors verge on overuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Subverts medical conspiracy trope through the grandmother's legacy and narrative performance, but relies on familiar narrative of institutional corruption. Characterization occasionally prioritizes symbolism over realistic psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion with clever elemental integration, though thematic connections to mortality and performance feel occasionally forced. The narrative punch lingers, but some assigned elements operate in service of plot mechanics rather than emotional truth.</comment>
