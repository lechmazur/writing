<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's reserved nature is implied through actions and setting, but deeper inner conflict or dimensionality is underexplored. Motivation aligns with actions but lacks emotional complexity or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression from discovery to preservation, but compressed arc feels rushed in emotional payoff and thematic gestation. Pacing prioritizes poetic moments over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Richly textured setting (laboratory's forgotten sounds vs. choir's living harmonies) creates evocative contrasts. Integration of tactile details (peeled wallpaper, embroidered threads) deepens atmosphere, though temporal framework during choir practice remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors ("cultural DNA," threads as "artistic resurrection") elevate craft. Emotional resonance is present but occasionally relies on generalized poeticism rather than specific human-scale conflict. Theme of preservation is consistent but under-embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original premise and sensory specificity (whispers as curatorial objects, acoustic interplay) showcase human insight. Some phrases ("whispers found sanctuary") verge on ornamental abstraction, but core invention transcends formulaic structures.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story demonstrates cohesion but risks preciousness through thematic overalignment. Uses word constraints effectively but sacrifices visceral immediacy for lyrical abstraction. Leaves intellectual impressions rather than emotional residue.</comment>
