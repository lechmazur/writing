<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to heal others while grieving is clear, but emotional nuances are underdeveloped. Actions align with traits, but distinct voice lacks sufficient depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from task to ritual, but the tight word limit leaves the arc feeling abbreviated. Cause-effect relationships are mostly clear but lack tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with strong sensory details, though the "cloud-wreathed temple" leans on familiar mystical tropes. Setting reinforces theme but could deepen its uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "language of the heart" resonate, and ending achieves emotional texture. Subtext is present but occasionally undercut by overt exposition and slight melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but stumbles into ornate phrasing ("doleful cheer") and generalized emotional descriptors. Style feels purposeful but occasionally strains under verbose imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven, though some (binder clip, lace pattern) feel more essential than others ("temple in clouds"). Leverages assigned constraints with creativity but lacks breakthrough ingenuity.</comment>
