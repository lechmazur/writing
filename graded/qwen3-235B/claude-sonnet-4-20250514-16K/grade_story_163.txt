<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sturdy external motivations (inheritance, duty) shown, but emotional depth beneath "bitter optimism" feels surface-textured; choices are decisive but self-understanding remains intellectual rather than viscerally felt</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plotted with elegant cause-effect (detour→overlook→realization→solution), but compressed pacing creates logical gaps (elegant "unification device" handwavium) and diminishes tension from high stakes</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (crystalline formations, bioluminescent rhythms) immerse readers; cloud entities as both threat and wonder enhance existential mood through cosmic-scale atmosphere</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of fragmented dimensions mirroring personal disintegration succeeds; ending's quiet triumph resonates thematically, though emotional payoff lacks subtlety (e.g., explicitly stating "no longer lost")</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids total genre clichés through creative repurposing of mundane "parking stub," but occasional purple prose ("reality coming apart at the seams") undercuts atmospheric tension with familiar phrasing</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into functional narrative machine, particularly strong in thematic unity between character inheritance and cosmic stakes, though some mechanical creaks visible in worldbuilding seams</comment>
