<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation as "fierceness" lacks emotional depth; actions serve thematic goals more than organic character behavior. Shows glimmers of nuance but defaults to symbolic representation over psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elegantly interconnected narrative threads but lacks traditional plot momentum; the 400-500 word format serves atmosphere better than narrative development. Conceptual cohesion compensates for minimal dramatic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Masterful sensory alchemy creates palpable decay and longing; setting isn't just backdrop but active participant in thematic exploration. The drowned world's texture almost compensates for narrative vagueness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Profound conceptual resonance between form and theme; metaphors strike with surgical precision. Emotional distance undermines visceral power despite sophisticated craftsmanship. The haunting tone lingers but feels detached.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Largely avoids genre traps through surreal execution but stumbles into abstraction-heavy passages. Some tropes (dystopian prophets) are revitalized through precise imagery rather than invention. Stylistic risks mostly pay off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Excellent conceptual skeleton exists but narrative muscles lack complete density; elements serve theme but strain under closer inspection. Leaves conceptual residue but feels more like an aesthetic fragment than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
