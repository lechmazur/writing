<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation connects past and present but feels archetypal; Marcus's actions align with his "forgotten once" trauma yet lack psychological depth or inner conflict beyond surface determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Linear plot functions efficiently within constraints, but the marbles' quantum sleuthing strains credibility; emotional resolution feels abrupt despite satisfying surface arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid neon-drenched imagery anchors the setting, but sensory details overload on visual elements while neglecting tactile/olfactory immersion that could elevate atmosphere beyond genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of analog relics against digital decay carries thematic resonance; ending tilts toward sentimentality rather than earned emotional impact, undercutting potential for haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrases (e.g., "world perpetually on fire") veer into tech-noir clich√©; marbles-as-quantum-devices concept shows ingenuity but occasionally reads as arbitrary fusion of retro/future aesthetics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story leverages assigned elements cohesively but safely; delivers solid genre execution without transcending into the conceptual daring required for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
