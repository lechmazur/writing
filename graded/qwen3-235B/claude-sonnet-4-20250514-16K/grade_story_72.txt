<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Envoy's sneer and "furiously tranquil" resolve shape his demeanor but lack psychological depth; motivation to uncover conspiracy implied through actions, but personal stakes remain opaque; reactions to notes and revelation hint at inner conflict but feel underdeveloped in tight word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through paper trail as physical and metaphorical driver; sifting action initiates discovery, but revelation feels compressed; beginning/middle/end arc exists but lacks emotional payoff; causal links logical but execution rushed in critical moments like decision-making.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alien vineyard's sensory details (glowing fruit, synthetic soil, swirling leaves) create richly atmospheric microcosm; setting meaningfully connected to weaponized starlight concept; time frame's "hush" contrasts with cosmic stakes, though occasionally overwritten.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical language ("cup starlight," "sift through ashes") and thematic resonance of cosmic responsibility; ending avoids pat resolution while deepening ethical tension; balances show/tell effectively despite lyrical density; leaves philosophical questions lingering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality emerges in pairing bureaucratic "paper trails" with esoteric science; metaphors like "rambling destiny" avoid clich√©, though some phrases ("dusty silence") verge on generic; character psychology has nuance but occasionally leans on tropish "lone investigator" scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story sacrifices character depth for conceptual ambition, yet maintains cohesion through symbolic objects; limited word count used inventively for worldbuilding; twist reframes expectations effectively while adhering to elements; voice remains distinct but occasionally inconsistent in tone.</comment>
