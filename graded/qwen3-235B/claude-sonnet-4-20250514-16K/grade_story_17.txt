<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character displays clear motivation shift, but self-realization feels slightly rushed; internal conflict is compellingly rendered through concrete actions and environmental parallels.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, cohesive atmosphere merges gothic decay with bureaucratic melancholy; sensory details (dust motes, chipped bowl) create haunting immediacy that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphoric language ("carved guilt deep into his bones") and layered subtext enhance thematic complexity; ending earns its emotional weight through careful setup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent solemnity without veering into melodrama; some phrases ("brazen modesty") risk affectation but serve character establishment; emotional nuance feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central metaphor of historical reconciliation; style enhances rather than obscures meaning; condensed format works as narrative strength rather than limitation.</comment>
