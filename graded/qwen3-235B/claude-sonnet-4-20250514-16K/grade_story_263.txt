<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are hinted at but insufficiently explored; the zealotry feels underdeveloped despite nuanced self-doubt and strong symbolic connection to the plush. Voice is distinctive but inconsistent in emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves internal coherence through symbolic progression, but lacks narrative momentum; the consolidation of the epic serves as thematic backbone rather than plot driver, creating a static quality despite clear beginning/middle/end structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is lush and immersive, with sensory details anchoring moral themes; coral formations and bioluminescence create atmosphere that mirrors character psychology, though some descriptions verge on excessive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphorical imagery (reflections, dissolving plush) elevates thematic depth; the inversion trope and haunting ending provoke philosophical resonance, though emotional beats occasionally lean on abstraction rather than concrete action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids major AI telltales with specific imagery and tonal unpredictability; some symbolic repetition borders on heavy-handedness but maintains freshness through inventive metaphors and psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements function interdependently with minor friction; the constrained length enhances thematic compression, though pacing inconsistencies and underutilized "reversed echoes" slightly undermine cohesion.</comment>
