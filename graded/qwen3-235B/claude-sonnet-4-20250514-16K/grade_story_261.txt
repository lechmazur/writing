<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kaya’s immortality and resentment toward artificial nature are clear but underdeveloped; her emotional depth relies more on thematic resonance than fully realized interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from discovery to transformation, but the ink-to-mandala pivot feels slightly rushed; the ending implies resolution without fully earned momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vividly evocative setting contrasting organic decay and synthetic perfection; sensory details (synthetic trees’ hum, phantom blossoms) heighten the haunting atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as memory, mandala as rebellion) carry thematic weight; emotional impact is undercut by a few overly schematic reflections on "broken memory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction (e.g., "rigidly flexible") that verges on AI-generated abstraction without grounding in tactile details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with purpose; the story’s brevity serves its existential themes, though the transformation of the garden could feel less abrupt.</comment>
