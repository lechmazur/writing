<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elipses in internal logic; traits are stated rather than demonstrated through action, weakening the connection between her trusting nature and actual decisions. Voice remains flat; dialogue is sparse, expository, and lacks idiosyncrasy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spiral wick as plot catalyst lacks narrative weight; pacing staggers between hyper-detailed description and abrupt, underdeveloped progression toward the transformative ending. The arc collapses under the word count's pressure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flickering reflections and autumn decay create visceral atmosphere, but sensory details like candle remnants and leaf sounds are unevenly deployedâ€”sharp imagery clashes with vague, half-realized textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hollow thematic ambition ("understanding over fear") is drowned in facile metaphors. The ending's "revolution" feels manipulative, demanding emotional investment without earned catharsis. Occasional striking phrases can't compensate for flatness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (abandoned labs, cryptids, prophetic visions) without subversion. The "twist" of candles as communication channels feels rote; language dips into purple prose ("crystalline maze") and emotionally prescriptive cues.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements like mirrors and candles are checklisted into the narrative without achieving symbiosis. The compressed form highlights structural weaknesses rather than amplifying tension. Ambition overshoots execution.</comment>
