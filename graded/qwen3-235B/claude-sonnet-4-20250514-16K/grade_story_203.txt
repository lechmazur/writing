<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's stage fright and inheritance conflict anchor her motivation, but the emotional arc feels compressed within the word limit, lacking nuanced introspection beyond thematic declarations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics center on the bot's subversion and Miriam's ritual, with a coherent arc. However, the key turning moment feels abrupt, relying on symbolic resonance rather than organic buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The zero-gravity setting and orbital debris amplify isolation and decay. Effective imagery, though the connection between toys/bot behavior and the atmospheric tension remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (fractured heritage, "ashes of 'never'") and symbolic objects elevate the narrative. The ending’s thematic resolution—choosing authenticity—resonates emotionally despite its brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in merging exorcism with space horror avoids genre clichés. Some phrasing (e.g., "defiant hush") leans toward poetic abstraction, but emotional beats feel earned, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around the theme of inherited falsehoods, though the bot’s subversion via a key sound strains logic. The ending’s introspection lingers, compensating for slight structural gaps.</comment>
