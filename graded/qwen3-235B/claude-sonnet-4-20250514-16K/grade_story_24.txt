<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Poor integration of "ordinarily extraordinary" into character behavior; motivation remains abstract rather than visceral, making the bard feel conceptually constructed rather than psychologically real. Weak emotional grounding beneath ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Improvised structure mimics wandering prose rather than purposeful progression; puppet show climax lacks narrative payoff, feeling more like a static vignette than an arc. Pacing inconsistencies between atmospheric passages and plot movement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich but inconsistent sensory details - the mountain's physicality and bookish atmosphere clash momentarily with "digital confession" anachronism. Setting's thematic resonance feels half-realized in its dialogue between analog and digital decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (dentures as vessels of legacy, books as bones of the mountain) achieves poetic resonance. Some telling rather than showing in emotional beats, but overall maintains thematic momentum through evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by rhythmic sentence uniformity and occasional clich√©s ("whispers of incense"). Avoids AI tropes in concept but occasionally slips into romanticized decay of print culture without critical engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but uneven execution - some assigned elements feel bolted on (timeframe, "radiating warmth") while others form narrative backbone. Lingers emotionally but lacks textual urgency required by top-tier standards.</comment>
