<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterization reveals depth through specific emotional reckoning with guilt, but backstory exposition feels slightly heavy-handed. Motivation through familial loss is clear but could use more nuanced personality traits beyond melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has satisfying symmetry between recipe restoration and emotional growth, but pacing feels slightly uneven with rushed early setup and compressed emotional arc. Clear beginning/middle/end but with some forced cause-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport atmosphere works beautifully through specific details like "rattling chest" and "dusty viewports." The decaying technology holding culinary legacy creates effective tonal contrast and sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional core and skillful metaphor use (corrupted recipes as broken relationships), but some thematic telling undermines showing. Ending provides satisfying closure while maintaining narrative economy despite slight over-explanation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spaceport setting and culinary decay concept show ingenuity, but some descriptions approach ornate phrasing ("mechanical breathing" for machines) and emotional revelations lack unexpected psychological nuance. Avoids most clich√©s but feels somewhat familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story integrates all assigned elements cohesively despite tight word count. Style occasionally hinders clarity with elaborate phrasing but succeeds in conveying emotional throughline. Length feels appropriate rather than restrictive.</comment>
