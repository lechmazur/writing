<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya functions as a mystical cartographer but lacks psychological depth; her motivations (curiosity, devotion to gods) operate as stated facts rather than being dramatized through specific choices or internal conflict. The DJ attribute mostly serves plot mechanics rather than revealing character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing remains uneven—exposition heavy at start, then accelerates through discoveries. The sweater thread's route provides structural coherence but the "filing" framework feels underutilized. Sacred space mapping creates circular structure but resolution stays transactional rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight and endless night create haunting atmosphere where alchemical apple trees become sentient neural networks. The greenhouse transforms from mysterious setting to active participant through tremors and reality-bending alcoves. Sensory details like warm pencil cases and crystalline percussion make magic tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful poetic register with phrases like "crystalline percussion" and "divine laughter through speakers" elevates the mystical. However, some lyrical abstraction risks disconnecting readers from emotional beats. The ending's documenting ritual suggests tension between order and chaos as underlying theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate description ("phosphorescent moths behind eyelids") that prioritizes aesthetics over narrative propulsion. The sweater thread as guide borders on trope-like but redeems through physicality (tugging wrist). Subverts expectations by framing god communication through DJing rather than traditional ritual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excellence anchors the story, but thin character dimensionality and episodic plotting reduce overall impact. The synthesis of filing systems with divine mapping is conceptually daring yet insufficiently grounded in human stakes. Ends with closure rather than resonant thematic catharsis.</comment>
