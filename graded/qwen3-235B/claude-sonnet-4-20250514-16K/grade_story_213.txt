<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations feel imposed rather than developed through meaningful interiority or nuanced action. Frustration with bureaucracy is stated, not earned through humanizing contradictions or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot executes a clean arc but skips over crucial transitions. The decisive action feels abrupt rather than inevitable, with insufficient setup for Elena’s radical shift from observer to saboteur within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere mixes intriguing elements (glowing plants, outdated solar panels) but relies on vague descriptors rather than specific sensory immersion. Contrast between scientific and celebratory tones works conceptually but lacks emotional or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong conceptual payoff in using solar shutdown as metaphor for paradigm shifts. Uneven emotional impact; relies too heavily on declarative statements ("This is the sunrise…") rather than subtle thematic embodiment through character decisions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Concepts are imaginative but execution shows signs of formulaic construction—underdeveloped internal conflict, over-reliance on binary oppositions (science/tradition, old/new), and occasionally artificial diction ("photosynthetic poetry").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story has structural competence but feels conceptually safe. Elements coexist without fully transforming one another—wedding setting lacks thematic integration, and the core idea of rewriting narratives remains more literal than profound.</comment>
