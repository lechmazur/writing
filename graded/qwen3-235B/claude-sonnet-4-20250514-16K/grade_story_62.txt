<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Minimal character development beyond symbolic representation; motivation (rewriting reality's code) is clear but inconsistently tied to tangible actions beyond abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear, episodic structure lacking traditional arc but conveying thematic progression; atmospheric stasis outweighs plot momentum, though coherence persists.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich decay imagery and twilight setting enhance mood, but sensory details occasionally trend toward vague "decadence" without distinct ecological texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking symbolic interplay between broken cup and philosophical inquiry elevates thematic resonance, though meta-commentary on meaning-making verges on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pervasive decay motifs and paradoxical honesty/deceit avoid formulaic existentialism; some phrases ("sorrow rewrote reality") risk abstract vagueness typical of algorithmic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Intelligent conceptual scaffolding supports poetic ambiguity, though excessive emphasis on metaphor over lived-in detail prevents full transcendence.</comment>
