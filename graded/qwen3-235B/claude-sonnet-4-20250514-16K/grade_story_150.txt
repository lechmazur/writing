<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Jeremiah's outlaw poet identity feels largely symbolic rather than deeply integrated; motivations shift toward cosmic destiny without sufficient emotional grounding, and Elena's role lacks psychological nuance despite the intertwined fates premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between shifting wall texts creates thematic momentum but weakens structural coherence; the rehearsal arc resolves too abstractly to satisfy as a miniature narrative, leaning on poetic ambiguity over plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The steampunk café setting's sensory details (brass gears, copper steam) create vivid immersion, though the 'observatory' aspect remains underexploited; atmosphere excels but occasionally overwhelms spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("wall text as destiny," dice as metaphysical disruptors) elevate the tale, but emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral; the ending's cosmic finality lacks lingering emotional residue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction ("saturated ambivalence"), diluting focus; some phrases ("small graves in his palm") achieve poetic precision, but tonal consistency wavers between pulp-western and metaphysical surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragments of originality shine—the concept of mutable destiny via mutable text—but the narrative structure leans too heavily on atmospheric flourishes rather than integrating all elements into a unified thematic engine.</comment>
