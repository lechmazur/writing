<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters possess surface-level motivations; Vera's metaphor-centric dialogue reveals depth but Malik's internalization lacks nuance. Their history is hinted at but insufficiently explored given the constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically within tight word limits, but the transition to the secret room feels abrupt. The arc resolves neatly, though cause-effect between Malik's nomadic traits and the climax requires more connective tissue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded cliffs and garishly lit disguise room create striking contrasts, but the surreal elements (barbell motif, tech-infused cave) occasionally clash. Sensory details are vivid yet inconsistently prioritized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractured barbells as recklessness, fog as confusion) are purposeful. Dialogue-driven character revelation and symbolic setting create thematic cohesion. Subtext about wisdom/overreach resonates, though emotional beats could be more subtly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but contains slightly over-polished lines ("wisdom rather than block our path"). Some metaphors fresh, others generic ("echo of footsteps"). Character reasoning occasionally strains plausibility under minimalist constraints.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate well enough to sustain the theme, but certain combinations (spy room in mountain trail) feel arbitrary rather than organic. The ending provides thematic closure without feeling fully earned, though the mist/dawn imagery lingers.</comment>
