<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character remains conceptually abstract; motivations (preserving relic vs. emotional restoration) lack nuanced internal conflict; actions often feel like thematic gestures rather than psychologically grounded choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear symbolic arc from object discovery to existential decision, but momentum stumbles under compressed philosophical abstraction; cause-effect between veil's discovery and ideological resolution feels tenuously implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere achieves chilling sublimity through tactile details: shifting ice as emotional void metaphor, preserved tears as scientific artifacts, and veil's "ghostly weight" all create immersive existential coldness that transcends mere setting decoration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose wields precision-blade imagery and paradoxical metaphors ("rationally organic mathematics") to craft haunting emotional resonance; ending's thematic synthesis - beauty requiring pain's courage - lingers as paradoxical wisdom rather than didactic assertion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through scientific-poetic fusion, but occasionally indulges in ornamental abstraction ("crystal shadows" recurred to formulaic effect); emotional restoration via snowflakes maintains conceptual freshness even as some metaphors verge on overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into philosophical parable rather than conventional narrative; while individual components (veil, lighthouse, fear-idol) resonate, the whole occasionally feels like curated art installation pieces rather than organic storytelling construction.</comment>
