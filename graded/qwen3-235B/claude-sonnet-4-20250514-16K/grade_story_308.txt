<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Contradictions (executioner vs. preserver) are well-balanced. Shyness manifests meaningfully through physical gestures (keychain fumbling, deep bow), but emotional layers beyond redemption feel underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Three-act structure exists within limits: demonstration catalyzes growth, but the transition from internal conflict to physical embodiment lacks specific beats (e.g., hesitation mechanics). Sunset closure is satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marine atmosphere dominates through kinetic descriptions (rocking pontoons, tide-lapping, dancers' connection to currents). Sunlight through plastic keychain and tactile details (weathered hands on bamboo) elevate immersion beyond mere seashell clich√©s.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Subtext of cultural preservation as both exorcism and rebirth shines. "Cheap plastic dignified" and "destruction/renewal" duality create thematic resonance. Ending risks sentimentality but saves itself through physical artifacts (notes, keychain).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While avoiding genre tropes, some phrases ("new performers," "relentless current") skim toward generality. The "storm-to-sunrise" smile metaphor feels slightly worn, but Kael's wordless transformation maintains psychological credibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements function as thematic threads, not checklist boxes. The ending's focus on documented steps-as-victory rather than live performance innovation feels intentional, suggesting deeper worldbuilding beyond the page.</comment>
