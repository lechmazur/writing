<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conflict between duty and rebellion is clear but psychological depth feels surface-level; motivations are logical but transitions lack nuanced introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows coherent arc with clear stakes, but pivotal revelations (Zara's connection to manuscripts) arrive too abruptly; pacing uneven in compressed space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ethereal setting evoked via crystalline cores and floating islands, but many sensory details (e.g., "desperate sincerity") lack tangible physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic tension between preservation and progress; poetic metaphors ("island tilt"), but emotional beats rely on predictable phrases like "desperate sincerity."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids generic fantasy tropes with mist pools and star maps, but phrases like "responding to ancient resonances" verge on overwritten; moral conflict feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story coheres with all elements present, but integration feels dutiful rather than inspired; lush prose occasionally obscures narrative momentum.</comment>
