<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character actions align with traits, but motivations beyond duty remain underdeveloped. The "lonely ringleader" trait manifests contextually rather than through emotional depth, leaving Marcus feeling more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates cohesion within constraints, with rising tension and clear stakes. However, the conclusion feels abrupt and underexplored, sacrificing potential resolution for atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (cramped booth, red velvet, temperature shifts) create vivid atmosphere. The zero-gravity flame enhances unease but occasionally veers into fantastical rather than believably eerie.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric tension and symbolic use of the flame enhance impact. Emotional resonance is undercut by a reliance on familiar horror tropes rather than subverting them for deeper thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√© but leans heavily on familiar ghost-hunting frameworks. The zero-gravity flame and ancestral napkin offer original touches, though emotional beats lack sufficient nuance to feel fully authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>Elements combine into functional narrative, but the story leans more on atmosphere than thematic ambition. Certain required components (e.g., "commonly individual mediums") feel imposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>
