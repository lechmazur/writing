<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wealth of background details but limited emotional interiority; motivation implied through artifacts rather than visceral engagement. Obsession explained but not fully felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resolution but compressed pacing creates plot leaps; transformation of space feels abrupt despite coherent structural logic. Arc present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensorial immersion in temple's tactile decay and ghostly resonance; atmosphere masterfully reinforces theme of buried secrets resurfacing. Setting itself functions as silent character.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrases ("symphonies of truth," "spaces between heartbeats") border on pretentious, but overall voice demonstrates distinctive vision. Avoids major tropes through unorthodox object relationships.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Competent integration of assignments but lacks transcendent cohesion; thematic resonance present yet diluted by narrative concision constraints. Leaves intellectual impression rather than emotional imprint.</comment>
