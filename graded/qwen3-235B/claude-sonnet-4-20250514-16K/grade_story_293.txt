<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's desperation and inherited resolve are clear, but emotional nuance feels generalized. Motivation (sister's disappearance) drives action, but inner conflict remains surface-level through overused "yearning for freedom" tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plotted with visual momentum but sacrifices structural rigor for poetic imagery. The beacon-deployment action resolves through mystical musical-bacterial harmonics unconvincing under scrutiny, though creates visceral catharsis within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bacterial city's organic glow creates memorably alien ambiance, but biotechnology logic remains decorative rather than integratedâ€”the living walls' sentience doesn't organically impact character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors of artificial performances vs authentic revelation resonate powerfully. Final line's symbolic "humming lute" delivers thematic resonance, though overt declarations ("hunger for escaping the ordinary") undermine subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like "phosphorescent air" dazzle but coexist with generative-sounding abstractions ("desperate hunger"). Tension between conformity and rebellion is genuine, but character psychology follows familiar arcs without deepening.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Packaging genre elements into a cohesive emotional journey succeeds technically, but lacks the radical reimagining required to transcend "inspirational rebellion" templates. Premise outshines thematic follow-through.</comment>
