<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but psychological depth is occasionally superficial; Elena's internal conflict is well-established but her transformation feels slightly accelerated, relying on thematic resonance over nuanced emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure shows strong handling of the compressed arc, with the bus journey creating narrative spine. However, the conclusion's thematic leap from starling patterns to human cooperation feels slightly rushed in the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through crystalline walls and starling imagery, but the eerie element of the salt mine remains underexploredâ€”some sensory description relies on expected adjectives rather than uniquely observed details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor use (starlings as collective intelligence, salt mine as reclaimed space) elevates thematic cohesion. The final metaphor equating emotional migration to birds' flight feels poetically resonant but slightly over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic writing, with distinctive metaphors and subtle emotional subtext. Occasional phrases ('liberalize the human spirit') verge on abstraction but remain grounded through specific imagery like the malfunctioning 'E' key.</comment>
