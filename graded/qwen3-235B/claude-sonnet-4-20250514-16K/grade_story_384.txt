<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Marco's motivation to expose fraud is consistent, but his role as a frantic cook lacks depth; his access to archives and expertise in decoding historical data strains plausibility. Psychological nuance is minimal, relying on external plot mechanics rather than organic character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Oscillates between atmospheric setup and hurried resolution. The inciting discovery is strong, but pivotal moments (cross-referencing data, preparing evidence) occur off-screen. The through-line between Marco's culinary role and investigative actions remains logically tenuous despite concise framing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Seismometers, dust-laden archives, and humming machines create tactile unease. Sensory details like "centuries of particles" and mechanical innocence of seismographs juxtapose scientific order with hidden chaos. Atmospheric cohesion falters when connecting Marco's kitchen duties to archival sleuthing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors linking carved notches to suppressed truths and seismic "innocence" versus human manipulation create thematic resonance. The ending's tension between individual revelation and institutional collapse lingers, though emotional weight is undercut by underdeveloped stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Subverts "whistleblower" tropes by making protagonist a peripheral outsider, but leans on familiar conspiracy archetypes (hidden manuscripts, generational cover-ups). Sensory descriptions and symbolic objects (walking stick as palimpsest) avoid generic excess but occasionally veer into arch stylization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual cleverness outpaces execution. Assigned elements form a structural skeleton, but seams show in how they're grafted together (e.g., pencil eraser as passive tool, cook's role minimally interrogated). Raises provocative questions about scientific integrity, but momentum is diffused by uneven pacing.</comment>
