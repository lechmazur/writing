<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's "assertive meekness" remains undefined; motivation to escape is clear but lacks emotional depth. Actions (solving via intention-writing) inconsistently blend meekness and determination. Dialogue absence limits voice development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive structure but overly reliant on contrivance (tapestry's sudden responsiveness). Pacing feels rushed in critical 400-word arc. Cause-effect logic (card ≠ digital system) lacks foundational explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting has vivid digital-desert contrasts but sensory details are uneven (touch emphasized via card/threads, other senses underdeveloped). Atmosphere leans on tech-jargon rather than immersive authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (human heart vs. code) work but lack surprise. Theme of analog humanity resisting digital perfection is clear but superficial. Ending resolves conflict cleanly but avoids ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Contains purple prose ("impossible perfection," "desperate optimism") and overly precise descriptors. Relies on clichéd tech-gone-rogue premise. "Xenialize" introduction feels like arbitrary neologism rather than thematic core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements function but lack synergy. The greeting card and tapestry integration feels forced; "small-town" detail irrelevant. Message about tech has surface resonance but lacks narrative transcendence.</comment>
