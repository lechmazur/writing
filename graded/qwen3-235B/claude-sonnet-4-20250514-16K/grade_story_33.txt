<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistently portrays Eleanor's internal conflict but lacks deeper exploration of her past; dialogue could better reflect her distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nonviolent resolution aligns with arc but relies on abrupt epiphany; cosmic blink's narrative significance feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between sterile office and organic chaos (mask, birds) create strong atmosphere; cosmic timeframe remains loosely integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (birds/leaves, mask/reflections) deepen theme; subtext about classification vs. natural order resonates; ending avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s (e.g., "braided bitterness" feels purposeful) but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing ("splintered relationship with order").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive symbolism unites disparate elements; cosmic blink and office setting could be more conceptually integrated for greater impact.</comment>
