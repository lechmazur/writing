<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Edgar’s mortician professionalism and curiosity are consistent, but his depth remains surface-level; motivations are clear but not intricately tied to his profession beyond the premise. The wrist bracelet adds mysticism but lacks emotional anchoring to his past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clean arc, but resolution feels abrupt—the handoff of journals lacks emotional payoff. Pacing is steady, yet the story’s brevity leaves the central conflict (collecting vs. releasing) underexplored. Shifts between wonder and revelation are smooth but thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and original, with lyrical details (brackish water, luminous fog, singing spirits) creating a transcendent mood. Sensory descriptions are vivid, though the mangrove setting’s connection to “footprints vanishing” is underutilized thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story’s metaphor of spirits as “librarians” is poignant, and the ending’s lullaby motif resonates. However, emotional impact relies heavily on lyrical prose rather than character-driven subtext. The theme of honoring dreams is clear but not philosophically probing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious but occasionally overwritten (“loudly serene,” “funeral director’s composure transforming into something wilder”). Some phrases veer into poetic abstraction without emotional payoff. The bracelet’s pulsing as a plot device feels contrived, and “polite anarchy” is stated without integration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements like the bracelet and vanished footprints hint at cohesion but aren’t fully exploited for thematic depth. The brevity is purposeful but leaves the central message (dreams as legacy) feeling undercooked rather than profound.</comment>
