<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's zealotry feels abstract; motivations lack visceral grounding despite symbolic gestures. Emotional resonance is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent but static arc; tension between legacy and discovery exists conceptually rather than through active narrative progression. Plot relies heavily on reflective epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in artifacts (smells, textures) anchor the atmosphere effectively. Setting merges science and history skillfully but politically charged context remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (chaos patterns = human sacrifice) elevate the narrative. Ending's thematic clarity lands well, though some emotional beats verge on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fresh conceptual fusion of math and legacy undercut by occasionally inflated prose ("rustic refinement," "oddly typical"). Nuanced emotional shading could counterbalance intellectual abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock conceptually but lack friction between components. Strong thematic cohesion at expense of narrative momentum; feels meticulously constructed rather than organically unfolding.</comment>
