<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character development effectively reveals layers beneath Kazuki's arrogance through tangible connections to the tapestry and song, but his internal transformation relies slightly too heavily on nostalgia rather than nuanced psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot executes a clear arc within the word limit, but the shift from defiance to submission feels accelerated. The ceremonial authorization functions technically but doesn't fully explore bureaucratic or communal resistance to Kazuki's redemption.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant visual contrast between calligraphy's serenity and bloodstained swordplay establishes mood. Sensory details like ink viscosity and armor weight could be more consistently rendered to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (armor/shackles/ink) resonate powerfully. Subtext about inherited traditions versus violent ambition emerges elegantly. The ending's symbolic merging of warrior and artist avoids mawkishness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some lyrical phrases border on excessive ("shackled potential cracked the armor around his heart"), but emotional beats are mostly shown through actions (trembling hands, broken voice) rather than direct description. Subtler cultural specifics could combat minor genericness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements work symbioticallyâ€”no single component feels extraneous. The brevity enhances emotional immediacy rather than limiting it. Could push further in interrogating cyclical violence in warrior traditions.</comment>
