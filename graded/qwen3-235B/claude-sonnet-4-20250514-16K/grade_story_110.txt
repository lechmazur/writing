<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivations are consistent but underexplored. The "quietly flamboyant" gestures and eulogy writing are intriguing but feel more decorative than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Meandering structure with strong cyclical framing but minimal forward momentum. The poison, eulogy, and lantern interactions drive coherence, but the compressed word count flattens dramatic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative decay motifs (lantern moss, ticking clock) masterfully reinforce thematic concerns. Sensory immersion is deliberate and layered, though some descriptions risk overdone macabre aesthetics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sophisticated use of metaphor (timepieces/deaths) and chilling irony elevates the narrative. The closing line lands with memorable force, though subtext occasionally veers into overwritten pretension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eulogy-writing avoids genre clich√©s, but "delicate work" and "living reminder" phrases flirt with AI-style abstraction. Motivations have surface uniqueness but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements work in unison, but slight preciousness in tone and concept undermines market readiness. The timepiece-assassination link is inspired, though the narrative risks stylistic overkill.</comment>
