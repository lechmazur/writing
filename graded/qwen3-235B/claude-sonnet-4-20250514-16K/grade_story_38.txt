<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakened by underexplored motivations and inconsistent reactions; the insomnia and botanical heritage shape her passive observation but fail to fully dictate her decisive actions. The transition from haunted observer to activist lacks emotional escalation. Third-generation trauma is hinted but shallowly rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on drunken confession as deus ex machina. The subway framing device offers structural symmetry but feels artificially imposed rather than organically integrated. Resolution is abrupt, with underdeveloped plan to burn notes feeling rushed within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich attic atmosphere anchors the narrative, with oppressive shelves and whispering shadows creating effective unease. Subway setting provides necessary contrast but remains underutilized. Sensory details uneven - strong visual descriptions undercut by neglected tactile/smell elements crucial to botanical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., "empty abundance") and subtle subtext about legacy corruption elevate the piece. Emotional impact is diluted by occasional overstatement ("desperate ghosts"). The ending's thematic resonance is undercut by predictable resolution to "burn everything" trope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Haunted attic/botanical villainy tropes executed with minimal subversion. The "poison as amplifier of existing traits" concept has potential but is mechanically applied rather than deeply explored. Prose alternates between vivid ("coffee-stained notebooks") and generic ("whispered warnings"). Spiritual themes feel derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Element checklist fulfilled but unevenly integrated. The haunted botanicals and subway framing create intriguing tension, but contrived connections between assigned elements (e.g., insomnia enabling eavesdropping) strain credibility. The final act's thematic clarity doesn't fully overcome early disjointedness.</comment>
