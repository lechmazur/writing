<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are deeply rooted in loss and vengeance, but emotional nuance beyond grief feels underexplored. The chopstick ritual is compelling yet risks reducing Kai to a monolithic figure of sorrow rather than a fully dimensional human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circular structure (running → memory → resolution) works efficiently within constraints, but the pivot to decision feels abrupt. Coherence holds despite tight word limits, though the Syndicate's role remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually rich decay of the spaceport mirrors psychological disintegration. Sensory details (acrid air, splintered checkpoints) immerse readers, though Kepler's Edge remains a vague, idealized counterpoint without tangible texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (tea leaves as cartography of hope, chopstick as reliquary) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates with thematic inevitability, though over-reliance on "bitter" descriptors occasionally dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids cyberpunk clichés through lyrical grief rituals, but the Syndicate functions as a generic malevolent force rather than a unique antagonist. Tea leaf divination is inventive, though verges on mystical convenience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity between loss, memory, and escape creates cohesion. However, some assigned elements feel more like narrative scaffolding (waterfalls as MacGuffins) rather than organic story beats.</comment>
