<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak motivations are stated rather than demonstrated; "uniquely trustworthy" lacks organic integration. Shared trauma shapes their actions but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure mirrors the blueprints but sacrifices coherence. Flashbacks disrupt momentum, and the word limit leaves arcs incomplete. Plot relies on narrative gaps that feel unearned rather than suspenseful.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague descriptors ("hammered repose") rather than sensory specificity. The workshop and island settings exist as shallow metaphors without lived-in details to ground their significance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lack of interiority and overreliance on abstract phrases dilute emotional impact. Forced metaphors ("cacophony of discoveries") feel artificial. The ending's "harmony" lacks earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Stilted phrases ("lost innocence of that fateful summer") reek of clich√©. Character logic follows algorithmic patterns rather than human complexity. Tropes (haunted pasts, shadowy conspiracies) lack subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but lack cohesive force. The premise has potential but execution never transcends genre conventions. Lingering questions feel accidental rather than intentional.</comment>
