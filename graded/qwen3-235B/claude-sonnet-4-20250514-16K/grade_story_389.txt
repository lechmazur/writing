<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pale characterization beyond single-trait obsession; "formally casual" attire isn't meaningfully connected to behavior; motivation stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot advances logically toward artifact retrieval, but lacks meaningful stakes; rushed revelation feels abrupt within word constraints; established motivation pays off narratively but not emotionally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Moldy library aesthetics create strong foundation for atmosphere, but sensory details remain surface-level; cold/dust/timeframe elements evoke mood without achieving immersive environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sharp metaphoric language ("knowledge as sustenance") elevates base plot; ending introduces thematic tension between enlightenment and madness without fully exploring it; writing style maintains consistent voice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Predictable academic-obsession trope undermined by machine-generated flourishes; "thin lips curved" and "historical amnesia" feel like catalog copy; inconsistent psychological realism in character logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements minimally integrated rather than synergized; formal descriptions outweigh experiential storytelling; brevity sacrifices thematic payoff; atmospheric fragments don't coalesce into resonant whole.</comment>
