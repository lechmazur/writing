<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Characterization is conceptually rich but thinly developed; motivations align with assigned traits but lack depth in personal conflict, especially for the spirit whose emotional arc remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A tightly wound cause-effect chain sustains tension within constraints; the flinging action drives plot effectively, though the climactic resolution feels slightly rushed despite strong momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with evocative details (whale song, lighthouse, salt air) creating a mythic coastal world that deepens both literal and metaphorical stakes of cultural preservation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic layering (whale song as collective memory, dance as endangered tradition) produce profound emotional resonance; the ending achieves poetic closure through recurring visual/textural motifs.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining spectral guardianship with generational ritual, though some descriptions verge on florid. Emotional beats and character psychology avoid artificiality but occasionally prioritize poeticism over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Element integration is purposeful and cohesive, with each requirement shaping the story's architecture rather than feeling appended; the ritual drama never overwhelms the human/ghost interplay.</comment>
