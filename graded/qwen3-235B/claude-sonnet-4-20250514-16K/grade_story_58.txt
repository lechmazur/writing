<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paper-thin portrayal of Marcus's loyalty as a scout; motivation to spread meditation feels abruptly imposed rather than organically connected to his established traits; inconsistent use of first-person voice in conveying internal conflict; actions lack visceral conviction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coded jokes drive the plot unevenly—certain segments feel static; progression through blackout and jokes lacks escalation; beginning/end connection works, but emotional beats remain underdeveloped within the tight frame; cause/effect between his meditation goals and external events is murky.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moth imagery and flickering city lights create visual atmosphere, but sensory details about the tower's physicality (humidity? static electricity?) are absent; time frame’s urgency doesn't fully merge with Marcus's introspective struggles; setting becomes aesthetic backdrop rather than active force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphorical use of moths and breathing as transformation symbols; ending’s thematic resonance elevates the narrative; emotional subtext feels occasionally didactic; tension between Marcus's duty and inner chaos could be shown more concretely through specific physical mannerisms or flashbacks.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unique twist on resistance through comedy-as-coding avoids genre clichés, but execution shows AI fingerprints—repetitive “storm” imagery, overexplanation of symbols, and emotionally flat descriptions like “manufactured chaos”; the grandmother’s influence feels mythologized rather than humanized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Assigned elements (journal, blackout) create surface cohesion, but thematic integration falters; story leans on concept over execution; tone vacillates between sacred and sitcom; length constraints expose undercooked aspects of resistance infrastructure and character history.</comment>
