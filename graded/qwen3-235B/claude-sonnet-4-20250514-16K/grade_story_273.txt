<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and tied to the aristocratic rebellion, but Miraeth's internal conflict and unique voice lack sufficient depth beyond symbolic representation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from Miraeth's defiance to her archival method, but the word limit leaves structural development feeling compressed with underdeveloped turning points.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere created through sensory swamp details, pre-universe elements, and symbolic opposition between fortress and Council. Setting deeply reinforces theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative cosmic symbolism and thematic resonance elevate impact. While "showing" is strong (e.g., spinning yarn as creation), some metaphysical concepts lean toward abstraction over grounded emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original use of elements (yarn swift, pre-creation glass) and fresh subversion of rebellion tropes through archival activism. No formulaic phrasing; language stays purposeful despite poetic complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>Creative integration of all elements; each serves theme and worldbuilding. Concise form feels intentional, with the story's philosophical weight lingering beyond its brevity.</grade>
