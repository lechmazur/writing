<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character defined through actions but lacks internal conflict; connection between "serene fisher" and behavior is abstract; motivation via ancient texts is clear but not deeply nuanced; emotional reactions told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot lacks progression; no clear arc or resolution within confines; action of unraveling quilt drives minimal development but is static; cause/effect between threads and plant growth is accepted but not interrogated; pacing meanders rather than builds tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery of absurd greenhouse is vivid; humid air, spores, and threadwork create immersive atmosphere; tension between scientific rationality and mystical revival enhances theme; lullaby's silence as timeframe is evocative but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., resurrection as revelation) are impactful but unevenly developed; subtext about death/illusion lingers; relies on poetic abstraction over concrete emotional resonance; writing style is evocative but occasionally florid; conflict (skepticism vs. reverence) remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quilt method is imaginative but execution risks novelty over substance; avoids clich√© in botanical resurrection but relies on vague "ancient wisdom"; sensory details are specific but occasionally overdetermined; tone remains consistent but occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack narrative urgency; synthesis of absurdity, resurrection, and heritage is clever; brevity serves as thematic compression but feels limiting; final impression leans more on poetic gesture than emotional or philosophical depth.</comment>
