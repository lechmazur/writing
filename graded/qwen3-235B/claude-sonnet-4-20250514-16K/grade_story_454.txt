<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's reckless determination is clear but underdeveloped; her rational-emotional conflict is suggested but lacks depth. Motivation for acceptance is overt yet feels surface-level compared to the weight of her choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Time-stamped tension drives the plot, but the synchronized alarms as a method feel underexplored. The arc from token to transformation works, though the map-tearing motif is abstract rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Decaying funhouse as setting is immersive and thematically rich—sensory decay mirrors character transformation. Timeframe's "map tear" concept works metaphorically but lacks literal connection to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional contrast in "jubilant despair" resonates. Symbolism of freezing luck in resin and shattering it carries weight. Subtext about freedom vs. belonging is present but not fully dissected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("laughter echoes bitter joy") elevate it beyond clichés, but some phrases border on ornate. Kai's absence feels emotionally stated rather than felt; the "unknown" theme lacks philosophical complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive within strict constraints, though the synchronized alarms and map motif feel imposed rather than organic. Atmospheric details succeed where thematic integration falters; momentum drives it despite rough edges.</comment>
