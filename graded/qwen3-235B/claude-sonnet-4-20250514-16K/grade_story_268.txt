<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Growing trauma and pursuit of truth are clear, but interiority remains somewhat distant. Subtle physical cues (bead squeezing, mirror reactions) show engagement, though emotional arc lacks full development within constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Meets word count parameters with beginning (setup), middle (extraction), and end (documentation). Clear causality in using flattery to expose deception, but payoff feels slightly abbreviated - no concrete consequence for Eleanor or future ramifications.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned terminal matches Marcus's status as discarded soldier. The mirror's contortions effectively mirror moral corruption. Virtual calls contrast sterile professionalism with wartime chaos. Sensory details (glow reflection, tactile bead) amplify atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mirror as metaphor for distorted truth is elegant. "Ancient art meets modern tech" premise shows ingenuity. Ending provides thematic symmetry without neat resolution. Some emotional beats (screaming silence) lean slightly on stated rather than shown nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overwriting, yet certain phrases ("price of war," "profit margins") verge on expected war narrative language. Flattery reveals lie method shows creativity, but trauma manifestations feel more catalogued than deeply explored. No sudden tonal swerves, but style rarely transcends competence to become exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements serve theme rather than vice versa. The tight focus never feels constrained. Ending closes with quiet triumph rather than catharsis, leaving room for thought without forcing meaning. Would benefit from more emotional dimensionality or philosophical complexity.</comment>
