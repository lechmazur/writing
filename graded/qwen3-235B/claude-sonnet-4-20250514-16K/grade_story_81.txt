<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Flat, exposition-driven character motivations with insufficient exploration of inner conflict or nuance; emotional arc feels artificially imposed rather than organically developed through specific, meaningful actions or reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Loose structure with minimal conflict, relying on philosophical reflection rather than narrative progression; beginning-to-end transition is conceptually clear but dramatically inert within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid but superficial sensory details; atmospheric elements (time-dilated zone, rusting fence) provide strong mood but underdeveloped connections to thematic or emotional substance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and symbolic resonance in moments (coin as emotional conduit, rust as metaphor), but reliance on abstract statements weakens narrative authority and emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Permeated by familiar phrases ("weight of centuries," "river of shared experience") and uneven tone; metaphors feel derivative despite occasional flashes of specificity in temporal descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ideationally cohesive but narratively thin, leaning on lyrical abstraction rather than structural ingenuity; leaves intellectual impression rather than visceral or emotional resonance.</comment>
