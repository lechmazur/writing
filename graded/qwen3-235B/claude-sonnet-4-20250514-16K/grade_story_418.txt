<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's headstrong nature is demonstrated through resolve but lacks depth in showing internal conflict; motivation is clear but could explore more nuanced reasons for secrecy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pacing is tight, but the transformation resolution feels abrupt; the core action aligns with the plot, but the arc benefits from the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, eerie imagery (phosphorescent fruit, gray sky) immerses readers; atmosphere perfectly complements post-apocalyptic desolation and thematic rebirth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., glitter as authenticity) and the theme of self-acceptance as salvation are emotionally resonant; ending balances hope with irony.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but relies on predictable "post-apocalyptic savior" setup; prose is ornate but purposeful, with emotionally nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (glitter, transformation) are integral and cohesively woven; the narrative density feels intentional, though the brevity limits deeper exploration.</comment>
