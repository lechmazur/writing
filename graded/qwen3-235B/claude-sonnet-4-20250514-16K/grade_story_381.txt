<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak character differentiation; motivations are underdeveloped. Kara’s necromantic abilities feel like a tool rather than an integral part of her identity, and Devon exists primarily as a voice in a headset with minimal personality beyond shared movie references. Emotional depth is superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks structural urgency despite the high-stakes terraforming crisis. The conflict is introduced but underserved; the story leans on implied stakes without demonstrating them. Pacing is meandering, with cause-and-effect connections feeling perfunctory in the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is atmospheric but thin. While crystalline descriptions and tactile details (humid breath, vibrating walls) work, the setting never fully transcends generic "alien cave" vibes. Nostalgic elements feel tacked on rather than woven into the environment’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Decent integration of metaphor (nostalgia as lifeline) and irony in necromancy aiding survival. The theme of human connection in isolation is present but shallow. Ending attempts to evoke triumph but lacks earned emotional payoff due to the story’s brevity and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mixes fresh ideas (necromancers mapping minerals) with clichéd elements (bonding over classic films). Some originality in blending sci-fi with necromantic lore, but predictable emotional cues (“rare smile,” “whispered conversations”) and underutilized concepts (geological memory) undermine uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not transformative. The setting’s scientific and emotional dimensions clash unevenly, and the ending feels arbitrary rather than resonant. While coherent, the story fails to transcend its construction-by-assignment origins.</comment>
