<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lack of emotional or psychological depth undermines the botanist’s motivation; eccentricity substitutes for developed characterization. The comically serious tone flattens interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but feel contrived—film revelation and dimension-shifting occur without logical buildup; abrupt shifts in scale (plants to interdimensional travel) dilute coherence. Premise outpaces execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>High-altitude setting provides atmospheric mist but contributes little beyond visual texture; sensory details are sparse and inconsistently applied (e.g., mist emphasized, but no tactile or olfactory cues). Tea house as location feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bleak humor and precise, archaic diction ("tax audit solemnity") create memorable tonal contrast; theme of scientific hubris is clear but simplistic. Resists easy interpretation through uncanny imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original framing of botanical anomaly as portal to cosmic truth offers freshness but generic metaphors ("funeral director gravity") and exposition-heavy delivery undercut uniqueness. Sensory details lean on clichés rather than specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story cohesively marries elements like belt and film but struggles to integrate setting/timeframe meaningfully. Conceptual ambition exceeds technical polish; ending feels cut off rather than resolved.</comment>
