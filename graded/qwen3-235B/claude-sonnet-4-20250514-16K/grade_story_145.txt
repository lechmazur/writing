<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to use emotional resonance over math is consistent, but his "uncertainly certain" trait remains superficial. The rosebud's connection to his grandmother adds depth, but reactions to objects lack nuance. Dialogue-free narration struggles to establish a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Central action of reconquering Empathy Wells drives the plot, but the tight timeframe creates fragmentation between key moments. Echo test as pivotal method lacks logical connection to water pipes. Pacing feels rushed, particularly in resolving emotional stakes. Clear arc attempted but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Abandoned mansion and castle ruins offer atmospheric potential but remain under-imagined. Sensory details about sound are strong, but visual/tactile elements feel generic. The Empathy Wells' withered state insufficiently connected to setting decay. Timeframe description remains abstract rather than shaping atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of sound as emotional conduit works effectively. Theme of empathy vs. sterile systems emerges clearly. Ending's emotional payoff relies on stated rather than demonstrated transformation. Story shows potential for subtext but doesn't fully commit to layered meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Colliding destinies" framing feels overly portentous without earned meaning. Emotional resonance concept subverts fantasy tropes but execution leans on familiar redemption arcs. Descriptions border on purple prose ("metallic veins"). Character psychology remains more logical than humanly nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but unevenly integrated. Secret society and hidden worlds feel perfunctory rather than essential. The echo test method lacks narrative weight. Tone struggles between mythic and grounded. Strong thematic core undermined by structural thinness and underdeveloped implications.</comment>
