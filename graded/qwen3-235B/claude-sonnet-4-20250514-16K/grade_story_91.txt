<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Balances Marcus's artificial origins with subtle empathy, but underdevelops his internal conflict; actions align with motivation but lack psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Escalation from ghost stories to atmospheric manipulation is logical but feels compressed; the resolution hinges on poetic imagery rather than narrative payoff within tight space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid juxtaposition of sterile technology and organic phenomena through tactile details (bullet-riddled hat, humming machinery), though weather station's function remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegantly subverts "enhancement" sci-fi tropes; avoids cliché through precise sensory details but occasionally falters with ornate sentence structure ("the patient work of someone").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't inseparable; conceit drives narrative yet feels slightly external—readers notice construction behind the "quiet revolution" aesthetic.</comment>
