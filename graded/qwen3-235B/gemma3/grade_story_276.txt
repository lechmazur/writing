<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Characters show moderate depth through subtle actions and internal shifts, but motivations (Tiber's assessment mission, Thorne's emotional fragmentation) could be more explicitly tied to the plot's pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of realization within tight constraints, though the transition from assessment to empathy could use smoother cause-and-effect beats to avoid feeling somewhat abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orbital setting establishes a unique atmosphere, but sensory details (station scaffolding, thermos spill) are underutilized to fully contrast Thorne's earthbound nostalgia against sterile space environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poignant emotional undercurrents emerge through symbolic objects (coathanger, postcards) and restrained dialogue, culminating in a resonant thematic payoff about fractured redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging hard sci-fi elements with intimate character study. Avoids purple prose but occasionally uses slightly generic descriptors ("quiet moments") that could be more vivid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively to explore theme of reassembly, though brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of Tiber's transformation. Lingering question about cosmic vs. personal patterns remains potent.</comment>
