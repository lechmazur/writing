<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tiber’s motivation to decode letters aligns with his character but lacks depth in emotional nuance. His reactions to objects hint at growth but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is logical but slightly rushed; the transition to the epiphany feels abrupt despite a clear beginning-to-end arc. Pacing within the constraint is competent but lacks layered development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (bioluminescent script, coral shelves) enhance atmosphere, but the "earthbound flight" tone could be more consistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext (umbrella spoke, teacup) and emotional resonance. The ending is poignant but slightly undercuts the depth of Tiber’s realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evasive of clichés (e.g., underwater library’s uniqueness) but some elements (dog-park meeting) border on contrivance. Prose is evocative but occasionally veers into mild ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements cohesively serve the theme of ordinary legacy. The brief length enhances focus but leaves some character/setting textures underexplored. Memorable emotional payoff.</comment>
