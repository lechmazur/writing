<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation alignment; Tiber's "loyalty" lacks concrete behavioral manifestation. Elara's rapid narrative integration feels contrived. Dialogue minimal prevents distinct voice establishment. Assigned traits partially realized but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rapid escalation from dance class meet-cute to psychic disturbance lacks connective tissue. Scrimshaw-driven climax coherent but compressed. Pacing alternates between descriptive stagnation and rushed conceptual revelations. Timeframe constraints highlight structural fragility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and lake create vivid, tactile otherworldliness. "Ghostly images" on cavern walls visually striking but unconnected to timeframe element. Sensory details abundant but unevenly applied across assigned concepts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Conceptual depth about art's existential role emerges through action rather than exposition. Some "telling" regarding theme ("fundamental to the fabric of existence"). Resonant ending lacks visceral character reaction to balance abstract ideas.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cavern atmosphere avoids clich√© but dance class introduction relies on predictable awkward-meet trope. Overadjective descriptions ("gentle glow") dilute tension. Trauma-perception link feels algorithmically thematic rather than organically explored. Motive logic lacks human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic unification efforts evident but execution uneven. Assigned elements function narratively yet struggle to coalesce into transcendent whole. Intellectual provocations dominate over emotional engagement. Brief length feels restrictive, not intentional.</comment>
