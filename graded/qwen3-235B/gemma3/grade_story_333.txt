<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations but lack depth. Dialogue doesn't establish distinct voices. Actions align with motivations but characters aren't fully developed within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Predictable structure with rushed feeling. Clear beginning and end connection on surface, but plot progression feels slightly contrived. Cause and effect relationships are basic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Effective sensory details establish mood, but tone consistency wavers. Some elements enhance atmosphere better than others. Atmospheric connections to themes could be stronger.</comment>
