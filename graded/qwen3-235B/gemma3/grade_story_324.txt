<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's insecurity drives the plot but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but insufficiently nuanced, with underdeveloped psychological complexity beyond base ambition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing unevenly compresses cause and effect; the climax feels abrupt, but thematic coherence between Tiber's actions and unresolved ending provides structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reinforced glass, green-lit jars, and echoing footsteps create visceral atmosphere; elements like "simmering future" enhance mood but unevenly integrate with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., duplicate brain as fractured self) and ambiguous ending provoke reflection; occasionally over-reliant on conceptual abstraction at the expense of emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through psychological focus; fresh in its fusion of espionage and speculative neuro-tech, but occasional purple prose ("simmering future") dilutes precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements service theme but strain plausibility; some forced applications (e.g., "discarded iteration") outweighed by cohesion in exploring obsession-as-redemption.</comment>
