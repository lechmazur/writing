<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack complexity; internal conflict is hinted at but underdeveloped. Actions align with stated goals but never transcend archetype to feel uniquely human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves basic completeness in tight word count but suffers from rushed pacing and abrupt resolution. Causal connections exist but feel mechanical rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere exists as surface-level mood with sparse sensory details. Setting elements (variable star, capsules) lack meaningful integration with emotional or thematic layers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story contains poetic imagery and conceptual resonance but often tells rather than shows. Symbolism (singing bird, dissolving nail) works on surface level without deeper emotional excavation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls but suffers from periodic "concept overload" - too many abstract ideas (silence, revolution, spiritual decay) overwhelm human elements. Figurative language occasionally feels forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story demonstrates coherent execution of assigned elements but struggles with balancing density of concepts against emotional impact. Lingering questions about societal transformation feel more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
