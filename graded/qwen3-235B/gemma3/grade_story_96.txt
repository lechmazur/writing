<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but under-explored; internal motivation drives action but lacks emotional depth or transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc is complete but minimalist; the map’s discovery and decision to pursue it form a coherent structure, though tension is subdued.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, quirky setting with sensory details (lavender, map’s hum), but atmospheric elements occasionally verge on whimsy rather than deep thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing; metaphors are inventive yet occasionally abstracted from character/subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel like fragments of a larger narrative; thematic ambition is strong, though emotional payoff is subdued in brevity.</comment>
