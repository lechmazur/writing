<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack deeper psychological complexity; the brazen raider's internal conflict between sentiment and pragmatism is hinted at but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is tightly controlled despite word constraints, with sigil-drawing as a coherent, symbolically-driven action sustaining tension despite compressed pacing in the final act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric integration of the underwater decay and tremors; charcoal's tactile presence and lab's oppressive environment create immersive, thematically resonant physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of fractured grace through impermanent sigils achieves poignant subtext; the ending's restrained hope balances against explicit exposition about character motivations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original use of bio-acoustic themes within sci-fi framework; occasional over-polished prose ("echoes of betrayal") distracts but doesn't overwhelm nuanced emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Elements harmonize effectively within constraints; the charcoal-as-mnemonic-device conceit and collapsing underwater setting create lingering questions about preservation vs. dissolution.</comment>
