<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Potential for depth is undercut by underrealized traits; the twist ties lineage to legacy but lacks emotional gravitas despite strong concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Compelling elements suggest a story of ambition and legacy, undercut by undercooked themes and compressed pacing that muddies emotional weight.</comment>
