<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slight underdevelopment in transformation arc; emotional progression feels rushed yet earns emotional payoff through final moment of vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight coherence within constraints; cause-effect of analysis leading to revelation is logical, though the timeframe compression feels slightly abrupt in closing emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie gravestone-adorned greenhouse creates potent atmosphere; sensory details (ozone, trembling light) and setting-object integration (Tesla bulb’s historical weight) amplify thematic tension between science and emotion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elicits subtle emotional resonance through metaphor (bulb as hope/grief) and layered themes; subtle showing of character change through tear, though ending risks sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on Gothic elements; some overwrought phrases ("arms of steel") undercut subtlety, though the Tesla-buried grief twist demonstrates ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements coexist effectively but not seamlessly; the compressed narrative leaves minor questions about character logic, though the thematic interplay of science and mourning lingers impressively.</comment>
