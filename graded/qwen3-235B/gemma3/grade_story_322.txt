<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks dimensional depth behind conceptual function; motivation drives plot but remains intellectualized rather than emotionally grounded. Voice occasionally distinctive ("mocking sincerity") but inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot contains clear arc but pacing feels stretched in middle sections; pendulum method symbolically resonant yet structurally underdeveloped. Cause/effect between Tiber's actions and realization needs stronger narrative linkage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies heavily on vague descriptors ("echoing," "silent") rather than specific sensory details; timelessness creates intriguing tension but underutilizes workshop setting's mechanical specifics to deepen mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Successfully employs metaphor (pendulum, pitcher as artifact) and thematic coherence around memory; philosophical revelations feel earned rather than stated, though some sections veer toward abstract generalization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic plotting through meditative focus on measurement as metaphor; occasionally falters with overqualified phrases ("rational whimsy") and conceptual generalizations rather than concrete imagery. Maintains consistent tonal paradox.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively as thematic constellation yet lack individual distinctness; length constraints expose underdeveloped secondary layers (Elmsworth's role, mechanics of "interconnectedness"). Leaves resonant implication.</comment>
