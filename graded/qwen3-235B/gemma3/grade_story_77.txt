<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s empathy is subtly demonstrated through resonance-based actions but remains under-expressed in visceral emotional stakes. Tiber’s motivation as a marshal-turned-champion lacks psychological depth; his transformation feels implied rather than earned. Dialogue and internal logic hint at themes but don’t fully humanize either character beyond archetypes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The plot hinges on assembling the marionette, yet the connection between fragments and “mountain wisdom” remains abstract, weakening cause-effect clarity. The journal’s final line serves as a thematic anchor but feels contrived. Ending ties together emotionally but rushes the resolution of the central tension, sacrificing narrative gravity for poetic brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The asteroid hideout’s chaotic pirate backdrop contrasts faintly with the workshop’s drowsy atmosphere, but the setting lacks tactile specificity (e.g., sounds of raucous laughter fade in/out). Sensory details like the brittle starfish are potent but sparse; the setting functions more as a scaffold for themes than an immersive, textured world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like the marionette-as-emotional-map and starfish-as-emotions are inventive and thematically resonant. The story gently evokes introspection about wholeness and resilience, though some “telling” (e.g., “quiet knowing”) undercuts subtlety. The ending’s quiet epiphany is poignant but risks oversimplifying the complexity it claims to celebrate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but skirts “purple prose” in descriptions like “gentle hum against the backdrop” (overly curated phrasing). Metaphors are fresh yet occasionally strain credibility (marionette as a cosmic map). Emotions lean on symbolic gestures more than organic character reactions, hinting at algorithmic tidiness rather than raw human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story’s integration of elements is resourceful, but the pirate hideout and “mountain wisdom” feel secondary to the character-driven core. The tight word limit sharpens focus on thematic coherence but sacrifices full exploration of the setting’s potential. Leaves a lingering contemplation of emotional fragmentation but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
