<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character defined obliquely through actions and assigned traits, but motivation lacks psychological depth despite clear thematic alignment with "daring compassion." Teddy bear's role as tether is conceptually meaningful but underfleshes Tiber's persona beyond metaphorical weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure exists within constraints but resolution feels rushed, relying on vague "redirection" logic. Cosmic disclaimers and ricochet method lack technical specificity, yet the aurora battle provides visual coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Digital-ether blend has conceptual promise but sensory details are sporadic and uneven—auroras visualized strongly while "elegant chaos" remains abstract. Setting's load cycle timeframe creates urgency but isn't meaningfully integrated beyond plot device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story successfully merges poetic metaphor (teddy bear as grounding force) with cyber-fantasy, creating resonant imagery. Subtext about compassionate preservation of systems vs. destructive heroism is subtly layered. Emotional restraint enhances impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through unusual combinations (wizard/VR archive) and non-anthropomorphic conflict (wraith as fragmented code). Some phrases ("breathtaking cascade") risk conventionality, but the persistent tension between ethereal/spiritual and digital/material feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative but uneven execution weakens overall impression. Conceptual boldness (cosmic disclaimers) and emotional gravity compete with occasionally hollow worldbuilding, creating a story that's intriguing but not fully realized.</comment>
