<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are consistently tied to "fractured illusions" but lack emotional depth beneath surface traits; the "distracted inventor" archetype is present but thinly rendered beyond functional plot roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect chain exists for infiltration, but pacing stumbles during tool acquisition and amplified climax; plot completeness achieved through thematic resolution rather than structural payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive cyberpunk atmosphere through precise sensory details (synth-ramen, frozen escalator), though deeper integration of "digitally dark" despair with character psychology remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant in final memory-override sequence, with strong symbolic contrast between industrial tools and ethereal restoration; metaphor density occasionally strains reader focus on core human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through specific details (bird-call emitter, scent-of-rain project), though "weird old man" characterization borders on formulaic; maintains stylistic clarity amid speculative flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified whole with thematic purposefulness; brevity enhances urgency but limits full exploration of "fractured illusions" as both technical and existential concept.</comment>
