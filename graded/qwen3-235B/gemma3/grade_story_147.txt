<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains static; motivation is stated but not deeply explored through internal conflict or nuanced decisions. Lack of distinct voice weakens emotional connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but feels rushed; transitions between Tiber's actions and realizations lack depth. Pacing within word limit is uneven but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through vivid sensory details (metallic scent, melancholic swing) but occasionally veers into ornate descriptors that distract from immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("balance between rust and gold") and symbolism are effective, but emotional resonance is limited by minimal character growth and subdued tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some phrases lean toward poetic excess ("forgotten dreams") and familiar tropes. The concept of decoding wind chimes is original but executed with predictable reverence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively but superficially; brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of themes. Leaves lingering questions but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
