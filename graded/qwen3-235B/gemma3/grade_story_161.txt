<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (grief, suspicion) are clear and drive the plot, though the orchardist vocation remains mostly decorative rather than informing his methods or worldview. The sardonic voice is consistent but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Conspiracy reveal has coherent progression from seal discovery to pattern analysis, but the limited word count rushes the denouement. The circular connection between past/future failures feels forced, though the central action is logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends sterile tech with personal obsession effectively, but sensory details (e.g., textures of paper, smell of facility) remain underused. The setting’s juxtaposition with orchardist identity could deepen.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in peacock feathers as “hidden eyes” elevates the subtext. The marriage of pattern analysis and grief as a driving force is compelling, though some emotional beats rely on summary rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with orchardist-scholar hybrid identity and biological encryption. Some phrases (“senseless loss”) verge on cliché, but the fusion of natural patterns with conspiracy feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>ELEMENTS are tightly woven but unevenly weighted – the peacock method feels contrived compared to organic connections like seal/wife’s family. The ending suggests potential rather than closure, fitting the brief length.</comment>
