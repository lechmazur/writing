<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation aligns with actions but lacks depth in showing transformation; "town-weary traveler" trope remains shallowly explored beyond surface melancholy</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("cradle of sparks"); emotional resonance relies too heavily on imagery at expense of concrete character beats</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic pulse and evocative prose elevate otherwise formulaic redemption arc; brevity serves mood but constrains character depth</comment>
