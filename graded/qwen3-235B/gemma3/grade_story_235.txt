<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbols than fully realized individuals; Takeda's motivation is intellectually clear but lacks emotional grounding, while Hana/Kenji's shifts feel schematic rather than organic. Their artistic growth lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a predictable symbolic arc with mechanical progression; the meteor patterns driving the interaction feel contrived within the word limit, leaving insufficient time to earn the eventual connection's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ambient atmosphere is evocative (ancient stones, herbal scents), but the reimagined castle setting remains superficially sketched; meteoric imagery contributes more to theme than tangible spatial immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (pressed flowers = fate, meteors = connection) are elegantly executed with layered meaning, though the ending feels conceptually resolved rather than emotionally transformative; the central conflict of personal expression vs. cosmic design is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "whispers of the cosmos" phrasing borders on clich√©; character reactions often feel logically deduced rather than psychologically authentic; atmospheric descriptions occasionally lapse into decorative abstraction rather than sensory immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High-concept elements work in unison but create a preciousness that undermines deeper engagement; the structure successfully marries form to theme (subtle nudges = storytelling method), yet leaves the emotional core undernourished.</comment>
