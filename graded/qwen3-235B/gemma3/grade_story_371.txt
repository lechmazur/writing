<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and integration of assigned traits, but lacks deeper exploration of internal conflict and nuanced emotional responses to adversity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Logical progression from marbles to vault, but feels rushed; beginning and end connect but lack a fully developed middle. Pacing strains coherence under word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vibrant, specific sensory details ground the cyberpunk setting; atmosphere effectively contrasts character's hope, though some descriptions verge on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</comment>Emotional impact undercut by overt thematic statements; symbolism (glowing hatpin, "ember" kindness) works but lacks subtlety. Ending feels abrupt, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some generic descriptors ("neon-slicked," "bioluminescence") but overall avoids predictable tropes through juxtaposition of lowlife protagonist and mystical elements. Nuanced voice strained by occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion through tight object-driven plot; brevity serves urgency but sacrifices thematic payoff. Leaves lingering questions about the vault's consequences rather than emotional resonance.</comment>
