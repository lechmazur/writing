<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's grit and grief are well-conveyed, but the "irate smuggler" trait feels superficially integrated; motivation through loss resonates, yet the professional ruthlessness implied by "smuggler" lacks sufficient narrative manifestation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through the tea-leaf catalyst and waterfall journey, but the tight arc relies heavily on convenient revelations; pacing balances introspection with action but occasionally feels compressed in emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid, tactile details (corroded metal, bioluminescent fungi) and contrast between desolate exterior and hidden sanctuary; timeframe during jogging serves as functional but underutilized narrative device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling shines via metaphoric chopstick/tea-leaf symbolism and thematic revelation about present-moment truth; ending achieves emotional resonance through understated epiphany rather than overt sentiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic sci-fi tropes with nuanced grief portrayal and tea-leaf metaphysics, but smuggler's profession feels like generic backdrop; lyrical prose occasionally edges toward ornate abstraction rather than visceral precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere through emotional throughline despite occasional contrivance; brevity enhances thematic focus on memory's persistence; the chopstick and tea ritual uniquely anchor cosmic themes in tangible human behavior.</comment>
