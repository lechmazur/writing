<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (desertion as escapism) is clear but thinly developed; Elias' internal conflict lacks nuanced psychological depth, leaving his actions feeling more symbolic than authentically human.></comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure contains striking surreal imagery but lacks narrative tension; the transition from repair to destruction feels undermotivated, and the 400-word arc prioritizes thematic beats over coherent emotional progression.></comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through synesthetic details (chlorophyll/ash scents, glowing porcelain), with the plant communication study's bioluminescent eeriness contrasting effectively against thematic emptiness.></comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (ash as liberation through erasure) and lyrical prose elevate it, but emotional impact feels conceptual rather than viscerally earned through character embodiment.></comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of botanical science and trauma metaphysics, but occasional ornate phrasing ("whispering plants") and the overly pat "ash = release" resolution verge on clichÃ©.></comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesive aesthetic unity exists, but psychological complexity and narrative momentum suffer under the weight of heavy thematic scaffolding. The ending satisfies intellectually but not emotionally.></comment>
