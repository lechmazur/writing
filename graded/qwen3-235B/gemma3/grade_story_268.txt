<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Subdued vigilante lacks typical vigilante traits; motivation is vague and abstract rather than driven by tangible stakes. Assigned attribute doesn't distinctly shape actions or personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptual plot with thematic cohesion but lacks narrative urgency. The emotional cartography method drives some progression but feels overly abstract to sustain plot momentum in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ashen atmosphere of decay and silence effectively rendered through sparse but vivid details (bombed-out theater, chipped Formica). Setting amplifies thematic tension but lacks deeper spatial or temporal immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphor of trauma as distortable reflection. Ending crystallizes theme but feels telegraphed. Effective use of symbolism elevates impact beyond surface narrative, though some emotional beats are told rather than shown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through imaginative connections (funhouse mirror as trauma archive). Some overly poetic phrases ("screaming silence") border on cliché. Unique voice emerges through lyrically fractured descriptions rather than mechanical repetition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Cohesive around unifying theme but struggles with element integration. Brief length works for lyrical abstraction but restricts deeper exploration of vigilante identity or emotional cartography mechanics.</comment>
