<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters show clear motivations and alignment with traits (Tiber’s secretive protectiveness, politeness), but Elara lacks dimension and motivations feel underserved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pacing is taut but coherent; the beginning (coin toss) and end (Tiber’s vigil) connect logically through the intervention, though some plot mechanics feel condensed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like violets and chamomile establish tone, but the workshop’s potential as a symbolic or atmospheric space remains partially unrealized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (e.g., compass as subversion of greed) and theme of subtle defiance resonate, but dialogue and emotional nuance lack depth to elevate impact further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (e.g., “whispers of the sea”), though occasional poetic abstraction borders on predictability without deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively (e.g., mariner’s wheel as both token and tool), suggesting intent over constraint, but underdeveloped threads limit transcendent depth.</comment>
