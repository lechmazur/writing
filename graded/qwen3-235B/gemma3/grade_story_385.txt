<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters lean into archetypes without sufficient interiority or evolution; motivations (Tiber's cryptic purpose, Thorne's fractured state) feel abstract rather than psychologically rooted. Thorne's reaction to the skates hints at backstory but lacks visceral emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves through implication rather than dramatic progression; atmospheric setup dominates over narrative momentum. The focus on symbolic gestures over clear stakes muddies coherence, though the shrinking footprints as a conceit tie the elements together cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting achieves eerie specificity: the obsidian skyscraper's presence looms metaphorically, and the pre-dawn hospital/hospital-beach juxtaposition creates tension between sterile institutionalism and primal natural forces. Sensory details (rust, salt air) are purposefully sparse but effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Echoes of Jungian archetypes and existential dread emerge through layered metaphors (ice skates as fragility, absorbed footprints as cognition under siege). Ending lacks catharsis but leaves lingering unease, aligning with its cerebral intent. Over-relies on exposition to convey meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; the "fractured genius" trope is subverted through Thorne's wordless dissolution. Some phrases ("pleasant meddler") edge toward preciousness, and the manipulation mechanism feels slightly procedural. Maintains unique voice through poetic abstraction rather than conventional plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically but remain conceptually dense rather than organically integrated. The tight word count suits its enigmatic tone, though deeper exploration of Thorne's psyche would elevate it from intriguing sketch to resonant work.</comment>
