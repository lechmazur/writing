<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development is present but surface-level; Tiber's "scars" and role as gatekeeper hint at depth but remain abstract. Motivations (scars, old ghosts) are inconsistently tied to actions, leaning on vague backstory rather than concrete behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed; the agent subplot provides momentum, but the 500-word limit strains emotional payoff. Connection between beginning/end feels abrupt, relying on atmospheric beats rather than narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; descriptions like "echoes of lives" create mood, but underdeveloped sensory details (e.g., well's dampness, coin textures) leave the world feeling half-realized. Tone leans on "mysterious" clichés.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy and scars resonate through symbols (coins, shadows), but emotional engagement is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending repeats motifs without deepening meaning. Conflicts are implied, not dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but retains formulaic traces (e.g., "shadow patterns" as detective trope). Language is mostly crisp but occasionally falters with vague descriptors ("grim understanding"). Subtext is implied but not rigorously explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack interplay; the secret agent angle enriches setting but feels detached from Tiber's personal arc. Conciseness works for mood but limits thematic resonance. Lingering atmosphere overrides narrative clarity.</comment>
