<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Limited character depth despite vivid traits; motivations are clear but lack nuanced psychological complexity. The shift from cynic to empathetic vessel feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually sound but pacing feels compressed; the ritual's buildup lacks measured tension, and the resolution occurs too quickly for full emotional impact within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through precise sensory details (light, crystals, scent of salt), but the lighthouse library’s physical logistics remain ambiguously sketched beneath its poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Uses recurring metaphors of celestial/spiritual resonance effectively; the ending’s subtext about becoming a vessel for collective memory resonates, but emotional beats occasionally lean on atmospheric vagueness over visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (globe as resonator, "borrowed century"), but risks overwrought description in phrases like "echoes of lives lived and lost to the sea." Avoids most clichés but occasionally lapses into poetic repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion with lingering thematic weight, but the brevity strains the character arc’s plausibility and the methodological details of the ritual feel underexplored for full narrative satisfaction.</comment>
