<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character remains static and internalization is minimal, but portrayal of passive observation through actions like oil changes and use of the twist tie offer subtle insights into his contemplative motivation and detachment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively from routine to surreal moment, with clear cause-effect through sensory triggers (bees, light). Ending resolution is understated yet thematically complete, though pacing lags slightly in midsection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Orchard/cathedral setting vividly realized through precise sensory details (stained glass, metallic sounds, bees) that create a mystical, immersive atmosphere directly supporting the story’s thematic focus on beauty in the present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (peach as offering) and symbolism (stained glass light) effectively; quiet subtext about perception of grace elevates the narrative, with a thematic arc that rewards reflection and shows emotional restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh imagery (bees’ “mournful” tone, golden peach) and restrained prose. No formulaic cadences; emotional subtext arises from juxtaposition of mechanical actions with mystical occurrences rather than explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are seamlessly woven into a concise, purposeful narrative that lingers thematically. The brevity enhances the mystical tone and thematic focus on transient beauty rather than constraining it.</comment>
