<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (avenging grandfather's disappearance) is clear but lacks psychological complexity; actions align with motivation but lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is linear and functional but feels truncated; coffee-ground revelation drives action efficiently though teleological progression leaves structural gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is inconsistently rendered - desert heat and temple's menace contrast unevenly; sensory details too sparse to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Somber tone and intergenerational mystery evoke moderate emotional resonance; symbolism (cutlass as legacy) works but lacks layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (cursed artifacts, lost civilizations) without subversion; coffee ground divination feels clich√©d; language occasionally veers into melodramatic purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements function cooperatively but predictably; brevity undermines thematic depth; ending achieves setup without sufficient payoff for high-stakes themes.</comment>
