<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters show surface motivation but lack depth; Tiber's swindler past influences his testing of Elara, but his sudden shift to altruism feels underdeveloped. Dialogue reveals some personality but lacks distinct voice. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through key actions but feels rushed; beginning-mid-end connection exists though underdeveloped. Assigned elements (computer, book) drive plot but pacing unevenness within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes decay and mystery through skeletal tower and dancing dust motes, but setting's symbolic potential (orchard vs. skyscraper collapse) is underexplored. Sensory details effective but sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story builds emotional tension around reality's fragility, uses resonance as metaphor. Subtext about truth and deception works, but climax feels slightly rushed. Literary devices effective but unevenly applied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally uses overfamiliar sci-fi tropes (haunted AIs, reality-warp macguffins). Some phrases (e.g., "echoes of architects") verge on poetic vagueness; character reasoning occasionally too simplistic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements integrated unevenly; orchard-in-skyscraper is fresh, but "invisible allies" execution feels strained. Writing style sometimes prioritizes atmospheric abstraction over clarity; tension between story structure and assigned elements persists.</comment>
