<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation tied to inherited agoraphobia, but inner conflict lacks nuanced development. "Eager resignation" voice is underexplored, though transformation feels credible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-driven structure works well within word limits; rhythm method ties tightly to plot. Pacing slightly uneven during lens revelation, but cause-effect logic remains intact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Whispering dunes and opalescent particles create vivid atmosphere, but connections between desert setting and snuffbox mechanics remain underdeveloped despite strong sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (lens as perception shift), satisfying emotional arc. Theme of inherited burdens resonates, though ending leans slightly on sentimental phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s; "realistically fanciful" details refreshing. Some ornate descriptions border on purple prose ("melody of hope"), but character reasoning maintains human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively under tight word constraints. Story feels intentionally concise but occasionally sacrifices deeper exploration of secondary motifs like the city's automated chimes.</comment>
