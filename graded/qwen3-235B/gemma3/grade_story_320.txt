<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (cosmic balance) is clear but underexplored; shy diviner's passive actions lack psychological depth. Assigned traits (shyness, disinterest) inconsistently applied during social media intervention.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot propulsion via social media lacks tension; abrupt resolution feels convenient. Connection between beginning/middle/end exists but sacrifices emotional weight for conceptual brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Submerged city's melancholy atmosphere enhanced by photographs' "clear sorrow." Sensory details sparse but strategically deployed (e.g., "silt-choked stalls") to reinforce thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (regret as sediment, timelines as unstable architecture) elevate thematic resonance. Ending balances closure with lingering ambiguity about cosmic balance. Subtext of collective empathy as redemption feels potent but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through social media's integration with metaphysics. Some phrases ("phantom ache") verge on abstraction, but conceptually fresh framing of regret as quantum weak point maintains originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements fused into cohesive mythos: underwater decay mirrors photograph degradation; parallel timelines justify cosmic stakes. Brevity enhances thematic poignancy despite structural simplicity.</comment>
