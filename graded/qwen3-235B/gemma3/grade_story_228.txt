<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks deep emotional texture; internal monologue remains abstract, motivation is clear but under-explored through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect between storm and discovery, but pacing feels compressed; thematic resolution exists but could deepen the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking atmospheric contrasts (bunker vs. desert), vivid details in the plant’s description, though the setting’s symbolism isn’t fully leveraged.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (clothespin, plant), subtext about self-actualization; emotionally impactful but occasionally veers into abstraction over immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes, but some phrases (“pulse of energy”) feel generic; psychological nuance is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually, but the short length feels limiting; the story’s thematic resonance is clear yet under-elaborated.</comment>
