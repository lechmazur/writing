<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but internal conflict relies too heavily on telling rather than showing. Interactions with the tile and organ lack nuanced emotional complexity that would make the redemption arc more compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but feels compressed. The cause-and-effect relationship between music and tile activation lacks sufficient buildup. The resolution appears abruptly without fully exploiting tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Uses chlorine, stone, and music for sensory texture but fails to fully integrate the bathhouse's historical context with the alien plot. Atmospheric potential remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Employs symbolism (tile as guide) and thematic resonance with fear, but relies too heavily on stated emotions rather than subtext. Tiber's dialogue adds depth but feels underused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shows ingenuity in tying tile activation to music, but contains occasional purple prose. The redemption arc follows a familiar structure. Emotional nuances often feel prescribed rather than organically explored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ideas are promising but execution remains middle-tier. Elements function but lack deeper integration that would create lasting resonance. Feels like draft material rather than polished, publishable work.</comment>
