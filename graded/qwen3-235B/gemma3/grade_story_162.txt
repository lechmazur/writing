<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character shows some clear traits (gambling habits, trustworthiness), but lacks full psychological depth; emotional reactions feel somewhat sketched rather than fully realized within constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from drifting to renewed purpose; pacing well-managed within word limit, though the tape discovery as pivotal moment feels slightly rushed rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory atmosphere created through dust, light and workshop decay; connections between setting and motivation are strong but underexploited for deeper thematic development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("dust motes danced") and emotional undercurrent enhance impact; lacks consistent subtext or layered meaning that would elevate to elite literary standard within the brief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mostly avoids formulaic writing; occasional over-ornate phrases ("fragile thread against vastness of corporate espionage") border on purple prose but don't dominate the narrative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric foundation but lacks definitive thematic punch or distinctive narrative voice that would make it feel essential in competitive literary marketplace; elements feel mostly functional rather than revelatory.</comment>
