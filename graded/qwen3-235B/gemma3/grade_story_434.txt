<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth despite consistent motivation; character's inner conflict and history remain underexplored, though the napkin's significance ties actions to his inherited duty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; pacing is tight but some transitions (e.g., box movement) lack concrete cause-effect clarity, slightly weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich visual texture (mirrors, flickering light) enhances atmosphere, but sensory detail diversity could be expanded; setting-timeframe connection feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (dance of flame as cosmic metaphor) and layered subtext about inherited responsibility elevate impact; occasional "telling" (e.g., "weary eyes") diminishes affect.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through unique mechanics (zero-g illusion), but some descriptors ("playful dread") verge on artificial conceptual pairing; emotional nuance remains subtle rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated organically with thematic purpose; slight predictability in guardian-villain dynamic; conciseness strengthens memorability while allowing thematic resonance about legacy.</comment>
