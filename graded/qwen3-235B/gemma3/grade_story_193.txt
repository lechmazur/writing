<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like Kaelen's sadness and Elara's iconic maps are distinctive but underdeveloped. Motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance; emotional resonance relies on stated feelings more than subtext or action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherence is maintained, with snowstorm and key-turning directly driving the arc. Pacing feels slightly rushed, and the resolution's thematic pivot feels abrupt despite the word limit constraints. Logical cause-effect links are intact but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (sea mist, salted decay) effectively build the "familiar unknown." The setting's symbolic decay aligns with themes, but the Grey Sea and crumbling office could have been more actively integrated into character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mortar-as-listening device introduces memorable symbolism. The ending's quiet hope is emotionally earned, but deeper subtext about connection remains hinted rather than fully realized. Dialogue is purposeful but occasionally exposition-heavy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some atmospheric descriptions ("quiet sadness," "echoes waiting to awaken") border on clich√©, but the mortar's latent function provides a novel twist. Occasional overuse of adjectives ("tarnished key") weakens impact without undermining originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole with minor gaps in integration. The bittersweet resolution suggests thematic depth, though brevity occasionally sacrifices complexity. Stylistic clarity outweighs ornamental excesses.</comment>
