<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (restoring water systems to prevent collapse) is clear but underexplored; Tiber’s isolation-driven actions feel logically consistent but lack emotional depth or contradictory impulses. The blunt scissor’s symbolic role in his resourcefulness strengthens characterization, but the "despairing humor" feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elevator’s arrival drives plot effectively, but the unseen activation of pumps strains internal logic slightly. Cause/effect around the scent influencing systems lacks explanation, yet the tight word limit prioritizes atmosphere over mechanical plausibility. Ending feels abrupt but thematically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion through phosphorescent flora, decaying machinery, and olfactory manipulation. The cavern cathedral’s oppressive humidity and eerie glow deepen isolation. Scent as a nonverbal narrative device ties atmosphere to the concept of control, though some connections between setting and action could be sharper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prompts reflection on control vs. comfort in solitude. Metaphor of scent as manipulation elevates beyond surface plot. Subtext about futile efforts to impose order on decay resonates. Empathy is shown through actions/environment, not exposition. Ending’s ambiguity underscores thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with unique premise (olfactory manipulation, mechanical scissor as symbolic tool). No obvious formulaic phrasing; tone remains consistent. Sensory details are specific, not generic. Tiber’s paradoxical blend of hope and resignation avoids algorithmic predictability. Language is purposeful but occasionally borderlines ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly: isolation (7C), scent (7E-F), and setting (7G) form backbone. Brief length amplifies thematic compression. Lingering questions about agency vs. fate suggest depth. Minor issues: dialogue absence weakens "voice" assessment; slight over-reliance on explanatory phrases ("he insisted to the glowing fungi").</comment>
