<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's loyalty is clear but underexplored; her motivations are consistent yet lack psychological depth. Tiber's role is underdeveloped, serving mostly as a plot device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong opening and thematic conclusion, but middle sections drag. Cause-effect of radicalization is clear, though meditation's resolution feels abrupt and underearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions (city's absence, moths, shadows) masterfully build dread. Setting details like the "moth tower" enhance character introspection effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Potent imagery (roots, voids, moths) carries existential themes. Ending achieves emotional resonance, though some abstract concepts (Weaver's Code) lack narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Radicalization through humor feels conceptually fresh, but atmospheric elements occasionally verge on forced ("sanctified dread" borders on clich√©). Some overwrought metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack innovation. The contemplative tension is compelling, though the 500-word arc leaves thematic depth unrealized.</comment>
