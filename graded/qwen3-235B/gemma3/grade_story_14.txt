<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Characters function as symbols more than individuals; Tiber's desperation and Elara's quiet resignation are evocative, but psychological complexity remains underexplored despite strong contextual integration of traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited scope necessitates compressed structure; the cyclical ritual-to-revelation arc works effectively, though some causal relationships between tidal mechanics and light depletion could be clearer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory-rich environmental storytelling creates oppressive atmosphere; oceanic presence as both literal and metaphorical force masterfully amplifies narrative weight through concrete textures and elemental symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical scaffolding (light as memory, ocean as creditor) elevates material into philosophical territory; emotional resonance emerges through restrained gesture rather than explicit exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√© but occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction at the cost of narrative clarity; symbolic heft compensates for occasional overprecision in imagery selection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion achieved at narrative expense - thematic priorities occasionally strangle emotional immediacy; brevity serves symbolic architecture more effectively than human drama.</comment>
