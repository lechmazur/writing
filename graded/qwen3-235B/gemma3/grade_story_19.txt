<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Predictable arc with thematic endpoint but weak causal linkage between disruption and resolution; pacing uneven in places.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly weighted; dandelions and newborn anchor atmosphere better than mechanical concepts like "precisely random".</comment>
