<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's blunt heresy is shown through defiance and terse actions, but lacks depth beyond stoic resolve; motivation tied to the broken Promise is clear but could explore internal contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with a clear arc (cogâ€™s reappearance to question mark), logical cause-effect, and economical pacing, though some setup details feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (dust motes, shadows, silent temple) but relies on familiar decay tropes; sensory details could be more visceral to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of doubt vs omniscience resonate through precise metaphors (ticker as battleground, teddy bear as symbol of humanity); ending lingers with ambiguity and subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elevates genre tropes with fresh combinations (stock ticker as divine interface, teddy bear as focus object); avoids florid prose but occasionally veers toward conceptual abstraction over lived-in detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere organically to explore tension between free will and control; brevity amplifies thematic focus without feeling constrained; invites reflection beyond the page.</comment>
