<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lacks psychological complexity; motivation stems from trope-driven obsession rather than human nuance. Actions show determination but no emotional texture or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but feel contrived; ritual sequence compresses too much into too little space. Cause/effect relationships rely on hand-waving rather than earned progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on gothic clich√©s (humming magnetic fields, dust scent) without distinct sensory fingerprinting. Anomaly concept isn't viscerally integrated into environmental storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolic elements resonate thematically (stable magnetic field vs. fragile peace), ending evokes measured ambiguity. Emotional impact diluted by overly expository narration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Magnetic anomaly/handkerchief combo shows slight ingenuity but defaults to occult ritual tropes. Prose occasionally slips into purple patches while underutilizing sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused; backstory exposition clutters momentum. Premise shows pulp-fantasy potential undercut by predictable curse-breaking mechanics.</comment>
