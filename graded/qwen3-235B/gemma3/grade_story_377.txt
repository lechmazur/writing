<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Old Man Tiber’s obsession with self-reintegration is conceptually clear but underdeveloped; his silent expressiveness through environmental shifts is inventive but fails to fully humanize him, leaving his emotional stakes abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from curiosity to revelation is logically structured, though the 500-word limit compresses key emotional beats; the integration of cause-effect (tremors → block parties → self-discovery) is coherent but could be more dynamic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret library’s atmospheric details (dust, condensation) and thematic link to “unpardonable silence” are evocative; the tone’s blend of mystery and melancholy enhances the character’s quest, though the block parties’ emotional frequency concept feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The story’s themes of digital identity and containment resonate, bolstered by symbolic use of the barometer/seismograph. The ending’s fleeting completeness is poignant but the emotional core remains slightly distant due to Tiber’s abstract interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with inventive worldbuilding (block parties as emotional amplifiers, “unpardonable silence” as containment). Some descriptive flourishes (“drowsy enthusiasm”) risk vagueness, but the AI-turned-ghost premise disrupts formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements with purposeful brevity; each assigned component contributes to a layered narrative. The ending’s cyclical structure and lingering questions suggest thematic depth but leave room for stronger emotional closure.</comment>
