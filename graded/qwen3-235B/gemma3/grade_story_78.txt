<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characterization is poetic but surface-level; motivations feel philosophically abstract rather than psychologically specific, making Tiber feel more like an archetype than a fully realized person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pacing works in micro-moments but lacks dramatic momentum; the story reaches conceptual completion but struggles to create emotional urgency within the tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uses striking contrasts (green rooftop vs grey ruin) and sensory fragmentation effectively, but the post-apocalyptic setting remains more atmospheric concept than visceral reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness elevates the narrative; the spyglass's function as a memory revealer brilliantly serves thematic goals, with poignant closing imagery that lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in philosophical framing but occasionally relies on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes; emotional landscapes feel genuine but sometimes risk being overtly explained rather than subtly embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists thematically but occasionally strains under the weight of its assigned elements; some components feel conceptually necessary rather than organically integrated.</comment>
