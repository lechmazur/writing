<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The cyber-templar’s motivation to shatter his digital existence’s illusion is clear and consistent, but his internal psyche remains more conceptual than deeply human, leaning on archetypal tropes (rebelling against control) without nuanced emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prism’s refraction is a clever symbolic action driving the plot, and the beginning/end mirror thematic growth (illusion to freedom). However, the abrupt "During reading" line disrupts momentum, and the compressed arc feels rushed despite its coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent sensory details (ozone, leather warmth) and juxtaposition of digital decay with raw nature create a vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere. The sky burial site’s skeletal landscape and relic bridle deepen the tension between artificial and organic existence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (prism as defiance, mirage of safety) and visceral imagery elevate the story into a meditation on agency. The ending balances closure and ambiguity effectively, though the emotional resonance leans intellectual over visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with fresh framing (cyber-templar using analog relics). Sensory details are specific, not generic, and the tone (euphoric agitation) is executed with stylistic restraint. No formulaic phrasing—language is precise, not ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements mesh cohesively to explore control vs. autonomy. The brevity strengthens the impactful theme of transcendent risk-taking. The writing style is purposeful, though the story’s philosophical overtone prevents it from lingering emotionally as deeply as it could.</comment>
