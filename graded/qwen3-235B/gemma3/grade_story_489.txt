<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve traditions is clear but underexplored; the "aggressively kind" attribute lacks integration into personality, and the first-person voice remains enigmatic without sufficient inner conflict or depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on clever connections between the dancer, whale call, and lighthouse awakening, but the tight word limit causes rushed cause-effect transitions (e.g., whale call activating the whistle’s resonance feels underexplained). Pacing uneven but mostly coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse’s decayed grandeur and whale song create mood, but sensory details lack visceral specificity (e.g., seaweed-robed dancers are fleeting). Atmosphere supports themes but needs richer textures to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (whale song as ancestral memory, plastic whistle as cultural bridge) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates thematically, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract character motivations. Central conflict is satisfyingly resolved within constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of modern (plastic whistle) and ancient motifs avoids cliché, but the "haunted lighthouse" trope and Old Man Tiber’s mystic role lean predictable. Fresh use of whale song and dancer’s choreography as plot devices stand out; minimal purple prose but some generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven but unevenly weighted (e.g., the dancer’s unawareness weakens her thematic role). Stylistic clarity balances brief length effectively, leaving a lingering meditation on cultural preservation without over-explaining.</comment>
