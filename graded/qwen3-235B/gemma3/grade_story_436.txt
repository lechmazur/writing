<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (desperate hope for family truths) anchors Tiber’s actions, but limited internal conflict weakens multidimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc, but the brevity compresses emotional stakes; bifurcation and Oracle’s voice resolve effectively within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting evokes vivid imagery (floating fortress, Scorch), but atmospheric details (heat, crumbling library) could deepen mood further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All assigned elements cohere into a resonant, thematically unified narrative; brevity feels intentional but slightly underdevelops emotional peaks.</comment>
