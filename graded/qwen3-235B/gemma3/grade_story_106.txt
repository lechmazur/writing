<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is archetypal; motivations are clear but emotionally underdeveloped, relying on clich√©d "grumpy old man" tropes. The stamps/quilt influence actions, but inner conflicts feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherent but rushed; pivotal moments (storm, quilt discovery) lack space for emotional payoff. Cause/effect between past/future is logical but feels compressed by word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid (dust-choked farm vs. flooded city), but atmospheric details (electrified quilt, ocean pressure) are sketched rather than immersively rendered. Sensory engagement inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Uses potent metaphors (stamps as blueprints; quilt as inheritance) and shows thematic ambition, but execution leans on exposition ("he believed," "he saw") rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conceptually inventive (farm tools in ocean depths; stamps as tech), but certain phrases ("borrowed valor," "pulsed with energy") veer into familiar phrasing. Emotional beats are occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated, but uneven pacing and reliance on familiar emotional arcs limit overall cohesion. Premise is intriguing, but lingering impact undercut by mechanical storytelling.</comment>
