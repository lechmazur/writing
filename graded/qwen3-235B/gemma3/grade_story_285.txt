<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and awkwardness are consistently shown through inaction and symbolic use of the postcard, though motivation could be more complexly developed rather than primarily internal and abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from silence to subtle action, but the tight word limit leaves the middle section underdeveloped and resolution feeling abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, original setting of tundra orchard with geothermal vents enhances theme of bridging worlds, with effective sensory details (steam, cold), though deeper integration with character emotions could strengthen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like hermit crabs and postcards effectively convey theme of incremental change; ending offers hopeful reflection but lacks visceral emotional impact due to overly internalized character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but includes generic phrases ("ephemeral rancor") and slightly predictable structure (silent regret → realization → small hope); prose is occasionally overpolished but not consistently purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively connected but occasionally feel like checklist items rather than organically integrated; length constraints create a vignette-like quality that serves the tone but limits depth.</comment>
