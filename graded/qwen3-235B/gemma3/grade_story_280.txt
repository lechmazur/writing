<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions but lack deeper emotional exploration; Tiber’s strategic obsession is clear, but his internal conflict remains underdeveloped. Elara’s role feels underutilized as a foil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured with logical cause-and-effect, though the sudden resolution feels abbreviated; the snow tracks’ mystery and Elara’s arrival create a coherent arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (isolation, cold, cosmic hum), but the quasar setting’s connection to Tiber’s strategy motif is cursorily explained; sensory details immerse but lack full integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (animal tracks as cosmic strategy) and theme of balance elevate the narrative; the ending’s cyclical return to beeswax kneading reinforces thematic cohesion, though emotional resonance is muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes; avoids purple prose but occasionally relies on abstract descriptors (“magnificent simplicity”); subtext on pattern-seeking is insightful, yet some transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively into a thematically rich whole; length enhances focus, though the brief interaction with Elara weakens the climax’s emotional gravity; lingers as a meditation on order and risk.</comment>
