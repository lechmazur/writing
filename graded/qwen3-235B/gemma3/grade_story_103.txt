<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character’s motivations (penance, regret) are deeply tied to his actions, with symbolic objects revealing psychological depth. Internal conflict is consistent, but emotional nuance could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical arc (remembering/regretting/surrendering), but tight word constraints compress pivotal moments, slightly diluting emotional payoff. Conceptual cohesion is strong, though pacing feels hurried.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere with vivid sensory details (salt, shuddering lighthouse). Mirrors and tides evoke thematic resonance, but the lighthouse’s mechanics (regret-as-structure) lack full environmental integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (objects as emotional anchors) and subtextual themes of self-forgiveness. Ending balances melancholy and transcendence, though the final sentence risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in metaphors (e.g., "joyful agony") and AI-like phrasing ("perpetually of salt and sorrow") borders on cliché. Some transitions feel calculated, but the core premise avoids genre tropes effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere tightly around guilt and redemption, but reliance on abstract concepts risks emotional distance. The ending lingers, though its poetic density may polarize readers.</comment>
