<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to rekindle the realm through brewing is consistent but lacks nuance in Tiber's personal stakes; Lyra's brief inclusion feels underexplored despite touching on shared loss.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but constrained by word limit; Tiber's sweeping and Lyra's sudden appearance connect awkwardly, weakening cause-effect logic and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details (dust motes, cobwebbed consoles) and tone of decay; setting as a "forgotten facility" deepens themes of cultural erosion and memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., "brewing as whispered plea") and subtext about memory add emotional resonance, though ending risks sentimentality. Dialogue hints at deeper conflicts but lacks full realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains generic descriptors ("crisp nostalgia") and slightly formulaic transitions. The blend of brewing and cultural preservation shows ingenuity without feeling derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with precise imagery and thematic consistency. The brevity feels intentional, though some forced phrasing (e.g., "fragile hope blooming") slightly undermines impact.</comment>
