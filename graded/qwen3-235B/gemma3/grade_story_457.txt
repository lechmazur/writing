<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation tied to folklore contradictions is consistent and shapes actions, but personal history remains underexplored. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite introspective monologues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression via annotated legends feels organic, but the tight arc within 500 words leaves some developments underdeveloped. Pacing falters slightly in the latter half.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting evokes sterile order through sparse descriptions ("perfectly manicured parks") but lacks immersive sensory depth. Atmosphere aligns with tone, but worldbuilding feels selectively thin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (raven, zipper) and theme of controlled narratives deliver intellectual resonance. Ending achieves thematic closure but lacks emotional urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creative subversion of "revolution" tropes and folklore critique is strong, but phrases like "slow unraveling" risk poetic abstraction over originality. Subtext feels slightly formulaic in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but occasionally feel checklist-driven (e.g., nebula deckâ€™s atmospheric role underdeveloped). Conceptual ambition transcends length constraints but unevenly executes ideas.</comment>
