<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but surface-level; Tiber's internal conflict is hinted at but lacks deeper psychological nuance. The "endearingly feisty" trait for Hemlock feels underutilized beyond a single line. Consistent actions align with traits, but first-person voice (if present) would strengthen distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by abrupt vine closure as obstacle; pacing feels rushed in midsection. Clear beginning/middle/end exists but relies on contrived plot mechanics. Time-skip concept insufficiently explained within word limit, weakening cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Amazonian treehouse city remains superficially sketched; missed opportunities to integrate ecosystem into atmosphere. Sparse sensory details (e.g., rainforest sounds during ritual) limit immersion. Tone of "playful cynicism" inconsistently applied to setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance in Tiber's sacrifice elevated by closing image of lightened grimoire. Effective metaphors ("shadow of predecessor") and subtext about legacy vs. growth. Some "telling" (e.g., stating exhaustion) weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality undermined by genre tropes (grimoires, time anomalies) with minimal subversion. Flowery phrases ("feisty herbalist") verge on purple prose. Cynical tone feels derivative but execution avoids formulaic character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Element cohesion uneven: Anomaly's mechanics clash with Amazon setting; treehouse city feels incidental. Strong thematic core (responsibility, legacy) unifies key plot points. Ending lingers thematically but lacks narrative innovation.</comment>
