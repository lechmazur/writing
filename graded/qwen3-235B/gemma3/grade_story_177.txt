<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually strong (rebellious preservationist), but lacks emotional depth; reactions to objects (tyrant's book) feel performative rather than psychologically nuanced. The mask's influence on his psyche remains underexplored despite its thematic significance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression through labyrinthine choices creates tension, but the resolution feels abrupt; the revolutionary stakes introduced early don't meaningfully intersect with the sanctuary Elias creates, weakening the cause/effect framework within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile sensory details (cool ceramic masks, pulsing organ vibrations) and metaphorical setting connections (shifting Bookshelf reflecting ideological tides). The revolution's influence on specific sensory choices (gilt decay, resonant silence) could have been stronger.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elicits emotional engagement through symbolic metaphors (mask as emotional palimpsest), but thematic exploration of "defiant life" vs. revolution risks intellectual abstraction over visceral impact. Subtext about art as resistance is present but under-complicated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in blending mythic elements (giant's archives) with psychological symbolism, but occasionally slips into ornate adverbial scaffolding ("radiant smile, then tearful plea") instead of earned emotional nuance. Avoids formulaic progression but doesn't fully transcend genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uneven cohesion; labyrinth concept and mask integrate strongly, while revolutionary context feels tacked-on rather than organically connected to Elias' private sanctuary. The brevity works thematically but sacrifices narrative complexity required for prestige-level literary impact.</comment>
