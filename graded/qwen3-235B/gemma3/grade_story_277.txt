<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited character development due to static emotional arc; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced psychological depth. The archivist's actions align with curiosity but lack visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect through labyrinth interaction but pacing stumbles slightly during abstract revelation. The fractured-to-wholeness arc satisfies but feels compressed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in the workshop's decay and geometric symbolism elevates the tone. The juxtaposition of grandeur with quiet emptiness creates haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Masterfully layered metaphors (coin purse as grief, labyrinth as plea) deepen the elegiac theme. Ending achieves emotional resonance through understated philosophical shift rather than dramatic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic fantasy tropes by subverting "giant's treasure" expectations. Language balances poetic precision with emotional restraint; the labyrinth's narrative function feels fresh rather than archetypal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Every element contributes to the central metaphor. The concise format enhances thematic poignancy, leaving lingering questions about creativity's cyclical nature. Style serves substance without excess.</comment>
