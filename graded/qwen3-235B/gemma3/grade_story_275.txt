<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear (defiance against decay via preservation) and generally consistent with his actions, but interiority feels abstracted; Tiber's motivations are conveyed through poetic reflection rather than lived human experience, diluting emotional weight despite strong symbolic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves complete arc within constraints—starts with translation method, pivots to memory-based solution, ends with hopeful renewal. Minor pacing lag in middle; relies on conceptual progression rather than character-driven conflict, which weakens emotional urgency but aligns with meditative tone.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully integrated—the burned comet, skeletal trees, and weathervane create a haunting, tangible atmosphere where memory and decay are physical forces. Sensory details (sight of crimson smear, texture of withered branches) make abstract themes visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story evokes profound melancholy through motif of preservation as rebellion. Uses metaphor (flowers as "mindful choices") and symbolism (comet/orchard dyad) with precision. Ending's quiet triumph avoids sentimentality but could deepen thematic payoff regarding "composition with decay."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés (hermit as "curator of endings"), employs original metaphors ("deliberate wilderness"). Some phrases verge on ornate ("whispers of the land itself") but generally maintain purposeful lyricism. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolic actions rather than direct expression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively: weathervane guides translations that reveal the orchard's need for remembrance, resolving the character's motivation through atmospheric logic. Brief length works thematically—fragmented renewal mirrors the story's structure of "unfurling" in stages.</comment>
