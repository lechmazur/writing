<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivations (childhood shadows, silence as shield) are hinted but lack psychological depth; Elias' reactions to horror are under-explained despite atmospheric cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc is compressed but coherent; pivotal discovery of blood cult feels rushed, sacrificing cause-effect clarity for Gothic atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through paradoxical character profession and botanical horror twist; occasional purple prose ("gothic silhouette") mars otherwise fresh approach.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around central metaphor with deliberate, unsettling tone; thematic unity outweighs minor pacing flaws in tight word count.</comment>
