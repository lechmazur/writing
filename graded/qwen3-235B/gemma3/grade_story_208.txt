<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations (regret, cosmic humor) are clear and connected to actions, but emotional nuances beyond surface-level grief remain underdeveloped despite mournful trombone motif.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with beginning-middle-end progression, but the 400-word constraint occasionally flattens emotional beats, particularly in the transition from despair to hopeful realization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid mechanical atmosphere (smell of dust, conveyor belts mirroring life choices) powerfully evokes melancholy, though the suitcase's symbolic weight isn't fully integrated into the setting's sensory fabric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (postal algorithms=decisions, backward pen=regret) are ingeniously layered, with the trombone's bittersweet melody serving as a masterful emotional counterpoint to mechanical surroundings.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids AI-generated clich√©s through highly specific imagery (e.g., "phantom address leading to astronomy life") and subverts melancholy tropes with the cosmic humor motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively around regret-as-redemption theme; the brief length amplifies poignancy but slightly underdevelops secondary symbols like the suitcase's connection to timeframes.</comment>
