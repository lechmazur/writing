<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity and cosmic role are well-defined but motivations lack psychological depth; interactions reveal traits but not layered reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Meandering progression of cosmic "adjustments" lacks explicit stakes or conflict; coherence exists but the plot feels more like a vignette than a completed arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original metaphysical machinery avoids genre tropes; some phrases ("lonely symphony") risk pretension but imaginative core salvages style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a contemplative whole; brevity works intentionally to emphasize philosophical undertones over narrative resolution.</comment>
