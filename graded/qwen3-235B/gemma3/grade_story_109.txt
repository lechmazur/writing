<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation for folk remedies is clear but underexplored. Emotional shift via mitten feels earned but could use deeper internal conflict. Consistent actions but limited voice distinctness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot driven by mitten and altars but feels compressed. Connection between remedies and rebellion lacks weight. Pacing uneven; emotional climax feels rushed despite tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nighttime intersection evokes atmosphere through shadows and silence. Altars add eerie undertones but insufficiently explained. Mitten’s tactile detail (wool) contrasts with knightly rigidity, enhancing sensory impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imperfect sketching as metaphor for fractured healing resonates. Subtext about historical erasure (altars) aligns with theme. Ending connects to character shift but lacks visceral emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Knight-with-hidden-pain trope is familiar. Some clichés (“raw aching grief”) undercut nuance. Altars-as-rebellion concept shows ingenuity but blends uneasily with folk remedy motif. Language avoids purple prose but skirts formulaism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements (altars, mitten) create cohesion but some (secret agency) feel extraneous. Short length emphasizes emotional pivot but weakens theme development. Lingering image (mitten) lingers stronger than thematic resonance.</comment>
