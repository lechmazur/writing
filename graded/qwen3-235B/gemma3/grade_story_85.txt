<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematically consistent but underdeveloped; Tiber's internal logic follows from his stated traits, but his static, symbolic nature prevents genuine emotional investment. The swordsman's role feels tacked on, with his weapon becoming irrelevant by the climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot maintains structural coherence through the theme of realization-as-action, but the word limit forces rushed philosophical shifts. The connection between beginning (seeking wisdom) and end (accepting impermanence) works conceptually, though the pivotal "fleeting moment" lacks visceral progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The petrified forest creates a vivid, conceptually rich atmosphere with strong visual and tactile details (stone textures, silent symphony), but emotional connection is diluted by overly abstract descriptions. The setting supports themes but occasionally becomes a static backdrop rather than an active force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and symbolism (forest as cyclical wisdom, schematic as map of potential) creates layered meaning. The ending resonates thematically but borders on didacticism. Writing style's lyrical precision enhances mood, though occasional "telling" about emotions slightly weakens the show-don't-tell principle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in reimagining "doomsday device" as evolution catalyst, avoiding genre tropes. Avoids purple prose through precise imagery but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction ("petrified symphony") that feels more concept-driven than emotionally grounded. Subtlety occasionally becomes vague obfuscation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious with strong thematic cohesion, but tension between poetic abstraction and character immediacy weakens overall impact. The brevity works for philosophical epiphany but sacrifices narrative urgency. Leaves intellectual resonance rather than lingering emotional impressions.</comment>
