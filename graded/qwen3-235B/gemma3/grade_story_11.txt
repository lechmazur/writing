<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's flightiness and cartography background remain underexplored; the grease-stained overalls memento缺乏 emotional resonance; motivation for legacy feels stated rather than dramatized through consequential actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on repetitive image-analysis sequence; initiation task drives narrative but lacks stakes; resolution feels perfunctory despite tight word count; gear symbol emerges logically but without dramatic weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Beeswax aroma and echoing hall create evocative atmosphere; secret society's waxed-floor aesthetic clashes with grease-stained mechanics; warm/cool sensory dichotomy enhances theme but slightly inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gear motif effectively symbolizes hidden unity; "serene anger" juxtaposition creates inner conflict; ending avoids grandiosity but trades emotional impact for philosophical abstraction; "showing" through object repetitions outweighs "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through abstract metaphysical puzzle; sensory details (locket gear, church steeple) remain specific; avoids excessive ornamentation; emotional nuance emerges through tactile reactions (thumb on overalls) rather than explicit declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements form cohesive thematic lattice; time constraint handled through repetitive yet purposeful progression; writing style prioritizes conceptual clarity over linguistic pyrotechnics; leaves contemplative residue about perception and connection.</comment>
