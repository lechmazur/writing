<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than shown; motivations for honoring the forgotten are clear but lack psychological depth. The rebellious past doesn't significantly inform current actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear puzzle-solving structure but feels compressed in the word limit. The resolution ties beginning/end together thematically rather than action-wise, creating cohesion but sacrificing fully realized progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric verbs ("rusted," "lengthened") and recurring ivy motif create mood. Sensory details are present but occasionally generalized; the rusted sundial as tactile anchor works well but feels isolated in the worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evokes melancholy through tactile objects (crumbling wax, pressed flower) rather than exposition. The metaphor of constellations as both cosmic and forgotten lives connects plot to theme, but emotional "showing" weakens in the final reflective paragraphs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through emphasis on mundane decay (rusted brass, ivy) over gothic tropes. Some transitional phrases ("a sense that this wasn't about...") veer toward abstraction over precision but overall maintains distinctive stylistic control and thematic originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements service theme over spectacle, but integration varies in effectiveness. The brevity feels deliberate for meditative pacing rather than constraint, though the ending's thematic summation slightly overexplains prior subtleties.</comment>
