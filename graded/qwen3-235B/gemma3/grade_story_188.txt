<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but under-explored; the lawman past feels symbolic rather than deeply integrated into his actions or psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc, but the 500-word constraint creates uneven pacing; some transitions between meditation and action feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is evocative with sensory details (cherry blossoms, raked gravel), but the ancient castle’s cultural specificity feels generic rather than deeply researched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (spectacles as fractured self) and lyrical prose elevate emotional resonance, but the redemption theme leans on predictable tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Gathering broken pieces and the misplaced letter border on cliché; symbolism is effective but not subversive, with some overwrought phrases (“corroded rapture”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coheres superficially around assigned elements, but lacks structural innovation; brief length feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
