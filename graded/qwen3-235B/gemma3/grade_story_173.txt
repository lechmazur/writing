<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits of being more comfortable with nature than people are present but underexplored; motivation to preserve connections is stated but lacks visceral emotional grounding to fully justify actions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from preparation to resolution, but pacing feels compressed; some plot elements (phantom hand’s intervention) lack sufficient setup to avoid slight plot convenience</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details like expectant water and spectral touch; setting effectively reinforces thematic contrasts between organic growth and bureaucratic remnants</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors connect multiverse to gardening create intellectual resonance; ending achieves thematic closure but risks sentimentality with “bittersweet weight,” undercutting full emotional authenticity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending orchardist skills with interdimensional restoration; avoids genre clichés through lyrical precision but occasionally leans on stock tropes (barnacle-encrusted nostalgia) without subversion</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>All elements serviceable, but kitchen table motif is most cohesively integrated; brevity emphasizes thematic unity while sacrificing deeper exploration of paradoxical orchardist-explorer duality</comment>
