<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a guardian of beauty is present but underdeveloped; his sudden destructive act lacks psychological nuance; dialogue absence weakens voice clarity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot has conceptual arc (silent custodian to symbolic destruction) but feels rushed; cause-effect between Thorne's speech and hair clip snapping lacks emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Lab/research element feels superficially referenced; wedding restaurant atmosphere clashes with "primal sophistication"; sparse sensory detail weakens immersion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><comment>Elements mostly functional but not fully integrated; story's brevity reveals structural gaps (e.g., Lyra's underdeveloped role); thematically provocative but execution uneven.</comment>
