<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters show clear traits but lack deeper nuance; Tiber’s cartographic past ties to his cosmic search but Aris remains rigidly clinical without sufficient evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured but relies on abrupt shifts; the forge method feels forced, yet the dialogue-driven resolution aligns with the word constraint’s demands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie contrast between sterile hospital and primal forge enhances atmosphere; sensory details (dragonfly, clang) evoke mood but cosmic-scale worldbuilding lacks depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (dragonfly, forge) and cosmic subtext elevate impact; dialogue conveys tension but occasionally over-explains themes like “corrupted innocence” without subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story avoids predictable tropes with cosmic corruption angle but falters with clinical doctor archetype; forge method feels contrived despite thematic weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mix of inspired (dragonfly, Corvus Rift) and awkward (forge, Aris’s pivot) elements; cohesive in concept but uneven in execution under tight constraints.</comment>
