<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character development is surface-level; Tiber's tremors and regret feel underexplored despite clear motivation. His actions align with traits but lack emotional depth or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but perfunctory. The exchange drives the narrative, but pacing feels rushed. Resolution is abrupt, lacking tension buildup or nuanced payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid, eerie atmosphere through decayed cathedral details and candlelight metaphors. Sensory elements enhance the theme of suspended time, though not fully leveraged for deeper emotional immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., "iridescent scales" as a map) and thematic resonance of seeking self through the unknown. Emotional impact lingers but could deepen via subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors (amber as "suspended time"), but formulaic phrases ("echoing hour") and tropes (haunted mercenary) dilute originality. Tone remains consistent but occasionally veers into poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack inventive synergy. The mercenary's arc feels inevitable rather than surprising. Style is purposeful yet lacks the daring precision required for elite publishability.</comment>
