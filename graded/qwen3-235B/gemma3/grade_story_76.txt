<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s quiet persistence is shown, but motivation feels stated rather than deeply internalized; emotional layers remain underdeveloped despite thematic consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear resolution or conflict escalation; pacing is leisurely but maintains coherence within its vignette-style structure, though the arc feels incomplete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail and atmospheric cohesion elevate the setting; fog as metaphor for censorship and decay enhances mood and theme effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery and subtext (e.g., fragmented texts = fragmented memories) add depth; ending is poetic but underwhelming as a narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés; "fierce repose" and abstract descriptors risk vagueness, but inventive use of warped reading as a conceit offsets minor awkwardness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive atmosphere and theme but lacks taut tension or closure; relies on lyrical prose over narrative urgency, balancing on the edge of publishability.</comment>
