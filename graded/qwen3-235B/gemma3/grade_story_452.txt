<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character traits are inconsistently realized; "softhearted" doesn't clearly manifest in actions beyond case selection. Motivation is abstract yet consistent; belt's significance is stated rather than demonstrated. Subtle cosmic agency lacks emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Linear progression with cosmic interference drives plot. Planetarium method logically connects to outcome but lacks technical detail. Beginning/end circularity through rain/belt effective. Pacing tight but some underdeveloped cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Neon-drenched cyberpunk atmosphere masterfully rendered through sensory details. Planetarium's ozone/dust contrasts with rain-soaked streets. Belt buckle as physical metaphysical anchor deepens setting. Timeframe's "end of storytelling" concept enhances melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like cosmic weaving show promise but remain surface-level. Theme of rewriting fate lacks philosophical depth. Ending feels familiar rather than revelatory. Emotional impact understated; relies on imagery over visceral character reaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by merging cosmic mysticism with cyberpunk. Organic energy concept and constellation manipulation feel novel. Prose occasionally overadorned but maintains voice consistency. Subtext about free will vs. determinism hinted but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative machine. Concise form serves thematic compression. Final reflection on "predetermined sorrow" lingers but lacks transformative punch. Style enhances rather than obscures concept delivery.</comment>
