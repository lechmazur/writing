<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has distinctive traits but motivations and inner conflicts lack sufficient development; "fickle loyalty" feels underexplored, and actions occasionally strain believability despite intriguing quirks like the belt connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing feels rushed during climax; the ionization method and film reel gimmick drive plot effectively, yet the resolution lacks emotional payoff proportional to the stakes introduced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sparse sensory details and underdeveloped setting atmosphere limit immersion; high altitude tea house's mineral energy field is referenced but not vividly realized, and the contrast between yak documentary banality and hidden phenomena is only superficially exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Memorable conceptual hooks (carnivorous plant antennae, film reel ionization) generate intrigue, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on tell-don't-show descriptions; the central conflict between ambition and collaboration remains thematically undercooked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique combinations (film projections + carnivorous plants), but moments of excessive adjectives ("comically serious," "twitching plants") border on purple prose; character psychology feels more curated than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Successfully integrates all elements into a coherent narrative, though some (like the yak documentary) feel peripherally included; brevity serves the enigmatic tone but sacrifices deeper exploration of philosophical implications about knowledge hoarding.</comment>
