<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Average motivation (guilt/redemption) drives action, but lacks psychological complexity. Character's reverence for violin reveals depth, but consistent melancholic tone doesn't evolve into meaningful transformation. Sparse emotional interiority despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Circular structure (museum descent/rebirth journey) works within constraints, but transitional "ruin to ruin" montage feels rushed. Clear cause-effect (malfunction → quest), yet pacing imbalance between atmospheric details and narrative progression. Underdeveloped middle section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Strong architectural imagery (gilded cage temple, floating museum) contrasts with underdeveloped jungle elements. Atmospheric details (frost/music metaphors) effective, but sensory scope narrow - over-reliance on sight/metaphorical textures rather than full-world immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in shifting ice violin and memory-as-life-force concept. Ending avoids trite resolution through "potential rather than restoration" theme. Emotional resonance undercut by heavy-handed descriptive scaffolding; could show more through concrete interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI traps with unique metaphors ("dull radiance of guilt"), but contains minor purple patches ("fragile hope woven into tapestry of sorrow"). Some repetitive rhythm in explanatory phrases. Tropes (lonely custodian, magic artifact) subverted through ecological themes rather than generic redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (ice violin ↔ memory ↔ salvation) but uneven execution. Short form serves cyclical meditation on memory well, but ambitious themes of ecological rebirth feel truncated. Lingering conceptual questions about "songseeds" mechanics and ethical implications of "repopulation" remain unexplored.</comment>
