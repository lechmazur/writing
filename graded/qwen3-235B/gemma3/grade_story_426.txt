<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, but internal conflicts could be more nuanced. The 'angrily peaceful' trait informs actions but isn't deeply explored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc but feels compressed; cause-effect relationships are logical yet occasionally rushed. The connection between beginning/end lacks emotional payoff despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (rust, phantom music), but some elements like the park’s decay could be more tightly tethered to character motivations or themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges from the teapot symbolism and ritual, but dialogue-free storytelling relies heavily on exposition. Subtext about legacy and preservation adds depth but feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grammar><comment>The fusion of music-as-data and ley lines is inventive; however, 'bizarre playlists' border on technical jargon. Some phrases ('phantom calliope music') verge on cliché but avoid full predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the story occasionally feels like a framework rather than a fully realized narrative. Emotional closure is satisfying but not lingering.</comment>
