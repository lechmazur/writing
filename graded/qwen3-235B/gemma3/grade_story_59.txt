<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character motivations and traits are consistent; the embroidery collar and star-trail method effectively tie into his grief. Emotional transformation is clear but slightly rushed in such a short span.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with a clear arc, but the pivotal star deviation feels abrupt. Pacing is efficient but lacks gradual build-up to the emotional climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting details (abandoned domes, silence) and sensory elements (brass astrolabe, collar's weight) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that deepens both character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (star trails as grief cycles) and lyrical prose. Ending avoids sentimentality, delivering emotional resonance through understated acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s by merging cosmic imagery with personal loss. The star deviation as a plot device feels freshly invented, and the tone avoids overused "gothic grief" tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All assigned elements are cohesively integrated. The short form complements the story's introspective focus. Ending leaves a lingering emotional and philosophical impact.</comment>
