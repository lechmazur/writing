<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's daydreaming nature shapes his obsession and isolation, but lacks emotional depth or conflicting motivations beyond his stated goal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean cause-effect chain between satellite shard, skating rink decoding, and palace resonance. Slight pacing bump in technical explanation of harmonic frequencies.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral descriptions of algae-trailing lake, humming stones, and ethereal glow create haunting yet hopeful atmosphere that mirrors the "pristine chaos" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (scuff marks as visual poems, frequencies as psychic resonance) elevate theme. Ending achieves emotional resonance but explicitly states "compassion" when imagery implies it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh twist on cursed palace trope through non-verbal, non-linear storytelling. Some near-purple prose ("trailing algae of Lake Cocytus") but generally purposeful language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interweave cohesively (satellite data driving both plot and theme), though the "masterpiece" motivation feels overly grandiose compared to subtle storytelling.</comment>
