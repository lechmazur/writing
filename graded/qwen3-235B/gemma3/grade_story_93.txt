<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority; motivations (ambition, evasion) are abstract but actions poorly grounded in human psychology. No distinct voice in third-person narration. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clever plot mechanics (evasive geometry, pirate radio hacking) but truncated payoff; cause-effect chain rushed in final 100 words, weakening narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Archival chill, static-charged server room, and spiraling motifs create mood, but setting details remain decorative rather than thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (nautilus as ancient language; echo cities) and layered conflict (creation vs control), though emotional stakes remain diffuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh interplay of sacred geometry and surveillance evasion, but repetitive "foreign" agent trope; purple prose ("fragile promise of salvation") mars precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive worldbuilding but overly reliant on conceptual scaffoldingâ€”elements service theme more than character/plot; length amplifies structural gaps.</comment>
