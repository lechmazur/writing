<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions and assigned traits, but lacks deeper psychological complexity; voice is distinct yet occasionally over-explains emotions rather than embedding them subtly in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; causes/effects logically tied but resolution feels slightly rushed; pacing maintains momentum without sacrificing coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (lunar ash, fog texture) enhance isolation; atmosphere of "charred serenity" deeply entwined with character motivations and setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and subtext effectively (e.g., fear's companion as resilience); ending avoids neatness, leaving thematic resonance; emotional impacts shown but occasionally told, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (e.g., "burning" fear) and original premise avoid tropes; no formulaic phrases; tone remains consistent but occasionally leans on ornate description at expense of forward motion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements synergize beautifully to explore collective trauma; brevity enhances urgency; thematic cohesion and lingering emotional resonance suggest masterful craftsmanship.</comment>
