<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is consistent (Tiber's duty) and shows a believable arc from apathy to reluctant empathy. However, the emotional shift feels slightly rushed and could use more nuanced internal conflict portrayal to fully justify the transformation. The grumpy voice remains cohesive but lacks layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear structure (summons-task-execution-resolution) and maintains cause-effect logic within its framework. Pacing is mostly effective, but the middle could be tightened to enhance momentum. The beginning-to-end connection works thematically but feels compressed in execution, occasionally sacrificing emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (lavender, shifting mandala) create atmosphere, but the juxtaposition of the scrying room against the crypt feels underdeveloped. The setting meaningfully connects to themes but occasionally loses atmospheric richness through overly abstract descriptions. Cosmic dust and stargazing add texture but could be more consistently evocative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (trauma as cosmic dust, healing through redistribution) are powerful. The theme of collective memory and empathy resonates. While emotional impact is effective, the ending could deepen its philosophical implications. The central conflict's resolution feels purposeful but under-exploits subtext about the role of memory in healing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with cosmic trauma concept and unmarked tube as metaphor. Some phrases ("shimmering amethyst") border on purple prose but remain purposeful. Character reasoning avoids over-logic through visceral sensory experiences, though emotional nuance still leans slightly descriptive over experiential. The mandala-as-method is inventive but occasionally explained rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative, though transformation arc feels concise rather than expansive. The brevity highlights intentional compression rather than limitation, with lingering thoughts about memory's weight. Thematic coherence and emotional economy work well, but the story's ambition slightly outpaces what the word count permits for fully immersive resonance.</comment>
