<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but occasionally abstract; Jax's "meticulous impulsiveness" influences his actions but lacks concrete behavioral manifestations. His empathy drive is clear but under-explored beyond philosophical musings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot cohesion is strong conceptually but strained by brevity; cause-effect between butterfly-trigger and drought prediction is logical, but Vance's role feels underdeveloped. Pacing maintains momentum despite compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere excel through arid imagery and symbolic resonance; Dust Belt and DPC create palpable tension. Sensory details ("charged air," "crimson skies") deepen immersion without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Storytelling shines with layered themes of empathy and memory; metaphors (butterfly fragility, music as memory) enrich subtext. Ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic convergence rather than mere plot resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is strong with fresh conceptualization of weather prediction through subconscious memory; avoids clich√©s despite surreal premise. Language remains precise without purple prose, though some abstract phrases risk vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story coalesces effectively around assigned elements; brevity serves thematic focus rather than hindering it. Unique integration of empathy-as-method elevates beyond conventional sci-fi tropes, leaving lingering contemplation on human-land connection.</comment>
