<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (refusal of binary roles) and symbolic actions (limp, cat following) align cohesively, but psychological depth remains somewhat surface-level despite strong thematic grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc (cat-led journey to philosophical resolution) functions within constraints, but minimalist structure lacks layered tension; the inciting action (disguise) receives insufficient causal development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Black Hole Resort" creates rich thematic dissonance through juxtaposed decay/luxury, but sensory details (e.g., coal scent) could resonate more deeply with the savage bliss tone and existential themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric weight/anvil balance and "unraveling thread" imagery elevate subtext; ending achieves thematic closure but sacrifices emotional resonance for conceptual elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through nuanced middle-path existentialism; occasional overly arch phrasing ("poetically bland observer") borders on contrived, but conceptual innovation prevails.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements (cats, disguise, anvil) organically serve thematic momentum; brevity enhances philosophical purity but dilutes character immersion and emotional stakes.</comment>
