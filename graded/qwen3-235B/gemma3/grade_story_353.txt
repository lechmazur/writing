<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has surface-level traits but lacks depth in connecting his cynically gentle nature to pivotal actions; motivation is present but under-explored, with inconsistent showing of internal logic behind his rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is clear but feels constrained by word limit, with abrupt transitions between time travel prep and execution; pacing is uneven, though the core concept drives momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends mundane bakery and mystical time travel effectively, but underdeveloped sensory details and thin integration of setting with thematic contrast limit immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphorical seeds and subtext about controlling narratives elevates impact; ending is purposeful but emotional stakes lack depth, leaving the “waiting” section underwhelming.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with moon-powered time machines and floral rebellion; prose remains concise and purposeful. Some phrases (“quiet rage at sterile perfection”) approach generic descriptors, diluting otherwise fresh ideas.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive fusion of elements creates a thematically rich parable about resistance; constrained form prioritizes concept over emotional payoff, weakening narrative lingering compared to its conceptual ambition.</comment>
