<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a map-maker is consistent, but conscientious objector backstory lacks integration; "valiantly bored" is stated but not deeply demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot builds coherently around trail of evidence, but the shift from neighborhood watch data to nail discovery feels slightly rushed; resolution is purposeful but compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard creates vivid, eerie atmosphere; sensory details like bruised purple and gold flora enhance mood, but holiday tradition's connection to setting remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses strong imagery ("orchard held its breath") and subtext about silent power, but emotional impact is limited by sparse character interiority; thematically rich but inconsistently affecting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through unique fusion of folk-tradition surveillance and ecological cryptid mystery; language remains purposeful, though "coy malevolence" borders on forced phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole despite tight constraints; Samhain tradition and conscientious objection feel marginally extraneous, but craft fairs and rusted nail demonstrate innovative integration.</comment>
