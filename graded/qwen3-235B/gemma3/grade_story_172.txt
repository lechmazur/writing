<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation and actions are tightly linked, but inner depth lacks complexity despite effective use of symbolic objects to reveal backstory. Stoic portrayal works against deeper emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Careful pacing within constraints creates cohesive arc from pursuit to resolution. Some transitions between backstory and present action feel slightly compressed, but celestial alignment mechanic provides clear causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory contrasts between bleached seashell and shimmering ruins establish mood. Atmospheric elements like amplified clicks complement thematic gravity but require tighter integration with prophecy mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (reverse engineering legacy, heroism through self-erasure) create profound impact. Ending's quiet transcendence elevates theme beyond surface plot through carefully layered subtext about consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Twist on traditional heroism avoids tropes. Specificity of mechanical wish reversal breaks formulaic expectations. Some phrases ("echoing ruin," "desperate reversed wish") verge on poetic abstraction rather than visceral language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements synergize to create philosophical narrative exploring legacy's weight. Brief length accentuates cyclical structure, though timeframe connection to archive photo requires greater contextual development for full cohesion.</comment>
