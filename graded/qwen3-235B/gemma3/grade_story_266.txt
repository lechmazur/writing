<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weak secondary characterization; Tiber's actions align with his bleak worldview but lack psychological depth beyond surface eccentricity. Dialogue feels performative rather than revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has circular coherence rather than progression; tension arises from thematic repetition rather than cause-effect logic. Fragmented segments create artificial "arc."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details like the studio's tilt and charcoal poetry immerse readers. Floating rock conceit strains believability but enhances thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor and subtext; clock hand symbolism and dawn imagery linger. Subversive philosophical themes challenge while maintaining emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into stylized grotesquerie ("jagged generosity"). Metaphors like chipped-tooth smile show ingenuity but verge on self-conscious cleverness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Elements cohere superficially but strain under scrutiny—floating rock and train juxtaposition feel checklist-engineered rather than organically integrated into narrative logic.</comment>
