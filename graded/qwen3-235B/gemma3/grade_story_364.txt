<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underexplored; Tiber's communication through sketches is inventive but lacks emotional depth or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression from fragmented pottery to Prague location is logical but feels compressed; emotional payoff is undercut by narrative efficiency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting effectively blends clinical anomalous research with poetic decay; the silent revolution and Prague's mundane miracle anchor the atmosphere without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (botanical art as language, pottery fragments as temporal maps); ending achieves lyrical resonance but struggles with balancing abstraction and narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar melancholic genius tropes; metaphors like "entropy of the universe" risk pretension while imagery remains vivid and distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ambitious integration of elements creates thematic cohesion, though some concepts (e.g., temporal entropy) remain underdeveloped; the ending lingers effectively.</comment>
