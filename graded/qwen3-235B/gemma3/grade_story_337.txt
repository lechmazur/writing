<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative progresses through procedural actions but lacks tangible stakes or meaningful transformation; plot structure feels episodic rather than purposefully shaped, with underdeveloped tension and resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory texture and atmospheric coherence elevate the setting; however, the kaleidoscope design studio’s thematic potential remains underutilized beyond decorative motifs.</comment>
