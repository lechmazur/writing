<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation to master silence is clear but underdevelops character's emotional complexity. Actions align with traits but lack nuanced psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resisting via hijacked messages drives the plot, but the tight structure leaves little room for rising tension. Pacing manages coherence but feels slightly rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bioluminescent jellyfish city creates vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details enhance tone, though deeper ecological and cultural textures could enrich worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subtext about silent resistance and truth manipulation elevates themes. Lyrical prose and symbolic objects (hammer, algae) create emotional resonance and layered meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original setting avoids genre tropes, but street wisdom and resistance arcs occasionally veer into familiar territory. Language is purposeful, though some metaphors could refine further.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elegant integration of assigned elements into a cohesive narrative. Brief length feels intentional but lacks fully resolved thematic payoff. Lingers as a striking vignette.</comment>
