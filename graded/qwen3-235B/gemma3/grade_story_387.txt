<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong motivation and clear traits for Tiber; Kael’s conversion lacks nuance but serves thematic purpose. Actions align with assigned traits; distinct voices present but secondary character underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently with central conflict driving action. Resolution feels slightly rushed but maintains coherence. Assigned elements (lunge, wind chimes) shape key beats; pacing balanced but arc compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Richly immersive setting with vivid sensory details (sound of chimes, salvaged cushions). Timeframe and recycled spaceship enhance tone; atmosphere deeply tied to themes of decay and legacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic resonance (songs as maps, trust residue). Ending resolves conflict thematically but could deepen subtext. Conflict introduces tension efficiently; theme of connection versus exploitation clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés with inventive worldbuilding. Some phrases border on ornate ("indifferent darkness") but not excessive. Kael’s shift feels abrupt but intentional; emotional nuance present but unevenly weighted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into cohesive whole; length serves brevity over constraint. Creative use of sensory motifs and thematic contrasts. Leaves lingering resonance through metaphorical map-as-connection concept.</comment>
