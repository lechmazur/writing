<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the tortured past is stated rather than dramatized. Internal conflict lacks nuance, though actions align with stated goals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels rushed during cosmic transition. The beginning-middle-end arc exists within constraints, yet cause/effect progression lacks emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere well-established through sensory details (dust, light, porcelain texture). Setting-object connection strong, though tonal shifts between "playful seriousness" and cosmic awe feel disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "fractured porcelain dawn") elevate the prose, but emotional impact remains surface-level. Theme of liberation vs. control resonates, though subtext feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality exists in concept (protector as cosmic beacon) but execution leans on tropes: haunted past, mystical doll, ethereal woman. Language occasionally slips into poetic clichés ("cosmic giggle") without fresh subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated. The planetarium encounter and "dawn’s second breath" feel forced. Tight word economy works for atmospheric snapshots but sacrifices depth.</comment>
