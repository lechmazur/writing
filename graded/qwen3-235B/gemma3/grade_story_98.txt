<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness is undercut by decisive actions, creating engaging contradiction. Motivation through lost research is clear but underexplored; ruler ritual reveals obsessive determination beneath timidity, but emotional complexity remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing falters in tight word-count: ritual mechanics overwhelm character stakes. Assigned tapestry method drives plot but feels disconnected from dog walking framing. Clear connection between opening and initiation chamber, but thematic payoff feels rushed in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between mundane dog walker setting and occult atmosphere work exceptionally well. Oil-lit chamber lacks visceral sensory details beyond visuals. Tapestry's light-play enriches both world-building and plot mechanics, but emotional temperature remains cool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden ruler revelation creates potent storytelling impact. Dual-layered tension between public/private worlds maintains engagement. Ending lacks definitive emotional punch despite strong thematic throughline about fragile constructs of knowledge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through melancholic introspection. "Plastic ruler" choice is subversively mundane. Some transitions (golden retriever tug to mystical entrance) strain credibility. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolic objects rather than stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion survives element stacking through tapestry-as-unifier. Each assigned piece serves purpose, but dog walking context feels more like clever framing than essential component. Final revelation lacks visceral resonance despite conceptual strength.</comment>
