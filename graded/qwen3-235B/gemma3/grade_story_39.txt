<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Restlessness and deception define Tiber, but motivations lack visceral depth; his actions feel narratively convenient rather than psychologically grounded. The stitch altering perception is underexplored as a transformative act.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear rescue narrative, but the shift from observation to action lacks tension. The terraforming core's reintroduction feels abrupt; the historian's arc could be tighter. Pacing balances urgency and introspection unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid Martian grit and biodome decay immerse readers, but secondary settings like the hidden chamber lack specificity. The connection between the lantern's temporal reverberation and Martian atmosphere remains underelaborated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The metaphor of mending as hope resonates, but emotional impact is diluted by passive prose. Themes of endurance and manipulation are clear but lack subversion; the ending leans on sentimental resolution rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi with temporal mystery; avoids cloying clichés. However, Tiber’s "performance" as a deceiver relies on overused tropes ("small knowing smile"). Prose is occasionally overwritten but retains conceptual freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a readable, genre-blending narrative. Some forced integration (e.g., "cautious abandon"), but the central metaphor of time-weaving through a tailor’s lens showcases ingenuity within constraints.</comment>
