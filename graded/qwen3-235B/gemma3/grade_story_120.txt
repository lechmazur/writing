<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's guilt over sister's accident is clear but underdeveloped; motivation to break loop is consistent but lacks visceral emotional depth; fishing lure as fractured memory symbol is effective but thinly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Time-loop structure creates tension but pacing feels compressed; cyclical reset to recursive trauma has cohesion but resolution lacks concrete cause-effect clarity; beginning/end connection is suggestive but underwhelmingly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel's iridescent fluid and harbor setting create eerie atmosphere; raindrop focus adds sensory specificity; tone balances melancholy with surrealism but could expand on tactile/multi-sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance of trauma acceptance is poignant; symbolism (fishing lure, nest, rain) effective; ending’s hopeful curiosity resonates thematically; lacks stronger subtext on cycles of grief.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichéd loops through quantum abstraction; metaphors (drowning in trauma) are original; some phrasing (“excited boredom”) risks abstraction over authenticity; emotional showing outweighs telling but occasionally slips into poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively around trauma and loops; brief length serves cyclical motif but truncates character arc; tone/style balance evokes literary intent; lingering reflection on acceptance is purposeful but slightly dissatisfying in brevity.</comment>
