<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters lack depth beyond assigned roles; motivations feel underdeveloped and inconsistently applied, with emotional reactions appearing abrupt or contrived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a basic arc but relies on unearned leaps, particularly the sudden reveal of the avalanche as the "true" mission; pacing is uneven in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting relies on cyberpunk clichés (neon rain, slums) with minimal fresh detail; atmosphere is passable but generic, failing to uniquely amplify tension or themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some effective tension and a memorable twist, but dialogue feels flat; the reflective label metaphor is intriguing yet underdeveloped, and emotional impact is dulled by thin character work.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre tropes with minimal subversion; occasional fresh ideas (e.g., the label’s reflection) are undermined by predictable emotional beats and occasionally ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are mostly functional but not innovatively interwoven; the tight word limit restricts deeper exploration of key themes like inevitability, surveillance, or betrayal.</comment>
