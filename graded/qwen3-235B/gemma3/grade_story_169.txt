<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice and motivations (memory curation/forgotten songs) shape Tiber's unconventional methods, but personal stakes and internal conflicts remain underdeveloped despite thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reversed-label method drives tight causality, with Mrs. Gable's arc achieving completeness. Pacing feels constrained but deliberate, though emotional beats could resonate more deeply within the limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Recycling nebula setting and floating platform create vivid, melancholic atmosphere supporting the theme, but sensory details remain underutilized beyond visual strangeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weaving metaphors (houses as verses, persuasion as re-tuning) and subtext about memory’s weight elevate storytelling. Ending’s emergent waltz provides satisfying thematic closure through poetic causality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise avoids tropes, using reversed labels and soul-broking to subvert genre expectations. Stylistic flourishes enhance rather than overshadow thematic clarity, with emotional nuance shown through action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All assigned elements cohere into a unified narrative exploring memory’s persistence. While some descriptors border on ornate abstraction, the story’s conceptual ingenuity and emotional restraint justify its brevity as a thematic strength.</comment>
