<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent but thinly developed; motivations are clear but lack internal complexity. The sea glass effectively symbolizes resilience but doesn't fully illuminate Tiber's psyche. Actions align with motivations, but there's minimal evolution beyond static introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logically driven by decoding microfilm and siphoning radiance, but pacing feels slightly compressed. The circular structure (solitude to acceptance) works within constraints, though key transitions between scientific process and emotional revelation lack depth. Resolution feels conceptually earned but narratively underweighted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through tactile details ("bruised purple nebula," "silently audible hum") and thematically resonant. The floating observatory's isolation and cosmic scale amplify existential themes. However, the orbital station archives and "shady" origins of the microfilm feel cursorily included, detracting from atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (sea glass, microfilm, black hole metaphors) elevates thematic resonance. Emotional impact hinges on abstraction over visceral showing, occasionally leaning on concepts ("gritty acceptance") rather than embodied experience. The ending's flicker of hope feels earned but underdramatized. Craft strengths outweigh occasional overreliance on poetic density.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original in blending quantum theory with emotional alchemy, though some phrasing ("whimsical hope") undermines grit. Avoids most clich√©s but skirts purple prose thresholds with ornate descriptors. Metaphors feel fresh but occasionally self-conscious. Emotional depth is implied through subtext more than nuanced character reactions, with hints of AI-style abstraction in interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through tightly interwoven themes and setting, though character depth and plot granularity suffer under word constraints. The "floating observatory/black hole/sea glass" constellation works innovatively, but the ending feels more like thematic closure than narrative payoff. Leaves intellectual resonance over emotional stickiness.</comment>
