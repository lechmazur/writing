<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Surface-level exploration of Jax's philosophical practicality; telekinetic ability and tree-planting tradition feel appended rather than organically tied to character depth; motivation stated more than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing uneven—transition from setup to climax glosses over interpersonal tension; cause-effect between tapestry's script and irrigation method resolution lacks technical/logical specificity; coherent but underdeveloped arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric dissonance: medieval tapestry feels misplaced in a spaceship; nebula imagery and hum provide limited sensory immersion; whispered secrets conceptually intriguing but underutilized in shaping the setting's mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Central theme of revival via heritage resonates, but emotional beats rely on exposition over embodied experience; the sapling/gambler duality offers symbolic potential only partially realized; ending feels aspirational rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally defaults to functional phrasing ("thriving flame of his power," "encroaching void"); tree tradition and xeno-artifact exchanges show ingenuity but execution leans on genre-conventional despair/redemption arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Element integration competent but not seamless; the story’s brevity reveals undercooked connections (e.g., linguistics-to-agriculture logic); thematic ambition outweighs the capacity of its constrained structure.</comment>
