<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness is well-integrated with her trauma and symbolic stone-grabbing, but motivation for her change feels somewhat underdeveloped despite thematic clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garage-cleanliness-through-lottery-tickets is clever framing, but emotional pivot feels slightly rushed within tight word count; resolution connects back to anomaly effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gravity-defiant twilight atmosphere established through precise sensory details (pulsing anomaly, uneven gravity) but deeper temporal instability implications remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stone-based metaphor system works powerfully, with physical object mirroring emotional state; ending resonates thematically, but emotional beats could benefit from more gradual build.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids genre tropes with non-anthropomorphized anomaly; some rhythmic repetition of "smooth stones" borders on incantatory redundancy without feeling formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Idea of controlled surrender lingers emotionally; all elements combine cohesively though some (lottery ticket message) strain credulity within 347-word constraints.</comment>
