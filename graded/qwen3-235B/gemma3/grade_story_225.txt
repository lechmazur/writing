<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character established through tincture focus vs. treaties, but romantic motivation feels underdeveloped despite actions aligning with 'unjustly fair' trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc spans observation to defiance, but Morse communication development feels rushed within 500 words; causality logical but compressed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration strong (butterfly tracking drives plot), though story occasionally serves elements rather than vice versa; tone remains consistent.</comment>
