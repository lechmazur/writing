<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (freeing sister) and actions align logically, but inner conflict lacks depth beyond surface traits like jaw-clenching. Vance’s role as a catalyst is underexplored, reducing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical cause-effect chain (overheard stories → vote sabotage), resolving the central tension. Pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle but maintains momentum. The circular structure (hope at start/end) strengthens cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting establishes a minimalist lunar atmosphere, with the greenhouse and biodome hinting at contrast between artificial control and organic growth. Few vivid sensory details weaken immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (greenhouse = rebirth) and subtext (silent resistance). Ending resonates thematically, balancing hope with unresolved tension. Emotional beats are shown through actions (e.g., clutching photo) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic AI writing with nuanced political intrigue and unique setting. Some lines (“serene anger”) border on cliché, and character reasoning occasionally oversimplifies. Overall style is purposeful and restrained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively, though lunar setting’s role feels secondary to the park. The tight word limit creates tension but slightly undermines emotional nuance. Concludes with lingering hope, suggesting depth beyond plot.</comment>
