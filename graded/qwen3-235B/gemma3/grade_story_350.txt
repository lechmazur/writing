<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute "irritatingly perfect" inadequately demonstrated through actions; motivation clear but under-explored through nuanced behavior. Puppeteer's craft doesn't substantively influence methodology or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Logical arc from waiting to revelation, but pacing stumbles during abrupt transitions. Method (tears as incisions) drives plot but lacks visceral cause-effect clarity. Concept shapes direction but lacks fully developed momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (Aegean breeze, crumbling altar) establish intimacy-in-decay. Setting/timeframe mismatch: Temple of Apollo's mythological weight isn't meaningfully engaged with stamp/wedding gown elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (symphonies, fabric of perception) clever but inconsistently sustained. Ending's thematic resonance ("puzzles felt") undercut by underdeveloped subtext. Emotional layering present but uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original use of wedding gown/tears concept, but stamp album feels formulaic. Overuse of poetic abstraction ("symphonies of forgotten sorrows") borders on purple prose. Nuanced emotion told rather than shown through puppeteer's personal connection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack symbiotic integration. Stamps/gown drive plot, temple remains passive. Style alternates between lyrical and vague. Lingering impact present but diluted by loose ends.</comment>
