<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character's "uncommonly typical" facade contrasts effectively with his defiant act, motivations remain consistent, and his scholarly obsession justifies technical application of the coil. Subtle reactions to objects (e.g., tear at transmission) imply emotional depth without overstatement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Plot flows linearly from preparation to execution with clear cause-effect (coil activation → temporal contamination). Pacing balances introspection and action within constraints; opening setup directly pays off in the well's transmission. Resolution feels purposeful, not rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully blends sterile time-travel bureaucracy ("capsule hotel") with mythic resonance ("pre-temporal well"). Sensory details like the coil's metallic coolness and shimmering echo tie environment to emotional stakes, enhancing the theme of buried humanity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poignant metaphor of "voice as temporal contamination" elevates the narrative. Subtext about historical erasure and emotional preservation resonates deeply. Ending’s bittersweet catharsis ("lightness" after defiance) demonstrates craft; prose balances lyricism with purposeful restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Refreshing inversion of time-travel tropes (using narrative rather than paradox as contaminant). Avoids purple prose despite poetic themes; emotional depth emerges through actions (e.g., reconstructed laughter) rather than exposition. Nuanced handling of sacrifice and remembrance feels distinctly human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements synergize seamlessly: the scholar’s meticulousness justifies method, hotel setting contextualizes urgency, and the forbidden tale’s emotional core prevents gimmickry. Leaves lingering meditation on memory’s power against institutional control, transcending sci-fi conventions.</comment>
