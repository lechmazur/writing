<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo's motivation for connection beyond digital is clear but underdeveloped; emotional shifts feel surface-level. Tiberio's role lacks depth beyond his superstition. The assigned attributes shape actions but don't fully drive nuanced character behavior. Dialogue minimal, voice remains somewhat distinct but constrained by brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clean arc but feels compressed. The wager initiates the premise, but the progression from observation to climax (shattered vase) lacks gradual tension. Cause/effect between spectral evidence and the owner's decision is logical but under-explained. Pacing is efficient but leaves key stakes underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting as a reimagined Roman villa is evocatively described through sensory details (dust, lemon polish) and echoes, creating a haunting atmosphere. The connection between the "technically organic" sewing box and the villa's history enhances the eerie tone. However, the setting's potential to deepen character motives (e.g., Tiberio's fixation) is only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storytelling effectively ties the central theme (connection in a digital age) to Leo's arc, culminating in a resonant, subdued catharsis. Use of fragmented spectral glimpses as metaphor for historical erasure adds subtext. "Showing" dominates ("shadow stretching too long"), though ending risks slight sentimentality. Conflict (Leo's search vs. digital emptiness) is resolved satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through the unique "technically organic" sewing box concept, which subverts expectations. Some descriptions border on generic ("dust and lemon polish") but are balanced by fresh imagery (e.g., vase crumbling "slow, deliberate" to underscore spectral tragedy). Emotional nuance in Leo's arc feels human, not formulaic, with minimal "telling."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well despite constraints: the villa's history, Leo's digital-era isolation, and the sewing box's warmth intertwine. The brevity feels deliberate but limits thematic payoff. The wager premise introduces tension but isn't fully exploited. Lingering questions about the villa's preservation hint at deeper societal critiques.</comment>
