<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but development relies on exposition; gardener background informs actions but lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but feels rushed in key moments (e.g., Elara’s disappearance); pacing struggles to balance concept and emotional payoff within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere contrasts sterile tech with natural longing effectively, but sensory details rely on clichéd metaphors (lavender, birds); worldbuilding remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ideas about empathy and memory resonate, but emotional impact is dampened by predictable ending; some vivid imagery (purse as "whispered promise") elevates craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with "improbable" premise, but tech explanation ("emotional resonance field") leans on vague sci-fi fantasy; language occasionally veers toward ornate description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but strained by tight word count; themes linger, yet narrative sacrifices depth for poetic closure (e.g., abrupt "become part of the system" reveal).</comment>
