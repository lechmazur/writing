<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Wei's dual nature as an actor-investigator is well-integrated through his "rationally impulsive" trait, which justifies both meticulous deductions and intuitive leaps. The motivation for weaving emotional honesty through illusions is conceptually clear but occasionally intellectualized rather than embodied through his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central action of solving the Jade Concubine's mystery propels the narrative effectively. The transition to revealing the secret garden feels earned, though the emotional impact of her deliberate disappearance could be more nuanced within the word limit. Pacing maintains momentum without sacrificing coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Sunken Palace’s post-oil decay is rendered through vivid sensory details (dust, fractured light, decaying silk) that mirror the world’s depleted state. The "anxious serenity" tone permeates the atmosphere, with sunlight through debris serving as a visual metaphor for fragile hope emerging from ruin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story’s thematic exploration of truth preservation through illusion and quiet rebellion lingers. Effective use of symbolism (bioluminescent orchids, the warm doll’s dress) and lyrical prose elevates the narrative, though emotional resonance occasionally relies on abstract concepts rather than visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions and genre tropes. The twist of the Concubine’s self-directed disappearance subverts expectation, while the integration of artistic performance (acting, storytelling, gardening) into the mystery framework feels inventive. Descriptors remain specific and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively interwoven: the chameleon actor’s role justifies his investigative method, the doll’s dress anchors the mystery, and the setting’s decay contextualizes the characters’ pursuits of meaning. The story’s brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant impression of fragile hope.</comment>
