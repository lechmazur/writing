<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is concept-driven but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear but abstract, with insufficient demonstration of how his "awe" as an astronomer specifically shapes his methods or worldview beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels minimal; the action of cultivating snowflakes drives the narrative, but the abrupt ending with the idol "wavering" lacks resolution or clear progression beyond a single static gesture.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid, original imagery (e.g., "frost-resistant blooms," "crystal shadows") and a haunting atmosphere that aligns with the post-emotional setting, though some details feel overly ornate without deeper functional purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and subtext elevates the story; the tension between hope and fear resonates, though emotional impact is diluted by the protagonist’s detached, conceptual perspective rather than visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in concept (cultivating hope via snowflakes) but occasionally lapses into stylized abstraction; avoids most clichés but retains some overwrought phrases ("shadows of crystal") and underexplored emotional nuance in moral dilemmas.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements; the story’s brevity feels intentional but limits full exploration; combines elements inventively, leaving a lingering philosophical question about emotion’s role in human survival.</comment>
