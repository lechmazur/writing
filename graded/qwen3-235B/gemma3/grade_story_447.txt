<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Agnes’ transformation from chronicling trivialities to shaping communal reflection aligns with her empathy-driven motivation, though Tiber remains underdeveloped despite catalyzing the plot.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bulletins drive the plot cohesively, with each narrative beat mirroring the ear’s deterioration. The compressed arc from fracture to healing feels earned within constraints, though the resolution risks oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (cinnamon, dissolving rice paper) and the "amber prison" kitchen immerse readers in a tangible, melancholic world where time and decay mirror the town’s emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The interplay of metaphor (jam as mending, unraveling ear as fragile hope) and subtext on collective healing elevates the narrative. The ending resonates with thematic closure and emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Refreshingly avoids trope reliance; the "tiny rebellions" through empathy feel original. However, phrases like "quiet defiance" border on cliché, and the optimism occasionally strains believability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly: bulletins, decay, and cooking form a unified metaphor. The constrained length amplifies tension, leaving a lingering meditation on communal healing through small, intentional acts.</comment>
