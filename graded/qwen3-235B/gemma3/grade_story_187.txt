<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually intriguing but minimally developed; motivations are clear but lack depth in emotional nuance or personal stakes beyond archetypal roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear beginning/middle/end, but the compressed arc relies heavily on implication rather than enacted progression, leaving emotional beats underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details build a haunting atmosphere, but the setting feels more symbolic than organically lived-in, occasionally leaning on genre tropes rather than distinct worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolic depth (floorboard as memory, necessary lies) elevates the narrative; the ending resonates thematically, though dialogue is sparse and underlayered compared to the story's lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (nightmare trails, "blandness") avoids clichés, but occasional poetic abstraction and implied subtext risk obscuring visceral human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, with the story’s brevity serving its reflective tone; thematic resonance lingers, though character interiority and tension could have been more dynamically rendered.</comment>
