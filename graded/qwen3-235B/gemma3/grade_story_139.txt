<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack psychological depth beyond stated fears; Theron's methodical approach aligns with his traits but inner conflict remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression but sacrifices tension for exposition; the connection between beginning and end is implied rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory details create atmosphere but inconsistently; the mountains and humming cable evoke mood, but the "visually unappealing" landscape remains conceptually underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "echoes of the soul" hint at thematic depth, but emotional impact is diluted by exposition-heavy storytelling; ending attempts thematic resonance without full payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise (analyzing tooth marks for psychic residue) subverts artifact-retrieval tropes, but self-serious tone and overused phrases like "silent witnesses" drag quality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not fully fused into a cohesive whole; the short form works for setup but sacrifices emotional payoff; lingering ideas lack transformative depth.</comment>
