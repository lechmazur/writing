<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but feels underdeveloped. The shame from grandfather's legacy drives action but isn't sufficiently nuanced. The connection between sleep deprivation and inventor persona lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is generally effective, but the ending feels somewhat rushed. The DNA animation action drives the plot, though some causal links between elements strain credibility within the restricted format.</comment>
