<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Purposeful motivation and compassionate core drive Tiber's actions, but his 'precisely messy' trait lacks deeper integration with problem-solving. Dialogue lacks distinct voice, reducing emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression from discovery to resolution with clear stakes, but submarine-centric climax feels underdeveloped. Pacing tightens effectively but sacrifices some emotional beats for concision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative details like rust and harmonic frequencies immerse readers, but the attic trunk and timeframe elements remain superficially connected to the primary conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of balance and legacy resonate through symbolic gear imagery, though emotional beats occasionally border on didactic. Submarine sequence shows strong craft through sensory-driven tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Offers novelty in mechanic-magic synergy and spy-mage concept but relies on shadow entity tropes. Some generic descriptors ('grimy with rust') dampen distinctiveness despite original core premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Multi-element cohesion is functional, not masterful. Technical schematics and submarine mechanics elevate the narrative but occasionally strain organic integration with mystical elements.</comment>
