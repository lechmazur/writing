<question>1</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Character lacks depth and organic development: Tiber's transformation from cook to truth-seeker isn't earned or convincingly portrayed; motivations feel imposed rather than demonstrated, with little distinct "voice" revealing his mental state beyond exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Abstract concepts replace coherent plot progression: The idea-driven narrative jumps between philosophical assertions without clear cause-and-effect or pacing control; subverting systems lacks tangible stakes or logical escalation within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere hinted but underdeveloped: Dust layers suggest timeworn mystery, but sensory details are sparse and inconsistently maintained; the earthquake facility setting creates conceptual contrast but remains underutilized for thematic amplification.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Unrealized thematic potential: The central conflict about suppressed truth lacks visceral engagement or emotional consequences; philosophical concepts remain abstract rather than being dramatized through character actions or concrete imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Formulaic concepts without distinctive voice: Relies on sci-fi tropes (lone truth-seer, institutional deception) without subversion; abstractions replace specific sensory details; emotional weight primarily stated rather than shown through character behavior.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements present but inconsistently integrated: Promising concepts aren't fully realized within constraints; some components feel checklisted rather than organically essential; ambitious themes lack sufficient dramatization for meaningful literary impact.</comment>
