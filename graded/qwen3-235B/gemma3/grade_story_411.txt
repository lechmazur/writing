<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wealth of paradoxical traits but缺乏 emotional interiority; motivation to acknowledge regret is clear, but character remains more metaphorical than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant circularity between eternal task & specific fragment, but lacks traditional arc; pacing controlled, though "study" feels underutilized as plot driver.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subterranean orchard & star-river create haunting, self-consistent atmosphere; sensory cohesion ties setting tightly to theme of spectral preservation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures; blends mythopoeia with emotional specificity; occasional generic descriptors ("brittle with age") slightly dilute poetic precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Synthesis of elements creates immersive philosophical fable; concise length enhances elegiac tone rather than limiting scope; leaves lingering existential contemplation.</comment>
