<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions but lack deeper emotional nuance; Tiber's distrust and Elara's docility hinted but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels slightly rushed in the council's abrupt intrusion; the action's logic through resonance and jettison remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (woodsmoke, sewing machine) create a strong atmosphere; setting and tone work symbiotically, though the guild hall's thematic significance is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Literary devices (brass candlestick as symbol, resonant archive) add depth; ending subverts expectations while reinforcing theme, though emotional resonance is slightly muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and unique magic system avoid clich√©s; precise sensory language serves the narrative without becoming florid, though some phrases ("nostalgic innovation") border on abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the plot with minimal contrivance; the concise format feels deliberate, with the ending provoking reflection on preservation vs. control of knowledge.</comment>
