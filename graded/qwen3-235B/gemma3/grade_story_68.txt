<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (retrieving erased identity) aligns with moral code, but emotional complexity remains surface-level. Bottle cap symbolism hints deeper, but lacks visceral connection to his inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing leans on decryption-as-metaphor to bridge tight structure, though AI adoption feels rushed. Resolution ties to core concept effectively, but stakes don't fully crystallize within word limit.</comment>
