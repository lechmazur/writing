<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's "underestimated rebel" trait lacks full integration into actions; motivations are consistent but emotional depth remains surface-level. "sadly joyful" informs voice but doesn't shape decisions. Pocket knife use shows practical intelligence but feels more symbolic than functional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action of intensifying signal drives plot forward clearly. Pacing balances exposition and progression within tight word limit. Causal logic between call, preparations, and signal deployment maintains coherence. Resolution feels abrupt but thematically appropriate. Minimal narrative gaps hinder full arc development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunted house atmosphere vividly rendered through precise sensory details (mildew, cotton candy) that reinforce "ephemeral gloom" tone. Setting meaningfully connects to character's motivations (fortress quality) and plot devices (hiding resonators). Szechuan cuisine subplot feels tangential rather than integral to world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "sharpened blades" and atmospheric despair create emotional resonance. Central theme of adaptation as quiet resistance emerges powerfully. Ending's bittersweet tone feels earned. Subtext about systemic change through subtle influence adds depth. Underdeveloped emotional states occasionally slip into telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original reinterpretation of rebellion through adaptability rather than force. Avoids genre clichés with "around the system" approach. Fresher use of haunted park setting through functional decay. Cuisine element verges on cliché but doesn't dominate. No significant formulaic transitions; style shows consistent voice despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements work in symbiotic balance for cohesive narrative despite brevity. Character's core concept drives most choices rather than feeling imposed. Short length enhances tension through concentrated focus. Lingering questions about resonator mechanics suggest deliberate ambiguity rather than incompleteness.</comment>
