<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and grief drives every action; the use of the bell ties into emotional truth, but limited inner conflict shown beyond single-minded purpose</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels slightly padded; the central action of "coaxing" data remains abstract and lacks tangible stakes within constrained length</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory textures (velvet chair, humming machine) deepen atmosphere, though the hall's societal purpose remains underexplored despite symbolic contrasts</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (after-images, silent bell) create resonance; subtext about technology's false promises lingers, though emotional beats occasionally verge on poetic abstraction without human warmth</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through specific details (predictive algorithms as nightmares) and avoids over-explanation; some phrases ("relentless march of time") teeter toward convention</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong unifying theme of memory vs. progress binds elements, but brief length sacrifices secondary character development and contextual worldbuilding that might elevate cohesion</comment>
