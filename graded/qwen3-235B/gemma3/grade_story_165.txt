<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflict isn't fully explored. Tiber's "gentleness" informs his magic but isn't demonstrated through specific behaviors or dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has coherent structure but pacing unevenness in the middle; cause/effect for key moments (reversed messages working, dwarf reactions) feel slightly underdeveloped despite strong arc from discovery to rebellion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere well-established through fungal light and dwarven pragmatism, but sensory details regarding sound/texture of Grimstone lack consistency; setting enhances theme but feels thinly populated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (butterfly as memory/reckoning) and thematic resonance about truth's power, but emotional impact limited by overly expository ending; justice theme declared rather than viscerally embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique reverse-magic mechanics; some purple prose ("joyfully terrifying darkness") and underexplained concepts, but originality in intertwining magic with historical accountability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively but unevenly: butterfly/reverse-method integration is outstanding, but timeframe's brittle branch feels contrived; concept/character motivations are consistent but execution lacks refinement for elite standards.</comment>
