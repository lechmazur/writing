<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (contain grief to offer Wren a better world) are consistent, but joviality contradicts his decades of sorrow; the earring’s emotional weight is clear, but internal conflict lacks nuanced psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight focus on metronome-driven emotional observation creates structural unity; train departure as temporal frame provides emotional arc, but pacing feels slightly compressed for full thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Attic’s ozone/contraption details and metronome’s rhythm effectively evoke mechanistic melancholy; sensory cohesion strong, though fervent indifference tone occasionally undercuts Tiber’s raw vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (grief as metal, metronome as heartbeat) deepen emotional subtext; ending’s “dance with darkness” thematic pivot resonates, though some lyrical passages border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar grief-iconography (earring, train) with minimal subversion; emotional introspection is layered yet occasionally veers into abstract over-specification.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive meditation on emotional control; brevity accentuates thematic focus but slightly limits character dimensionality.</comment>
