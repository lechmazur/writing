<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent, with Tiber's solitude and obsession with confessions shaping his actions. His transformation in the final scene feels earned, though deeper exploration of his painter identity's relevance to the plot could enhance nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates tight coherence within constraints, with the resuscitation action driving the narrative forward logically. Pacing is mostly effective, though Lyra's recovery could benefit from slightly more physiological detail to justify the emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through evocative contrasts (luminous garden vs. sterile medical room). Sensory details are specific and immersive, though the "borrowed books" timeframe concept remains underdeveloped in its connection to character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and subtext elevates the narrative beyond surface-level themes. The ending provides satisfying thematic resolution while maintaining emotional resonance. Subtlety in character psychology through action rather than exposition demonstrates strong craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptualizing vulnerability as life force. Avoids major tropes through unique narrative approach. Some phrasing edges toward ornate territory but maintains purposeful engagement with core ideas rather than empty flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Excellent cohesion demonstrates thoughtful element integration. Brevity works as an intentional stylistic choice rather than constraint. Themes resonate beyond simple plot mechanics, though further textual density could enhance lingering impact.</comment>
