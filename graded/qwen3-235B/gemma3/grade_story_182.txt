<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Main character lacks psychological depth; development exists primarily through exposition rather than organic action or decision-making. Assigned traits motivate plot but feel externally imposed rather than innate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows logical progression from discovery to revelation, but the climactic shift to "co-authoring chaos" feels underprepared. Cause-effect relationships hold, though pacing compresses emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned theater and Magnetic Mountain create a vivid, eerie atmosphere amplified by sensory details (rustling projector sounds, metallic coldness of the spoon). Murals-as-blueprints concept integrates effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses rich metaphors (metal hunger/spoons-as-keys) and conveys theme of chaotic creation, but emotional resonance diluted by abstract prose. Ending conceptual rather than earned through character journey.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains moments of stylized prose that lean toward genre conventions. Metaphors are mostly fresh, though "frolicsome regret" occasionally veers into self-indulgent phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively around the theme despite brevity. The premise feels deliberate rather than constrained, though deeper engagement with "quiet hunger" or "trivially monumental" aspects remains underexplored.</comment>
