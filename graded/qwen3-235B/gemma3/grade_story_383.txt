<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>General Silas's weariness and internal conflict are well-rendered, but his transformation could be more gradual; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Limited by word count, but the cyclical structure (coffee at start/end) and photographic process create cohesion; pacing is steady despite minimal conflict progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Gritty cosmic diner imagery and sensory details (lukewarm coffee, flickering neon) immerse readers, though "between rides" concept could be more thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (seaweed as solace, photos containing fear) are evocative; dialogue is crisp and purposeful. Ending balances resolution with lingering doubt, avoiding saccharine closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh integration of assigned elements avoids formulaicity; "dark matter" as existential glue and arcs as visual therapy feel inventive. Language prioritizes precision over ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on fear and renewal; length feels purposeful. Leaves the reader with a paradoxical sense of lightness amid lingering darkness.</comment>
