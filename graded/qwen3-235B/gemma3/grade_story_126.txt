<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks depth beyond singular obsession. Actions align with traits, but emotional nuance is minimal. Object's significance remains symbolic rather than integral to characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear arc, but pacing feels compressed. Connection between beginning and end is strong, though some transitions lack weight. Method shapes plot effectively but requires narrative shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered with sensory details. Setting effectively contrasts illusion with decay. Timeframe informs mood but atmospheric integration isn't fully realized throughout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story delivers emotional resonance and thematic weight. Uses strong metaphors (poster as illusion) and purposeful ending. Some "telling" diminishes impact, but layered meaning and subtext elevate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic elements but contains occasional overused descriptors. Tone remains consistent. Metaphors like "phantom forests" feel fresh, though character psychology skews simplistically deterministic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively, though some feel peripheral. Brevity serves narrative focus, and story prompts reflection. Not groundbreaking but demonstrates thoughtful integration of assigned components.</comment>
