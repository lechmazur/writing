<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Subtle plot progression with weaving influencing Elara, but lacks concrete resolution. Pacing efficient, though the arc feels incomplete despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lunar colony contrast with loom and ballet shoes creates haunting atmosphere; effective sensory details, but "rustic refinement" concept is underutilized.</comment>
