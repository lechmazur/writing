<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brody’s quiet rebellion is well-established through his celestial obsession, but his emotional connection to his mother’s chain lacks deeper exploration beyond symbolic use. Motivation feels coherent but underexplored in its internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The meteor shower and Dickinson star charts drive the plot effectively, but the transition to Blackwood Creek feels slightly abrupt despite poetic logic. Pacing is tight yet coherent; the ending’s thematic resolution is satisfying but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory blending (climate control hum, phantom limb ache) and atmospheric decay create a haunting mood. The scientific poetry library’s peculiarity enhances the eerie tone, making the setting a palpable character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (poems as encoded starlight) and subtextual themes of memory vs. decay are poignant. The ending’s quiet resolve is emotionally resonant, though some poetic abstraction risks diluting immediate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh integration of science/poetry avoids clichés, but phrases like “ghostly resolve” lean on familiar imagery. Character nuance (rebellion as memory preservation) elevates originality, though some descriptors border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Limited word count hinders deeper character exploration, but elements interlock cohesively. The blending of celestial patterns and personal history achieves thematic depth, leaving a lingering meditative tone.</comment>
