<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations feel stated rather than earned. "Sometimes always" remains vague and unconnected to core traits. Compassion drives plot but isn't substantiated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows clear trajectory but feels rushed. Fleeing action effectively drives narrative, but observatory connection and shadow-tracking method lack logical momentum within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Carnival setting creates atmospheric contrast, but sensory details remain surface-level. Twilight timeframe enhances mood, though observatory key's significance isn't fully integrated into environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Occasional vivid metaphors ("celestial energy") exist, but emotional impact diluted by generic phrasing. Central conflict introduced but resolution feels abrupt; theme of weaponized empathy remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d tropes (abandoned carnival, brass key) without subversion. Overwrought descriptions ("skeletal grin against bruised sky") verge on purple prose; character motivations lack human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story maintains coherence but lacks transformative depth. Assigned elements function narratively yet feel compartmentalized rather than synergistically integrated within brief format.</comment>
