<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits and clear motivation, but emotional depth lacks human nuance; the illusionist's intensity feels surface-level despite evocative actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with the lace-deciphering method, but the tight word limit sacrifices complexity in the transformation arc; resolution feels abrupt yet conceptually coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like ozone and woven mist create immersive atmosphere; the "hush after a cashier" juxtaposition adds eerie stillness, though not deeply integrated into the ethereal setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Strong metaphors (e.g., lace as emotional map) elevate the theme, but explicit exposition about "understory" weakens subtlety; ending lacks urgency despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh combinations (binder clip as tool, lace as emotional guide) avoid clich√©; some phrases ("linguistically precise moments") verge on ornate, but overall voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, though pacing feels slightly rushed; the brief length emphasizes conceptual clarity over emotional payoff, leaving ideas lingering.</comment>
