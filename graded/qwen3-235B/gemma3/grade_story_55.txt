<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While Tiber’s motivation of preserving lost craft is consistent and his silent demeanor is evocatively portrayed, the romantic doom backstory feels underdeveloped, serving more as a vague backstory than a driving force for his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear beginning (setup of purpose), middle (action with the lyre), and end (subtle resolution). The plot arcs crisply within constraints, though the final emotional payoff leans heavily on implied subtext.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously constructed through sensory details (dust motes, tremors) and the contrast between utopian sterility and tactile craftsmanship. The pre-stellar timeframe’s thematic synergy elevates the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (keys, lyre/resonance) and subtext (loss as artistic fuel). Ending is poignant but risks vagueness—emotional closure depends on reader inference rather than concrete revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with fresh metaphors (e.g., “petrified starlight wood”), but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing (“crystalline chime,” “expectant darkness”) that feels strained rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively linked to theme, though some (utopia design studio) feel underexplored. The tightness of the premise allows for thematic depth but sacrifices broader worldbuilding.</comment>
