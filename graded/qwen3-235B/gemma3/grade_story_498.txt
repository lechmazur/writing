<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent (Tiber's desire for connection vs. enclave's xenophobia), but psychological depth feels slightly underdeveloped despite symbolic actions. The seed pods and communal garden effectively externalize internal conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints; cause-effect logic holds despite brevity. The detour drives the plot, and the ending circles back effectively. Some narrative compression strains pacing, particularly in guards' transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral world-building through specific sensory details (brittle pods, phosphorescent fungi). The xenophobic enclave and midwinter hush create oppressive atmosphere that mirrors thematic tensions. Connections between objects/settings and themes are masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (seed pods vs. gardens) and subtext about connection. Ending resonates as earned rather than overly sentimental. Writing style balances lyricism with narrative momentum without veering into pretension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through specificity of details (e.g. "tyranny of indifference"). The "unlikely probable" concept is subtly integrated. Some phrases ("morbid still life") border on ornate but remain purposeful within context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements feel purposefully integrated to support thematic coherence. The brevity amplifies emotional impact rather than limiting it. Leaves lingering questions about gradual change that resonate beyond the page.</comment>
