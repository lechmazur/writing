<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits like xenophobia and obsession with secrets are clear, but motivations remain surface-level. Emotional depth sparse despite atmospheric context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but lacks resolution. Passage discovery feels abrupt; word constraint strains arc cohesion despite tight imagery-action linkage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually rich with hydroponic specificity (noodle strands as "golden rain," metal supports) and evocative humidity contrasts with sterile worker efficiency, enhancing mystery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery ("green expanse," "pulse in chest") and metaphorical symbolism engage, but relies on portentous phrasing ("agonizing bliss") without fully earned thematic transcendence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (chess grandmaster/xenophobia hybrid) but stumbles into ornate descriptors ("delightfully dull," "confetti") that border on purple prose despite fresh setting fusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack transformative synergy. Atmospheric momentum compensates for predictable mystery-quest structure; lingering intrigue overunderdeveloped themes.</comment>
