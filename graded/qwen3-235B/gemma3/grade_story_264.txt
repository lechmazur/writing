<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strengths: Tiber's eccentric alchemy and Elara's skepticism are clearly rooted in their assigned traits. Tiber's cheerful persistence and Elara's guarded wonder align with motivations. Their use of the cracked lens method feels character-specific. Weakness: The timeframe element's influence on character behavior isn't fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strengths: The action (projection demonstration) cleanly structures the plot. Concept (touched sky) directly shapes progression. Pacing works within word constraints, with cause-effect between Tiber's technical adjustments and Elara's gradual emotional shift. Weakness: Slightly abrupt resolution—Elara's transformation could benefit from one more beat.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strengths: The derelict tracking station's "dust" and "hum" create tactile atmosphere. Timeframe (between innings) contrasts cosmic with mundane. The radio's crackling sound enhances setting. All sensory details support tone of fragile hope. Weakness: Minimal olfactory/tactile elements prevent a perfect score.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Cracked lens symbolizes flawed beauty. Ending resonates through showing, not telling, with "light danced on the wall." Subtext about enduring wonder vs. cynicism emerges naturally. Dialogue and descriptions avoid cliché. Weakness: Could deepen psychological subtext beyond surface theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Avoids genre tropes—alchemy serves philosophical purpose. The "touched sky" is fresh concept. Emotional progression feels earned through technical gestures (lens adjustments). Weakness: Minimal purple prose near ending ("a quiet song of forgotten stars").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve story: Alchemy drives action, cracked lens deepens themes. Timeframe enhances tension between cosmic and everyday. Writing style maintains focus. Leaves lingering question about memory's persistence. Weakness: Slight over-description in projector "humming to life" sequence.</comment>
