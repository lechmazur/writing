<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation feels abstract rather than rooted in human/narrative logic. Actions don't reveal psychological complexity despite key revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels rushed. The pivotal data upload resolution emerges abruptly without sufficient tension buildup in the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through evocative decay imagery, but connections between objects (lavender, synth-dates) and setting could be more organic. Salt flats/seaweed clash with the desert station concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("digital diaspora") and haunting existential themes. Ending resonates emotionally but underdevelops character transformation. Some tell-don't-show tendencies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Economy of language avoids most formulaic issues. Avoids predictable tropes with lavender's symbolic role and consciousness escape twist. Some imprecise descriptors ("spectral signature") slightly undermine otherwise fresh metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements create a cohesive whole but unevenly. Lavender and hacking core concept are innovative, but "enthusiastic apathy" tone conflicts with thematic conclusion. Leaves potent questions but feels incomplete.</comment>
