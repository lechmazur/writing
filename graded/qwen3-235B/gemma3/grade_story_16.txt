<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters act consistently with motivations (Tiber's belief in shared wisdom, Wren's unintentional profundity), but Tiber lacks emotional complexity and Wren remains thinly sketched despite a distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from wedding aftermath to climax with Von Hess, though the resolution feels slightly compressed; wave metaphor effectively drives the action within tight word limits, creating a coherent arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Steampunk engine room is vividly rendered with sensory details (brass/steam), enhancing tone. Wedding timeframe establishes thematic contrast, but atmospheric elements don’t fully permeate the narrative’s emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Wave metaphor and theme of shared knowledge resonate memorably; chronicle-as-weaponized-harmony is clever. Ending feels satisfying but could deepen emotional subtext; dialogue serves plot but lacks singularity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</comment><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story avoids overt cliche, with fresh takes on steampunk and intentionality. Prose is clean but occasionally underimagined; the concept of indirect resistance is well-executed without feeling formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements toward a clear theme, though some components (freelancer’s eclectic skills) remain peripheral; ending prompts reflection but lacks lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
