<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's woodsman trait informs isolation but doesn't deeply shape his actions; motivation to map railways reveals avoidance but lacks full emotional nuance; hairbrush connection shows depth but transitions to honesty feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Short-circuit drives pivotal realization effectively; plot arc spans avoidance to acceptance but rushes resolution; cause-effect from equipment failure to emotional clarity is logical; pacing manages tension within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Radio Wave Garden evokes lost connections metaphorically; sensory details like "humming wires" and "grime on his cheek" add texture, but atmosphere leans more on symbolism than immersive environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (railways as grief, echo mapping as avoidance) deepen theme; ending’s "truth long overdue" resonates emotionally; subtext about isolation vs. connection is layered but occasionally stated overtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original concept blends grief with tech-metaphor without cliché; avoids purple prose; emotional beats (tear, hairbrush warmth) feel authentic through context, not exposition; style maintains consistent introspective tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements form cohesive narrative spine; some (e.g., timeframe) integrate better than others (water tower’s role feels contrived); theme of honesty emerges organically despite structural constraints.</comment>
