<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While Tiber's internal conflict and growth are clearly portrayed through his actions with the ruler and analysis of fingerprints, the narrative occasionally relies on abstract emotional descriptions rather than fully embodied character choices, slightly diluting his individual voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite the strict word limit, the plot maintains a clear arc from suppressed longing to harmonious resolution. The fingerprint analysis method drives the narrative effectively, though the Queen's subtle pheromonal shift feels slightly underexplained within the tightly controlled pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like "swirling pollen patterns" and tactile descriptions of the cracked ruler create strong immersion. The juxtaposition of mechanical hive architecture with organic emotional shifts enhances thematic tension, though some atmospheric elements could be deeper in the final act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (fingerprints as desire echoes, ruler as lost/found purpose) creates layered meaning. The ending achieves emotional resonance through quiet transformation rather than dramatic resolution, maintaining thematic consistency while avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of insectile biology and human emotional concepts avoids genre clich√©s. Prose maintains precise clarity while incorporating inventive metaphors, though rare instances of phrasing ("jubilant remorse") verge on conceptual overreach without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>All assigned elements cohere naturally into the narrative framework. The story transcends its constraints through thematic depth and symbolic resonance, though a few element connections (particularly timeframe treatment) could be more explicitly integrated.</comment>
