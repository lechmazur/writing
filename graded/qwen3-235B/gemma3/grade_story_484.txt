<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict and underdeveloped backstory; motivation exists but lacks human complexity or evolving stakes. The "grogginess" isn't meaningfully tied to his actions under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inciting incident through discoloration is original but underexplained. Coherent arc compressed effectively, though the ending resolution feels abrupt and convenient rather than earned through narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Effective sensory details (cold, color shifts) create mood, but setting lacks specificity beyond generic "haunted house" tropes. Protest's presence is atmospheric but not thematically integrated with the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor effectively (darkness as forgotten kindness) but relies on familiar ghost-story structures. Ending avoids cliché yet fails to deliver deeper thematic resonance through Tiber's brewing resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in conceptualizing darkness but contains overwrought language ("deliberate snuffing out of light and memory"). Character motivation feels intellectually constructed rather than emotionally inhabited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</comment>Story coheres but elements operate parallel rather than interlocked - protest's presence and Tiber's "flippant solemnity" lack narrative payoff. Thematic implications of memory/kindness are introduced but not dramatically explored.</grade>
