<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistent but lack deeper emotional nuance; Tiber's quirks enhance her persona but don't fully explore internal conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and tightly constructed, with cause-effect clarity, though the word limit slightly compresses the climax's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly immersive, with sensory details like ozone and peaches strengthening the setting's mystical decay and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (canyon as memory) and layered themes (liberation vs. control) elevate the story, though some subtext remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes; fresh concepts (grace harvesting, pickled peaches as leverage) balance originality with subtle AI-writing tendencies in minor descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Solid cohesion; elements serve the narrative, ending with lingering mythic resonance. Slight awkwardness in integrating "perfectly flawed" fully.</comment>
