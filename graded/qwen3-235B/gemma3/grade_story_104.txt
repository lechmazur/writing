<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The character's stoicism is effectively shown through precise actions, but deeper psychological exploration beyond surface motivations is lacking. The cameo as a catalyst for rebellion is conceptually sound but could use more visceral reaction to strengthen the connection between object and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence within constraints, but the encrypted shipping labels feel arbitrary. Pacing manages to convey transformation through small acts despite word limits, though climactic moments lack developed cause-and-effect progression within the miniature world's logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric creation in miniature worlds with tactile velvet ropes, fractured light, and precise diorama details. The juxtaposition of stifling perfection against subtle alterations creates haunting tension through sensory immersion that directly supports narrative themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic use of broken cages and tilted statues effectively conveys subtext. The steward's restrained rebellion shows careful construction through quiet details, though emotional resonance occasionally borders on being too conceptually abstract to fully land in concrete emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original use of miniature museum setting elevates the narrative beyond clich√©s. Some lyrical passages risk ornateness but generally maintain purposefulness. The encoded labels and 'honestly rare' elements threaten to become contrived mechanics rather than organically integrated components.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Overall cohesion is impressive given multiple required elements working synergistically. Timeframe feels somewhat incidental rather than essential, but the miniature world logic anchors the narrative. Ending leaves satisfying thematic resonance about small-scale defiance.</comment>
