<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some inconsistency in motivation; Tiber's transition from locksmith to preserver feels underdeveloped despite reasonable alignment between his skills and role. Minimal character arc within constraints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Basic plot coherence but feels incomplete; the pottery class meeting initiates action but resolution is abrupt. Logical cause-effect, but pacing lacks balance due to compressed format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Evocative details (apples/clay) excel, but setting integration shallow. Atmospheric potential of orchard/timeframe remains underexploited; tone complements theme but lacks depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (throne as stewardship) and poetic prose elevate impact, but emotional resonance remains muted. Subtext enriches plot yet resolution feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unique combinations (pottery class/hunting legacy) show creativity, but some phrases ("delightfully menacing") read formulaic. Tension between tradition/modernity lacks organic nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Ambitious element integration works mechanically but not seamlessly. Story raises questions but resolution insufficient for full satisfaction; ideas linger more than emotional impact.</comment>
