<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's attributes (relaxed pathfinder, wisely foolish) are consistently embodied through actions (gentle flute-playing, non-judgmental ghost perception). Motivation to "naturalize" spirits by amplifying emotions aligns with methods (music, lens). However, depth could improve - Tiber occasionally feels archetypal rather than fully realized as an individual with vulnerabilities or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Linear descent/progression through cellar creates tight cause-effect chain. Musical method drives plot toward piano revelation. Opening winter description and closing spring parallelism provide satisfying arc. Some compression strains (room discovery feels sudden), but economy enhances momentum rather than hindering it. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere meticulously constructed through specific sensory details (ivy-beard, woolen coat warmth contrasting with cellar dampness). Winter framing metaphorically amplifies ghostly coldness made warm. Setting isn't "used" but becomes character itself - oppressive yet transformative. Perfect synergy between environmental mood and theme of buried expression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors ("mosaic realities," "fractured energies") avoid clich√© through precise implementation. Subtext equating emotional repression with haunting resonates universally. Ending's "harmonized" cellar demonstrates theme rather than stating it. Quiet dissolution of ghost provides emotionally resonant closure without sentimentality. Entire story functions as extended metaphor executed with narrative discipline.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Replaces typical haunting tropes (terror/suffering) with novel concept of "misplaced echoes." Flows organically rather than formulaically - music-as-communication and lens-as-emotional-mirror both feel unique yet inevitable. Some lyrical excess ("mosaic realities layered within the mundane") risks pretentiousness but stays purposeful. Avoids mechanical repetition despite poetic style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements interdependent rather than checklist-based - the magnifying lens enables emotional revelation, winter framing defines temporal transformation, musical method creates narrative spine. Brief length leverages poetic economy effectively. Lingering philosophical questions about expression and remembrance suggest depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
