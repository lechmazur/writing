<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's aloofness is consistently shown through restrained physicality and isolation, but lacks deeper internal conflict. Her motivation to navigate grief through mapping aligns with her method, yet emotional depth feels implied rather than fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Non-linear progression works within tight constraints, with dance-as-mapping creating a clear emotional arc. Ending resolves through transformation rather than event, though some pacing lulls occur between symbolic images.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, hyper-sensory atmosphere where setting reflects inner states with precision—each installation element mirrors emotional geography. Timeframe's melancholy and art's distortion create tangible weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful use of spatial metaphor and embodied storytelling. The central theme of grief-as-mapping transcends surface plot through layered symbolism. Ending avoids closure while feeling emotionally purposeful.</comment>
