<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains underdeveloped despite intriguing attributes; "assertively meek" is stated but not dramatized through consistent action. Motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally unearned due to insufficient interiority or contrasting interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Non-linear structure sacrifices causal clarity; the firework timing device feels arbitrary rather than structurally integral. Resolution is thematically satisfying but lacks concrete narrative consequences within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines vivid digital decay imagery with underexploited analog elements. Sensory details (smoke, chipped ceramic) ground the setting, but the Mirage Oasis concept remains broadly sketched rather than distinctly specific.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of tapestry-as-technology juxtaposition creates memorable metaphor, but emotional stakes remain abstract. Ending's poetic resonance compensates somewhat for uneven showing-vs-telling throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but exhibits occasional vague descriptors ("lingering scent of smoke and possibility") and slightly formulaic analog-vs-digital dichotomy. Gold-thread mechanism shows pockets of genuine ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not structurally; some elements (firework timing, tapestry method) feel conceptually borrowed rather than organically integrated. Tone successfully sustained but at expense of narrative specificity.</comment>
