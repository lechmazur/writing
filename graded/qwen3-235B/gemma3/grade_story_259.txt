<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters serve thematic purposes but lack emotional depth. Tiber's cryptic nature feels like a narrative shortcut, while Thorne's obsession is compelling yet underexplored beyond plot function. Motivations align with actions but remain surface-level without psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear philosophical arc but struggles with pacing. The revelation feels rushed in the tight word count, and the factory's role as a catalyst isn't fully leveraged. The beginning-to-end connection is conceptually strong but narratively compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of the "metallic landscape" and cosmic revelations creates intriguing tension, but sensory details are uneven. The hum of machinery and swirling nebulae are vivid, while tactile/olfactory elements remain absent, weakening full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emerges as a metaphysical fable about perception and legacy. The telescope-as-revelation-tool is strikingly symbolic, and the ending achieves thematic resonance. Subtext about "remembering vs. creating" lingers, though emotional weight is undercut by character shallowness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally relies on familiar mystical-artifact tropes. The twist about "mapping creation" is clever, and language balances precision with lyricism. However, some phrases like "comforting unease" risk feel overwritten, and character psychology leans on archetypes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Successfully unifies elements into a cohesive philosophical narrative. The brevity amplifies thematic focus but strains character/setting development. The central metaphor of perception-as-legacy resonates strongly, leaving an intellectual rather than emotional imprint.</comment>
