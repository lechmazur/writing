<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's introversion and weariness are established but remain surface-level; motivation for seeking courage resurfaces via external object rather than internal complexity. Reactions to the CD lack layered psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arcs from meandering emptiness to symbolic awakening, but pacing feels compressed; the CD's discovery accelerates emotional shift too abruptly, undermining gradual thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, atmospheric decay: neon's phantom pulse, fog's weight, fireflies as living text. Sensory cohesion grounds abstract themes in a tangible, haunting world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original metaphors (fireflies as "legible script," neon as extinct desire) elevate; avoids clichéd endings, but occasional ornate phrasing risks distracting (e.g., "crooked hope"). Emotional resonance leans slightly on stated realizations over fully embodied subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively—fireflies guide, CD catalyzes, setting reflects entropy—but story's brevity leaves thematic veins under-explored. Lingering reflection on "attempting to bloom" lingers conceptually, if not viscerally.</comment>
