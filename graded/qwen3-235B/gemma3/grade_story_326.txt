<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but depth beyond desperation and defiance remains underexplored; "sweetly fierce" lacks full integration into actions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc is clear but pacing uneven; crucial moments (park’s dissolution/reformation) feel superficially treated. Cause-effect logic holds, but tighter execution needed in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes melancholy and hope but lacks sustained sensory immersion; "Hush" and Lumina’s liminality hint at depth not fully realized within the brief scope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fan/fire) and theme of defiance resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract telling. Ending avoids pat resolution but lacks lingering psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original blend of magical and sci-fi elements, but garbled transmissions and some ornate descriptions risk tonal dissonance. Character emotions often stated rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Ambition evident in element fusion, but structural compression undermines organic cohesion. Conceptual richness outweighs underdeveloped passages; thematic resonance partially achieved.</comment>
