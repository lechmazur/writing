<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (seeking magic) but inner conflict lacks nuance. Shift from missionary to seeker feels underdeveloped. Fork and piano tie to actions but voice remains generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc (arrival-mission-failure-conversion) but pacing uneven. Plot driven by piano decoding but rushed integration of butterfly migration's thematic role. Logical cause/effect in abandonment of faith.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (glass taste, piano's "warped sound") create immersive desert. Butterfly migration adds temporal urgency. Connection between setting acoustics and magic system clever but underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo-as-magic metaphor and butterflies-as-transience symbolism work. Ending evokes thematic shift from belief to understanding. Relies too heavily on explicit motivation statements rather than behavioral manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids conversion tropes but contains overly ornate descriptors ("blinding glare," "echoing silence"). Piano magic system feels original but execution follows "lone seeker finds truth" template. Subtly distinctive but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion despite tight constraints. Elements service theme but lack interlocking complexity. Concise yet leaves emotional subtext underdeveloped. Publishable but not groundbreaking.</comment>
