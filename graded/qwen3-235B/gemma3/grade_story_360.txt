<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's meekness and sincerity are clear but lack nuanced development; his passive exploration weakens the connection between traits and dynamic action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear beginning and end with thematic resolution, but the tightly compressed arc feels rushed, relying on exposition over sustained tension or transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Evocative details like phosphorescent fungi create mood, but the setting’s uniqueness isn’t fully leveraged to deepen thematic resonance or character context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (broken pen, dewdrop) and reflective subtext, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract, occasionally didactic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subverts necromancer tropes and uses original metaphors, but some phrasing (e.g., "tangled tapestry") borders on cliché; tone remains consistent despite minor ornate passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Elements cohere thematically, but the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate; the story’s contemplative conclusion leaves resonance but lacks lingering, transformative impact.</grade>
