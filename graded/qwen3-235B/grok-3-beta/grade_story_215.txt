<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strengths in linking traits to actions and motivation, but some psychological nuance lacks depth. Coy aggression feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Puzzles progress logically, but pacing feels rushed; connections between puzzles and Elias’ past remain underexplored despite arc completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting’s sterile sci-fi and dance elements create intriguing contrasts, but sensory details feel generic (e.g., “cold steel,” “flickering monitors”).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (waltz as synthesis) and clear theme of duality; ending resonates, though emotional depth is slightly muted by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (tense psychic-scientific tension), but occasional phrases (“rattled spirit,” “forbidden knowledge”) verge on overused. Emotional resonance leans slightly on telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements feel cohesive but not indispensable—postcard conceit and puzzles could be reimagined without shattering the narrative arc.</comment>
