<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's cartographer background informs her perspective but not actual mapmaking skills; motivations are clear but lack nuanced development, actions only loosely tied to distantly intimate trait</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Forging as central action lacks logical connection to hospital setting; abrupt transition to forge; plot feels incomplete, resolution too sudden without dramatic payoff</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric descriptions succeed but setting coherence fails - sterile hospital and industrial forge clash tonally; sensory details inconsistently applied</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on poetic abstractions ("maps imprisoning", "edgy nostalgia") borders on purple prose; repetitive "futuristic sterile vs primal forge" dichotomy feels artificial; emotional beats stated rather than shown</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; hospital setting and forge forge connection weak; themes hinted at rather than explored; concise but lacks narrative urgency</comment>
