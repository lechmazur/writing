<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks internal depth; motivations (sculpting tomorrow, endurance) are stated more than demonstrated through nuanced actions. The "restless tailor" trait informs his work focus but falls short of shaping a psychologically complex figure. "Earnestly deceptive" aspect remains superficial without revealing contradictions in his behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; cause-effect between lantern discovery and blueprint action is implied but underdeveloped. The beginning-middle-end arc is recognizable within constraints, but pivotal moments lack emotional weight due to pacing limitations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Martian biodome atmosphere is vivid but inconsistent; crimson dust and sterile monotony contrast effectively, but sensory immersion falters (e.g., "reverberating hum" lacks tangible connection to setting). Bookshop mysteries as timeframe element feels decorative rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Craft elevates through resonant metaphors (stitching as creation, lantern as hope) and layered themes of silent rebellion. Ends powerfully by linking personal endurance to collective futurity, though some imagery borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("fragments of yesterday"). Character psychology feels human despite mechanical undertones; tension between survival and ambition offers genuine insight without formulaic resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion is partial: elements like the lantern’s symbolism and dome-as-metaphor work well, but integration of "ephemeral cameo appearances" and "bookshop mysteries" feels contrived rather than synergistic.</comment>
