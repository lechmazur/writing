<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (boredom seeking purpose) aligns with actions, but inner conflict lacks depth; "intelligently foolish" trait surfaces only superficially in smirk and risky plan.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal chain (figurine discovery → taxi alliance → rebellion plot) is logical, but compressed arc feels episodic; storm/taxi sequence propels plot but pacing skimps on rising tension before oath.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves’ sonic texture and crystalline imagery create haunting atmosphere; rainstorm-as-war-drum metaphor superbly merges tone with rebellion motif, though post-imperial decay underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (figurine as "chipped revolution") resonates; ending ties to opening’s motif effectively, but subtext about power’s fragmentation lacks emotional grit. Dialogue flatly functional despite mythic diction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through inventive combinations (taxi cab rebellion crucible, harmonic caves as celestial amplifiers); some phrases ("whispers into roars") border on abstract vagueness, but voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain at narrative seams – rebellion’s cosmic scope overwhelms word count, yet the core alchemy of mundane decay (taxi, figurine) and mythic ambition intrigues.</comment>
