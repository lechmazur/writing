<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's telepathic nature shapes her actions but her internal conflict lacks depth; the hair tie's significance is hinted at but not fully integrated into her motivations or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (quest for truth → glimmer of hope) but pacing feels rushed in the middle; cause-effect ties are logical but underdeveloped due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Steampunk setting immerses through vivid sensory details (soot, brass, steam), but some descriptions verge on overused tropes; atmosphere strongly supports theme of industrial alienation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (calligraphy as truth-seeking, hair tie as memory) are poignant but occasionally undercut by exposition; ending's symbolic hope lacks emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality diluted by steampunk clichés and overly ornate phrasing ("phantom strokes across cobblestones"); emotional subtext feels deliberately crafted but occasionally mechanical in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some (like calligraphy method) feel forced; economy of form suggests brevity is intentional, though the narrative doesn't fully transcend its structural scaffolding.</comment>
