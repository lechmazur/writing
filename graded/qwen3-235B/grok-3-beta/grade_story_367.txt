<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth and internal conflict progression; the protagonist exists more as an emblem of apathy than a fully realized person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative follows a static contemplative rhythm that suits thematic goals but feels incomplete as a story due to absence of pivotal change; pacing maintains momentum through poetic details rather than plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>All elements demonstrably serve thematic unity but varying degrees of implementation quality; brevity works as intentional mood piece rather than narrative limitation.</comment>
