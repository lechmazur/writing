<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rationale implied but lacks depth in character's internal conflict or evolution. Motivation is clear but actions are static, defined more by description than dynamic response to key.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric but lacks narrative momentum. No clear arc; loops within a single moment without resolution. Concept shapes mood more than plot, with pacing uneven in its intense focus on static imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich liminality of the setting amplifies theme and tone. Atmosphere is immersive, with the whisper collection point functioning as a character-like force that meaningfully contextualizes the protagonist's obsession.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., "whispers as seeds") contrast with occasional overwrought phrasing. The central idea—that grief can be reframed as reconciliation—is potent, but emotional resonance is undercut by excessive exposition of themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by stylized repetition of phrases like "noble chaos." Some clichéd phrasing ("weight of every soul") contrasts with fresh concepts like crosswords as conduits for spectral dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a hauntingly singular mood, but minimal narrative progression suggests the brevity was a constraint. Lingering questions about the protagonist's reality vs. delusion hint at thematic depth without full execution.</comment>
