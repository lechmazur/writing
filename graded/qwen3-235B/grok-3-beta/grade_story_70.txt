<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and tied to transformation, but internal conflict and arc lack sufficient depth for top-tier standards despite some effective symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot has cohesion and a compressed arc but feels rushed - key emotional turning points are underdeveloped within the word limit, weakening cause-effect logic between adhesive analysis and transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through rich sensory details and symbolic setting, though gravestone hill risks gothic clich√©; the decay motif effectively mirrors character interiority and enhances conceptual themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong literary devices and thematic resonance (transformation through empathy) elevate the story, but some told emotions and overused metaphors prevent maximum impact; the bellow moment shows strong dramatic focus.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality in combining Tesla with witchcraft works well, but occasionally descends into self-conscious lyricism rather than organic prose; some character logic feels forced and purple prose mars otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive worldbuilding and conceptual ambition are strong, but emotional stakes unevenly developed; the brief length allows atmospheric compression rather than feeling constrained, though thematic resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
