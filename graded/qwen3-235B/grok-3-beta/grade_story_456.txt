<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations (understanding cosmic cycles) align with actions, but internal conflict remains abstract. "Neutrally passionate" and "boldly timid" traits inform her demeanor but lack visceral emotional grounding, weakening full investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows from meditation to revelation, but lacks tension or transformation. The beginning/end connection is thematic rather than structural; pacing lingers on atmosphere at expense of narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Surreal void setting and ghostly garden amplify the metaphysical themes. Sensory details like "jagged edges glowing" and "flowers bloomed only under dimmest light" craft haunting, immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (cosmic cycles as flowers/candle) and symbolic objects. Ending conveys thematic resolution but lacks emotional punch. Subtext about impermanence enriches narrative depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing ("lantern’s last spark died, the plain white candle flickered in defiance"). Fresh metaphors contrast with generic descriptors like "tempered beliefs" that feel vaguely defined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive yet slight; elements serve theme but lack narrative urgency. The brief length accentuates lyrical strengths while exposing underdeveloped emotional stakes. Lingers conceptually but not emotionally.</comment>
