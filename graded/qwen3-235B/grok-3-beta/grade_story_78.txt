<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters exist but emotional depth is overly generalized; Elias and Mara's grief feels like abstract concept rather than embodied experience, motivations remain more implied than demonstrated through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows trajectory but key transitions feel abbreviated; the "coerced" alliance lacks tension, rift confrontation setup lacks earned momentum, compressed format highlights structural shortcuts that undermine narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic imagery is vivid and consistent, but connection between setting details and emotional states remains surface-level; sensory elements create atmosphere without deepening thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attempts metaphorical depth but relies too heavily on abstract vocabulary; cosmic balance theme lacks tangible manifestation; ending's inspirational tone feels unearned rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on archetypal phrasing ("drowned era," "fractured cosmos") undermines originality; metaphors lack specificity; emotional register feels prescribed rather than organically developed through character behavior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Basic cohesion achieved, but thematic elements aren't fully integrated; concept-heavy approach often prioritizes abstraction over human-scale drama; memorable visuals don't compensate for underdeveloped emotional architecture.</comment>
