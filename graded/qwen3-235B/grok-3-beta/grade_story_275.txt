<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thalen’s motivation is clear and consistent, but his internal complexity remains underdeveloped beyond symbolic resilience; his actions align with his goal but lack nuanced emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a linear arc, but the word limit compresses pivotal moments (e.g., sprout emergence), slightly diluting emotional payoff; coherence maintained through tight focus on thematic action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative, cohesive atmosphere with vivid sensory details (ashen soil, comet’s glow) that amplify thematic resonance; setting feels alive and integral to the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (album as hope, weathervane as guidance) and subtextual themes (defiance vs. decay); ending satisfies but could deepen the lingering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains occasionally overwrought metaphors (“wilderness of spirit”) and slight tonal unevenness; originality shines in method (weathervane angle) but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements cohesively, though some (e.g., weathervane) feel conceptually strained; brevity enhances focus but slightly limits depth; leaves thematic questions, if not lingering emotional impact.</comment>
