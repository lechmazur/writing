<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters have distinct traits but lack deeper exploration; motivations are clear but relationships evolve superficially without emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in spots, but the circular structure (beginning/end on observation deck) works within the constraint. Minor narrative leaps undermine coherence slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid steampunk imagery and bioluminescent details, though some descriptors border on excessive without deepening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterflies, Morse code as intimacy) create layered meaning. Emotional impact is poignant but surface-level; style enhances rather than distracts from core themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original use of steampunk/underwater elements clashes with clich√©d phrasing ("unjustly fair") and overly ornate prose that occasionally feels mechanically assembled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are cleverly interconnected, but the story leans too heavily on aesthetic choices over narrative depth; brief length feels restrictive rather than intentional.</comment>
