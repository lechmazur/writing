<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Detailed personality traits exist but emotional depth is overly explicit. Motivation drives actions yet sardonic tone sometimes overshadows genuine grief. Use of orchardist skills in pattern recognition is plausible but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from observation to resolution within constraints. Pacing uneven - revelation sequence compressed. Logical inconsistencies in decoding method challenge believability despite creative premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between sterile facility and organic symbols (peacock/orchard) create compelling metaphors. Sensory details present but unevenly distributed. Atmosphere occasionally overburdened by symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Intriguing metaphorical framework (planes as thwarted truths) and layered patterns create intellectual engagement. Subtext about nature vs. industrialism exists but feels underexplored. Emotional resonance diluted by excessive irony.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Creative integration of peacock cipher avoids complete predictability. Some purple prose (e.g., "shadowy forces") and overly convenient connections present. Character reasoning occasionally linear despite complex plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion around observation and concealed systems. Tight word economy hinders full character realization. Surprising metaphoric synthesis elevates genre constraints though execution remains imperfect.</comment>
