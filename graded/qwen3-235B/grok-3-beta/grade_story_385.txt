<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but overtly stated rather than demonstrated through action; Evelyn’s manipulation feels calculated but lacks psychological depth or moral complexity in her meddler persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven—excessive atmospheric detail bogs down the plot’s progression; the connection between Evelyn’s manipulation of Harrow and the decoded symbols is implied but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., "obsidian skyscraper," "hum of machines") create a haunting atmosphere, but the setting occasionally veers into overwrought clichés rather than organically enhancing the narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "sandcastles against the dawn") and subtext about memory/ancestry are evocative, but emotional resonance is weakened by excessive lyricism; the ending feels thematically conclusive but emotionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overuse of abstract, flowery phrasing ("lucid confusion," "scattered seeds of wisdom") and predictable binaries (light/darkness, past/present) suggest formulaic tendencies; character psychology lacks nuance beyond assigned traits.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are superficially cohesive but strain under scrutiny; the brevity highlights narrative gaps rather than enhancing depth, leaving some choices (e.g., the skates’ symbolism) feeling contrived.</comment>
