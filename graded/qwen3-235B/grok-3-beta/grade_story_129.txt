<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (breaking curses) is clear and influences actions, but lacks depth in emotional nuance; the "steadily unpredictable" trait is underdeveloped and doesn't organically shape decisions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks a strong cause-effect chain; relies on atmospheric progression rather than driven action. The method (embroidered stanzas) is symbolic but under-explored, weakening narrative momentum. Ending feels abrupt despite thematic hints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rocket launch site is vividly rendered, enhancing themes of decay and rebirth. Atmosphere aligns with "hushed euphoria," blending hope and desolation. Sensory details (rust, wind, fading light) immerse the reader, though connections to familial curses feel implied rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "ring absorbing wounds" and "stanza-torpedoes" offer thematic depth, but occasionally lapse into abstraction. The ending's hopeful note resonates, though emotional impact is muted by underdeveloped character interiority. Theme of empathy as liberation is consistent but lightly sketched.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unique elements (embroidered tablecloths, rocket site) avoid clich√© but some imagery ("skeletal giants," "bruised sky") feels overused. Language veers toward ornate at the expense of clarity. Emotional subtext is often stated (e.g., "liberation from loss") rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story leans on poetic cohesion rather than narrative urgency. Assigned elements are mostly interconnected but occasionally feel checklist-driven (e.g., "steadily unpredictable"). Lingering impression is atmospheric but emotionally distant.</comment>
