<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment> Sigrid’s obsession with archiving emotions drives her actions, but Freya’s motivations are only partially fleshed out. Their dynamic is intriguing but limited by brevity; emotional revelations feel earned yet surface-level. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment> The wine tasting as a plot device works, but pacing stumbles—resolution feels abrupt. The overlooked era framing is effective, but the narrative arc lacks depth due to compression. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment> The reimagined longhouse’s sensory details (auroras, ghost flames) create a haunting atmosphere. However, some descriptions verge on excessive, diluting the setting’s authenticity. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment><question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment> Rich metaphors (ink as unspoken truths) and subtext about human connection resonate, but the story leans on lyrical excess over nuanced emotional showing. The ending is poignant but slightly overwrought. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment> Some phrases (“hush of an overlooked era”) feel generically poetic. The wine tasting and inkwell add originality, but emotional archiving borders on cliché. Prose balances lushness and purpose, though unevenly. </comment>
