<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's transition from cook to researcher lacks depth; traits insufficiently linked to actions or motivations. Core traits remain underdeveloped despite symbolic objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc is compressed but coherent. Pacing balances urgency and introspection, though resolution feels slightly rushed within constraints. Concept-driven plot maintains logical flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting's decayed grandeur and seismic imagery create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details (dust cascading, etched notches) effectively immerse and reinforce thematic decay.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with original premise. Some phrases ("frenzied tranquility") risk abstraction, but overall maintains fresh perspective through seismographic symbolism and existential dread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively toward revelatory ending. Short length highlights concision but occasionally sacrifices nuanced character development in favor of thematic momentum.</comment>
