<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Main character's repression informs actions but lacks layered exploration of how repressed traits evolve; motivation through doubt is clear but underdeveloped in emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing is uneven—spontaneous decision feels abrupt, ambush section is well-paced while other sections drag; resolution ties to opening but lacks gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail, creating a distinct apocalyptic-yet-beautiful atmosphere that reinforces decay and creation; overuse of metaphors occasionally dilutes immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolic use of perfume bottle/brambles elevate craft, but thematic underdevelopment (e.g., "cosmic verse" remains abstract) limits full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés through inventive pairing of decay with poetic transcendence; some purple prose but fresh juxtapositions (feral dogs as "guardians") and subtext of fear-as-inspiration elevate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but brief length leaves themes underbaked; lingering mood of existential struggle suggests depth, though resolution feels rushed for high-tier literary standards.</comment>
