<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's skittishness is superficially shown through pacing and clutching shoes, but inner turmoil lacks visceral immediacy; motivation to access the subconscious is clear but underexplored in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Static plot structure relies on internal monologue without narrative stakes or external tension; metaphorical mending lacks concrete progression, undermining arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric contrasts between sterile lunar tech and frontier warmth are evocative, but the barbershop hush conceit feels strained; sensory details dominate over organic worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors strain for profundity (looms, subconscious as fabric); some lyrical moments undercut by overwrought abstractions; emotional resonance is intellectualized rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elevated prose borders on purple; ballet shoes/loom symbolism leans on clichéd associations; the tone’s "rustic refinement" reads as inconsistent aesthetic layering rather than character-driven voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition evident, but execution prioritizes style over emotional grounding; thematic cohesion between lunar isolation and psychological mending is implied but not fully earned.</comment>
