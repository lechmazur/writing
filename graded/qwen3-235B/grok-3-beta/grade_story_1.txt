<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rapidly sketched fears shape actions but lack psychological depth; motivation to conquer them is clear but one-dimensionally desperate</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Triumphant arc intact despite compressed timeframe, but garage sale backstory feels tacked on; knot-unraveling stretches plausibility while driving plot</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eerie sensory details immerse readers, but the "mundanely spiritual" concept remains vague; pyramid setting thematically linked yet underexplored</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains generic phrasing ("weight of forgotten fears"); metaphors functional rather than inventive; character reactions feel rehearsed</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overstuffed with required elements; garage sales and pyramid feel juxtaposed rather than integrated; tightness of prose sacrifices thematic richness</comment>
