<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains ethereal concept rather than living entity; motivations stated abstractly without emotional grounding or personal stakes; reactions to objects feel decorative rather than revealing of core personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks concrete progression â€“ healing galaxies through song feels vague and unearned; cause/effect between actions and outcomes are mystical hand-waving; circular structure ends where it began with no visible transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visually rich setting overwhelmed by excessive metaphors; sensory details vivid but unevenly distributed; atmospheric elements like solar winds and ghostly keeper create intriguing tension between cosmic scale and intimate moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Imagery impresses but lacks thematic heft; "renewal" theme remains superficial despite surface-level repetitions; emotional impact diluted by constant abstraction; literary devices rarely deepen into meaningful subtext.</comment>
