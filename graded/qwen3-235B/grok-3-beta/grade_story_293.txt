<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's nervousness and longing for escape are established but remain surface-level; her motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of conflict or growth beyond the final decisive action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A clear narrative arc exists within the word limit, but pacing issues arise in transitioning from internal contemplation to the festival crowd; coherence is maintained but lacks nuanced buildup to the climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bioluminescent city and microbial decay create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere, but the setting’s integration with Elara’s personal journey feels underexplored beyond symbolic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like the guttering candle and star patterns provide thematic cohesion, but emotional resonance is diluted by overtly stated feelings rather than fully immersive subtext.</comment>
