<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped inner conflict as sharp-witted dancer; linguistic ineptitude inconsistently manifests despite dance-as-expression framework. Prophecy motivation remains abstract rather than viscerally motivating.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Photo ritual provides structural backbone but underdelivers thematic connection to spaceship patch/prophetic elements. Pacing uneven—rushed resolution undermines slow-burn ambivalence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Abstract setting undermines thematic resonance: "sterile, mirrored" chamber lacks tangible sensory anchoring beyond visual cues. Timeframe of bubble baths poorly integrates with experimental chamber's conceptual purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective subtext in dance-as-defiance motif and mirrored-reality metaphors, but emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on conceptual abstraction over embodied storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visionary elements constrained by formulaic existential pondering. Some fresh intersections (spaceship patches as prophetic denial symbols) undermined by cliché "weight of destiny" metaphors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Forced integration of elements—spaceship relic, experimental chamber, and linguistic barriers feel conceptually juxtaposed rather than organically interwoven into cohesive narrative ecosystem.</comment>
