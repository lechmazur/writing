<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are emotionally grounded and consistent, though some emotional transitions could be more gradual; voice occasionally lacks distinctness in introspective passages.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Coherent emotional arc anchored by moon trail pursuit, though pacing slightly uneven in middle sections despite strong thematic cohesion throughout the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid but unevenly distributed sensory detailsâ€”desert visuals strong, but other senses underutilized; setting integration varies between atmospheric moments and thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fully realized metaphors (thread/moonlight as memory bridges) elevate emotional impact; ending succeeds as thematic payoff rather than contrived resolution, though some lines verge on over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh interpretive angle (tracking celestial phenomena as therapeutic ritual) counters mild "purple prose" tendencies; emotional progression feels organic despite some familiar grief-reconciliation tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into resonant whole despite partial setting underdevelopment; brevity feels intentional but slights deeper cultural exploration of caravan dynamics; lingering emotional resonance strong.</comment>
