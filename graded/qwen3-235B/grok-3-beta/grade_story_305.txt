<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; his reticence feels present but underexplored. The connection between his technical mischief and scholarly persona is hinted but not fully integrated into his voice or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to resolution, but the word limit creates rushed pacing in the climax. The convergence of echoes feels abrupt, weakening cause-effect clarity. Begins and ends with a thematic arc but lacks narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described (lanterns, decay, water), and the cake’s aroma contrasts effectively with decay. However, the flooded opera house’s symbolic connection to the plot is underutilized, and sensory details occasionally prioritize style over substance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (cake as hope, echoes as rebellion) add depth, but emotional resonance relies too heavily on descriptive language rather than character introspection. The ending is satisfyingly whimsical but lacks thematic boldness. Shows promise in subtext but remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; flooded opera house and cake-baking timeframe are inventive. Tone occasionally veers toward overly ornate prose, but originality in combining surreal elements (e.g., summoning echoes via knock patterns) elevates it. Subtlety in character psychology is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist cohesively but could deepen thematic synergy. The brevity feels intentional, prioritizing mood over narrative density. Leaves a lingering impression of surrealism but lacks urgent emotional stakes.</comment>
