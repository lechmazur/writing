<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of emotional complexity; the street performer's block and desire for reconciliation drive actions but inner struggles remain surface-level</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Predictable arc from block to breakthrough lacks tension; pivotal coral memory feels rushed despite effective emotional payoff; pacing uneven between atmospheric details and plot progression</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge creates vivid sensory immersion through specific mechanical/organic contrasts; setting enriches thematic tension between technological advancement and natural memory triggers</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains familiar steampunk tropes; some overly ornate descriptions ("clamor of patrons and hiss of steam") verge on purple prose; emotional subtext could be more subtly conveyed</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements feel dutifully incorporated rather than organically integrated; short form serves character study well but constrains deeper exploration of complex themes</comment>
