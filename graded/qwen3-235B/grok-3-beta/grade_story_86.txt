<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's apprehension is present but underdeveloped; motivation to rescue truth feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Growth arc exists but lacks nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists within constraints, but pacing in descent/corruption-fighting section feels rushed. Logical gaps in algorithmic antagonism and resolution mechanics detract from coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually rich cyberpunk setting with strong imagery, though virtual hot air balloon festival creates tonal dissonance. Some atmospheric elements (e.g., candle, borrowed dawn) integrate better than others (floating orbs of light).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (candle/compression cycles) operate effectively, ending provides thematic resonance. Some emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction rather than earned character development. Writing style occasionally sacrifices clarity for ornamentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids total predictability but contains derivative cyberpunk tropes and emotionally schematic symbolism. Language vacillates between vivid specificity and purple-prosey abstraction. Conceptual framework shows ingenuity but execution reveals AI-writing artifacts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element overload strains cohesion - many components feel like checklist rather than organic story growth. Strong thematic core exists but overambitious construction undermines impact. Final image carries emotional weight despite structural flaws.</comment>
