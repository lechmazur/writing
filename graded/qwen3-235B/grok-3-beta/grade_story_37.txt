<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict exploration; motivations exist but lack psychological depth and consistent behavioral proof. Assigned traits inconsistently shape actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Logical cause-effect chain with ritual climax, but compressed pacing undermines emotional payoff; forced detour feels like narrative scaffolding rather than organic development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in canopy setting with rope bridges, medicinal herbs, and twilight canopy rituals, but generic "ancient boughs" descriptions dilute uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic scaffolding (flame = redemption, sheet music = past) with thematic resonance, but first-person immediacy lacking. Catharsis achieved through underdog yodel revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mix of fresh fire spirit mythology and overused redemption tropes. Village healer archetype feels algorithmically generated rather than mythologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements (yodel, canopy village) tightly integrated, but peripheral components (construction detour) feel forced. Story maintains momentum but lacks literary distinctiveness.</comment>
