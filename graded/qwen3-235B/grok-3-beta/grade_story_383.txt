<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality evident in cosmic-meets-mundane framing; some phrases touch on purple prose, but the unique perspective avoids genre clichés with calculated absurdity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interweave skillfully, though occasional disconnects in tone and execution prevent transcendent cohesion; compact length feels intentional, not restrictive.</comment>
