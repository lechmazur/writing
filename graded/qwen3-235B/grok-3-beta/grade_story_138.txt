<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation for uncovering truth is clear but thinly psychological; noble identity shapes actions yet lacks depth beyond plot function; "hollow recklessness" manifests as self-harm but isn't fully tied to decision-making; dialogue with drone feels archetypal rather than individuated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by text messages and drone revelations works within constraints, but resolution feels abrupt; timeline compression (between texts) creates tension but sacrifices emotional progression; cause-effect ties between stubs, scans, and epiphany lack complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Combustion lab's sensory overload (ash/fire/metal) creates vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere; setting mirrors character decay but occasionally feels decorative; connection to ticket stub mysteries and familial erasure could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (drone as fractured identity, stubs as memory fragments) elevate narrative; emotional impact is undercut by overexplained themes ("hollow recklessness" as repeated descriptor); ending lands but lacks poetic finality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by clich√©d descriptors ("hollow echo," "gilded halls") and formulaic sentence structures; drone and ticket stubs avoid trope status but suffer from repetitive adjectives; balance between atmospheric detail and thematic overstatement is uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine competently but lack architectural synergy; brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional; thematic coherence wavers in favor of surface-level symbolic gestures; memorable fragments exist, but holistic impact is fragmented.</comment>
