<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but psychological depth is underdeveloped; the desert wanderer's transition to archivist lacks visceral transformation, and "loaded curiosity" remains more theoretical than emotionally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing manages the word limit competently, but the cosmic alignment payoff feels abrupt; cause-effect relationships between everyday miracles and the conclusion lack layered progression necessary for full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding contains striking visual juxtapositions (nebula/orchard, crow's nest/space pirates), but atmosphere lacks sensory cohesion; the desert past and futuristic setting never fully merge into a unified emotional landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ruler/loop/miracles) and theme ("love as circuit") are intellectually provocative, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition; the ending resonates conceptually but needs stronger "showing" of synthetic connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into elevated diction ("mirage like the oases of his desert past") and conceptual scaffolding; the "authentically artificial" idea is intriguing yet risks sounding like philosophical abstraction rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than intertwine organically; "orchard's last apple" and "everyday miracles" provide narrative scaffolding but lack visceral urgency; the brevity occasionally feels restrictive rather than purposeful.</comment>
