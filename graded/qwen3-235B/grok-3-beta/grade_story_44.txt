<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation shown through Lila's interactions with the lamp and carnival tickets, but emotional depth lacks complexity; her intellectual playfulness is demonstrated through banter but not fully woven into character decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression with cause-effect via ticket-lamp transformation, but abrupt shifts (e.g., car rides juxtaposed with studio scenes) weaken cohesion within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., stardust tools, rattling truck) enrich the setting, but the fusion of space debris and carnival elements feels thematically disjointed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbols (lamp as redemption) are effective, and the ending ties to the theme, but explicit exposition (e.g., "fight to keep ancient methods alive") undercuts subtlety in emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fresh combination of retro (grandfather's lamp) and futuristic elements avoids clich√©s; occasional ornate phrasing ("vine-like patterns") detracts slightly but overall originality stands out.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, though some (e.g., "quietly bold" tone) feel underdeveloped; the short form works as a vignette but lacks narrative weight for long-term impact.</comment>
