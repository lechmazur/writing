<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Potential for complex characterization undercut by vague motivations; "suspiciously trusting" informs actions but lacks psychological depth; voice inconsistent between brooding determination and whimsical metaphors</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Shattered mirrors create haunting spatial metaphor; leaf-raking season juxtaposes cyclical normalcy against supernatural decay; tactile details (crunching glass, wax texture) effectively immerse but underutilize olfactory/thermal sensations</comment>
