<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of nuanced psychological depth; motivation is conceptually clear but underdeveloped through action or introspection; character serves more as thematic vessel than living entity with organic behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc exists but feels compressed; transitions between DNA alignment and catharsis lack visceral progression; cause-effect logical but emotionally detached</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stylish sensory elements (neon trees, falling fruit) well-rendered but sometimes function as surface-level adornment rather than narrative soil; setting-persona interplay inconsistent</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric density impressive (bell as fractured self, DNA as redemption code); emotional resonance diluted by excessive abstraction; ending conceptually satisfying, visceral impact lacking</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original DNA-mapping approach elevates premise; cyberpunk tropes (enforcers, neon) undercut freshness; some phrases ("electric tears") verge on purple prose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Precisely assembled clockwork of elements, but tension between artificiality and organic emotion remains; brevity showcases efficiency, not transcendence</comment>
