<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows expected arc but momentum falters when jumping between scenes. Temporal echoes concept inconsistently applied. Sudden confrontation lacks sufficient setup within word constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Balances freshness and clich√© through quantum mysticism fusion, though "eloquently clumsy" trope feels artificial. Character reasoning occasionally strains plausibility, especially final confrontation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesive yet unremarkable synthesis of elements; length feels restrictive rather than intentional. Conceptual framework overshadows emotional resonance or narrative innovation.</comment>
