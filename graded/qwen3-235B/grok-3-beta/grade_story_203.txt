<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's traits effectively shape actions and motivations, but emotional depth could be more nuanced. Motivation is consistent but occasionally stated rather than revealed organically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with symbolic progression, but the tight word limit leads to slightly rushed pacing and insufficient resolution of thematic threads.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details in key moments, but the orbital setting occasionally lacks tactile immediacy and deeper environmental integration with the character’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Employment of metaphor (e.g., wildflowers as inherited lies) and subtext enhances thematic layers, though some phrasing edges toward overwritten lyricism rather than seamless integration with narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by blending exorcism with spacefaring decay. Occasionally uses ornate descriptors, but originality in combining elements (e.g., haunted orbital debris) elevates the narrative above AI-generated formulae.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Successfully weaves assigned elements into a cohesive whole, though the brevity occasionally strains thematic payoff. Conceptual ambition outweighs narrative closure.</comment>
