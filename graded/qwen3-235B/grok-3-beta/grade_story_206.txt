<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Maris’s vendetta drives the plot, but her character lacks depth beyond vengeance; her candy-sculpting skill is a plot device, not a nuanced trait, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot connects beginning to end, but pacing feels rushed; the rebellion’s impact on timeframe is underdeveloped, and the method of revenge via candy clues strains plausibility within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting offers gothic visuals (e.g., “cobwebs draped like ghostly veils”), but atmosphere remains static and disconnected from character depth or thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (candy as deceit) and thematic hints about legacy vs. revenge exist, but emotional impact is diluted by overreliance on explicit exposition rather than subtext or layered symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Reliance on revenge tropes and overly ornate phrasing (“furnace of unresolved grief”) undermines originality; the locket’s reveal feels formulaic, and candy-clue gimmickry lacks psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Story coalesces around its premise but feels constrained by checklist-like integration of elements; stylistic flourishes overshadow narrative cohesion, leaving little lingering impact beyond surface intrigue.</comment>
