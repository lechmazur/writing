<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially developed but lack nuanced psychological depth; Kael's actions align with his "impulsively thoughtful" trait, but Elara's internal conflict remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but constrained by the tight word limit; the charcoal ritual drives momentum, though the abrupt conclusion feels rushed and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (bioluminescence, crumbling machinery) immerse the reader, but the "social upheaval" context remains superficially integrated, diluting thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (charcoal sigil as lifeline) and lyrical metaphors elevate the narrative, but deeper thematic subtext and character complexity are missing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Risks clich√©d post-apocalyptic tones but offsets this with original details (charcoal lore). Some overwrought phrasing ("fractured grace") distracts from emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story cohesively incorporates elements but prioritizes atmosphere over structural ambition; the ending lingers thematically but lacks narrative surprise or subtextual richness.</comment>
