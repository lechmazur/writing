<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong visual motifs but underdeveloped backstory elements; motivation to reawaken beauty remains abstract rather than demonstrated through concrete character struggles or transformations</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Non-linear progression works within word constraints, though the quiet tuning method feels narratively underexplored; achieves thematic resolution without fully satisfying plot mechanics</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric unity outweighs functional but predictable character arcs; brevity enhances poetic resonance while constraining deeper narrative complexity</comment>
