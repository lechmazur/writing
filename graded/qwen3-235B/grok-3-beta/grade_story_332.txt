<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's 'fiercely gentle' nature is shown through contrasting brushstrokes, but motivation lacks visceral urgency. Confessions feel more like curated affectations than raw emotion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure has elegant symmetry (notepad to painting), but pacing feels compressed. Leap to bridge cosmic divide lacks sufficient emotional or narrative scaffolding in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exo-garden is vividly realized through specific details (bioluminescent orchids, synthetic air). Atmosphere becomes almost sentient, mirroring character's internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic use of notepad/stage curtains. Ending remains emotionally diffuse; theme of bridged distances feels aspirational rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some overwritten passages ("ferociously gentle") border on poetic excess. Emotional subtext exists but occasionally veers into abstract universality over human specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into atmospheric whole, though thematic ambition occasionally outpaces execution. Lingering question about whether cosmic distance mirrors emotional repression.</comment>
