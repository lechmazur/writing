<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is clear but her transformation from clerk to interdimensional traveler feels rushed and underexplored. Her connection to the stamps is established but lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed. The trivia night catalyst and sudden quantum leap lack developmental pacing. Logical cause-effect exists but tightword limit hampers full cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details (bioluminescence, coral shadows) immerse effectively. Some setting elements (trivia night) feel disconnected from the overall aquatic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric use of stamps as interdimensional bridges and coral as disease motif. Emotional resonance slightly undercut by occasional overtelling rather than showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of marine dystopia with quantum theory avoids genre tropes. Some ornate descriptions border on purple prose, but conceptual execution shows ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements coexist rather than fully coalesceâ€”trivia night and stamps feel somewhat forced. Brevity works conceptually but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
