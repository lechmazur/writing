<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strengths: Compassion as a double-edged sword is compelling, and survival motivation drives action. Weakness: Internal conflict between traits feels underexplored; "sometimes always" phrasing muddies consistency in voice and motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Strong central action with visceral momentum; sun-shadow navigation ties to timeframe. Weakness: Rushed resolution beneath the track; cause/effect between astral vulnerability and physical escape lacks full integration within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strengths: Carnival decay evoked masterfully through tactile details (rusted steel, wind's howl). Atmosphere flawlessly mirrors psychological states. Weakness: Timeframe restriction occasionally undercuts atmospheric depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strengths: Tension between vulnerability and resilience resonates thematically with survival metaphor. Weakness: Heavy exposition burdens opening; emotional subtext could be more subtly woven through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Astral projection adds unique twist; carnival setting avoids clich√© decay tropes. Weakness: "Sometimes always" phrasing feels algorithmic; occasional purple prose ("graveyard of joy turned to dread") dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Tight integration of survival theme with physical/mystical elements. Weakness: Some forced element placement (tracking sun shadows lacks organic believability); length exposes underdeveloped motivations.</comment>
