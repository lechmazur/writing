<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's apathy and defiance are clear thematically but lack emotional depth; motivations are consistent but underexplored beyond surface-level self-rebuke.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from resignation to resolve, but the meteor showers as a driving action feel underdeveloped; pacing is deliberate but occasionally static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("whispering clouds") create mood, but sensory details are unevenâ€”stone walls and scents are vivid, but the monastery's physics remain unexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (meteors, "tomb for dreams") and subtext about institutional confinement resonate, though emotional beats rely partially on stated feelings rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative leans on familiar tropes (disillusioned warrior, monastery exile) with minimal subversion; some ornate phrasing ("whispering clouds") veers into purple prose without deepening originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic urgency; the premise invites philosophical debate on freedom vs. duty but doesn't fully exploit its emotional or existential potential.</comment>
