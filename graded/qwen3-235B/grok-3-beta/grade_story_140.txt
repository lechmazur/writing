<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; reliance on superficial "tortured" traits without psychological nuance. The doll's symbolic repetition feels forced rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot arcs collapse under conceptual ambition. The planetarium encounter introduces illogical causal links. Pacing falters as atmospheric descriptions overwhelm narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere competently executed but constrained by overused circus tropes. Sensory details prioritize convention over innovation - shattered mirrors, dust motes simile lack visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Aestheticized metaphors ("fate once denied") dominate over genuine emotional engagement. The ending's cosmic pretensions feel hollow rather than resonant, with themes stated overtly rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Purple prose epidemic: "whisper of destiny," "circus of nightmares," "ink across the dawn." Tropes (haunted relic, celestial prophecy) surface unchallenged. Character psychology reduces to checklist: "tortured"=guilt+brokenness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Element integration superficial. Conceptual scaffolding visible through narrative skin. Length amplifies structural fragmentation rather than creating distilled power. No lingering impact beyond surface poetry.</comment>
