<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>AR-7's nostalgia and role as caretaker are consistently shown through memory echoes, but traits like "anxiously fearless" and "brazen modesty" often feel stated rather than demonstrated. The motivation to preserve legacy is clear but occasionally undermined by mechanical dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal-based resolution works but lacks technical specificity. Pacing balances tension and brevity but rushes the stabilization sequence. The cause-effect chain is logical yet feels streamlined to serve the word limit rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The levitating cliffside facility and dawn setting create visual drama. Sensory contrasts between humming machinery and organic crystal growth work well, though atmospheric details occasionally veer toward clich√© (e.g., "echoes of human trust").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "guardian of a floating dream" resonate. The theme of preserving legacy through sacrifice emerges strongly, though emotional beats like AR-7's "nostalgic core" hum occasionally cross into sentimentalism without sufficient subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI writing pitfalls with concrete imagery, but phrases like "charged air" and "trembling circuits" border on generic. Some emotional beats are shown through action (crystal placement), but "patterns of betrayal" explanation feels over-clarified.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story expertly unites nostalgia and legacy themes, though the forced integration of "brazen modesty" and "fizz" as discrete elements reveals seams. The dawn timeframe effectively compresses tension into a tight narrative arc.</comment>
