<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Kael's motivation for immortality is clear but lacks emotional depth; his singular obsession drives actions but fails to reveal nuanced layers of his character beyond the intellectual pursuit of transcendence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but feels rushed in transitions; cause-effect logic is maintained yet pacing stumbles in condensed sections like the archive's discovery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details like fungal murals and humming servers immerse readers; atmosphere skillfully reinforces the desolate, timeless tone essential to the post-star setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (headlamp as burden, digitization as rebirth) and subtext on mortality; theme of transcending entropy is memorable, though emotional resonance is somewhat distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original blend of cyberpunk and anthropological themes avoids clich√©s; writing occasionally veers into ornate phrasing but generally maintains a distinct voice and subverts genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>All elements are cohesive yet uneven in execution; the brief length amplifies existential themes but undermines deeper exploration of character and worldbuilding nuances.</comment>
