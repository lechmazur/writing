<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character's subtlety is evident but underexplored; motivation for seeking wisdom lacks tangible action or conflict, leaving abstract development without emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks narrative propulsion beyond contemplation; schematic’s discovery initiates the plot but fails to escalate tension or resolve, resulting in a static arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative, sensory-rich setting mirrors thematic duality of stasis and hidden meaning; petrified forest’s imagery enhances tone and character introspection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere and theme are cohesive but unevenly weighted; tight integration of elements is hampered by underdeveloped character dynamics and plot complexity.</comment>
