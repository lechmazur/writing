<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but internal conflict lacks depth; actions align with traits but voice remains underdeveloped with minimal distinct narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels truncated; cause-effect connections are present, though the word limit undermines full realization of the climactic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal setting enhances themes with vivid sensory details, though some atmospheric descriptions border on clich√© (e.g., "ancient whispers").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some forced metaphors ("subtle paths unfolding") and overly ornate phrasing; originality in combining frost/leaves as ciphers elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively, though the brevity leaves thematic threads underexplored; lingering emotional impact anchors its publishability.</comment>
