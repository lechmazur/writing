<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's "peaceful anger" and motivation are present but lack nuanced development; actions often feel archetypal rather than psychologically complex. "Regularly seldom" trait remains underexplored despite narratorial emphasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; key transitions (e.g., from discovery to vow) lack emotional or logical momentum. Crypt exploration's cause-effect chain is logical but perfunctorily executed within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere through tactile details (cold flute, dusty archives) but requires more specificity. Connection between extinct language and bone flute's carvings needs deeper integration into spatial/chronological framework.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Symbolic potential (flute as linguistic vessel) is promising but mostly stated rather than dramatized. Ending resolves thematically but lacks visceral emotional resonance through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains semi-formulaic elements (hidden crypt visions, angry-reverent protagonist). Some originality in merging linguistic extinction with musical relic but execution remains mid-tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but lack inventive synergy. Writing demonstrates competence without distinctive voice or structural daring. Brief form feels restrictive rather than artistically intentional.</comment>
