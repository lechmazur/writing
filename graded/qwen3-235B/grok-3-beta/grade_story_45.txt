<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks psychological nuance beneath poetic surface, motivation stated rather than embodied through complex decisions. Guilt remains abstract despite symbolic green growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by external events rather than character choices. Resolution feels contrived - geomagnetic storm/rainbow chamber connection underdeveloped within tight frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory synthesis - bioluminescent cuneiform and vibrating ice violin create immersive uncanny atmosphere that elevates conceptual elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "dull radiance" carry thematic weight, but emotional payoff diluted by excessive abstraction. Redemption arc resolves too cleanly for demanding literary standards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by uneven execution - phrases like "silent overture" verge on clich√©d. Magical realism elements follow predictable emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competently unified elements but lacks narrative daring. The fusion of ancient/futuristic evokes wonder without achieving true transcendence.</comment>
