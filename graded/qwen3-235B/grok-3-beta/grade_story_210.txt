<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains shallow despite descriptive traits; motivation exists primarily as exposition rather than driving action. Lacks consistent behavioral specificity to embody "amiable scholar" beyond superficial labels.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Static structure relies too heavily on atmospheric description over narrative progression. Resolution feels abrupt rather than earned within compressed timeframe, with underdeveloped cause-effect mechanics between elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through tactile decay and spectral resonance creates memorable setting. Atmosphere occasionally overwhelms narrative purpose but effectively manifests emotional states through environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Proficient use of metaphor (crossword as historical quest) shows thematic intent but lacks emotional urgency. Implied subtext about academic rebellion remains underexplored despite promising foundations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some evocative phrasing compensates for generic descriptors and occasionally overwrought adjectives. Avoids complete formulaicity through original similes but occasionally slips into expectable genre conventions rather than subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements assembled competently but not organically integrated. Attempts at thematic cohesion present but undermined by disproportionate focus on aesthetic details over dramatic momentum within limited scope.</comment>
