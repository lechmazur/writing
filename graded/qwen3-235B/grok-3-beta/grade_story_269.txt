<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond established tropes; motivations drive actions but emotional depth feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Storm-driven confessions structure plot but pacing falters under word constraints; cause-effect logic strained by abrupt thematic transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Steampunk setting vividly rendered through tactile details (e.g., brass, hissing steam) but atmospheric cohesion weakened by uneven metaphorical weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance undermined by reliance on stated abstractions ("hopeful desperation") over visceral subtext; symbolic mirror concept compelling but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overfamiliar trope amalgamation (steampunk + parallel lives) lacks subversion; prose occasionally veers into ornate vagueness; mechanical reveals feel plot-convenient.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Element integration mostly functional but not revelatory; brevity highlights underdeveloped themes; atmospheric fragments outweigh narrative permanence.</comment>
