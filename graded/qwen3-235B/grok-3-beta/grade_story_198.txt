<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and consistent actions tied to her assigned attributes, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level with some repetitive phrasing that diminishes nuance in her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the resolution feels rushed, and the pivotal revelation about the souls lacks sufficient setup to maximize emotional impact within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ethereal setting vividly rendered with rich sensory details, though deeper thematic ties between the atmosphere and conceptual themes (e.g., fragmentation, escape) could strengthen cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (spinning wheel, sun trails) effectively elevate the narrative, but some emotional beats rely on stated feelings rather than subtext, diluting the "show-don't-tell" impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and a surprising twist counterbalance occasional overuse of ornate phrasing and faintly formulaic descriptions of Mara's resolve, maintaining originality but not transcending genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere well in service of the story, though the brief length occasionally strains the depth of Mara's internal conflict, leaving the theme of self-reflection feeling underexplored.</comment>
