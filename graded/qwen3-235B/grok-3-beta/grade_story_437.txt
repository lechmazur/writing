<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness lacks clear narrative consequences; motivations about understanding flowers are asserted rather than demonstrated through actions that challenge or transform his weakness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has cohesive arc but relies on contrived symbols (photograph tears as a "map") to force momentum; resolution feels unearned despite atmospheric build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie greenhouse setting is vivid, but the toxic sky and rain feel more aesthetic than thematically integrated; sensory details occasionally overshadow narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and layered themes (human/nature decay, false faith) resonate, though some dialogue leans into cryptic vagueness rather than emotional precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality diluted by dystopian tropes (dying worlds, cult messiahs) and overly elaborate descriptions that border on purple prose without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cohesive but uneven execution; assigned elements form a functional skeleton, but the story lacks the transcendent clarity or risk-taking required for prestige markets.</comment>
