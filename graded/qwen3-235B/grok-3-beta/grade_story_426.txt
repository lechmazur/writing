<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character traits like "angrily peaceful" feel assigned rather than organically integrated. The marathon training and teapot symbolism hint at depth but lack emotional grounding to fully substantiate motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but relies overly on contrived elements (e.g., betrayal via playlist glitch). Pacing is efficient yet occasionally strained by the word limit, particularly in the Mara confrontation's abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush sensory details anchor the haunted carnival atmosphere. The setting's decay directly reflects Elias's mission to preserve crumbling traditions, though the marathon training feels tacked on without stronger thematic interweaving.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes around preservation vs. commodification resonate, but emotional beats (e.g., the hug) lack sufficient subtext. Striking imagery exists (cracked teapot) but leans on "telling" more than nuanced emotional conveyance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attempts originality through playlist hacking and aloof passion but includes clich√©d phrases ("serenity clashed within him"). Some atmospheric details feel derivative of gothic tropes, though the core folk medicine concept avoids obvious predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not exceptional; the teapot and setting stand out. The premise is ambitious but occasionally undermined by stylistic unevenness and underdeveloped character dynamics within the tight word constraint.</comment>
