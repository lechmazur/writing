<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. The "unusually usual" trait remains superficially sketched, and interactions lack emotional texture beyond symbolic gestures. The pivotal moment of prejudice dissolution feels abrupt rather than earned through behavioral progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot traces a clear arc of overcoming prejudice, but pacing within tight constraints uneven—crucial emotional shifts occur hastily. The connection between beginning (loneliness) and end (transformation) is logical but lacks intermediary beats that would make the resolution feel inevitable rather than imposed. Concept drives plot more effectively than character logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport's decayed grandeur permeates the narrative with visceral sensory details (rust, whispering echoes). Atmosphere supports thematic resonance of rebirth through decay, though some elements (phantom train ticket's "otherworldly patina") verge on surreal abstraction without concrete-world integration. The setting's haunting beauty occasionally overshadows character development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor effectively (ticket punch as tool to "decay old fears") and subverts genre expectations by placing sci-fi aesthetics in an intimate emotional context. The theme of touch-as-currency in a fractured society resonates, though emotional impact is diluted by slightly mannered prose. Ending balances thematic closure with poetic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most sci-fi clichés by focusing on quiet emotional rebellion rather than explosions, but some phrases ("whispers of bygone interstellar dreams") border on purple prose. The phantom ticket's cosmic history strains credibility slightly. Character psychology leans more on conceptual symbolism than humanly specific quirks, occasionally reducing emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesion emerges from thematic cross-pollination of decay/redemption, but individual elements occasionally feel stacked rather than organically interwoven. The short form serves the story's contemplative tone well, though length constraints limit deeper exploration of the rich setting. Lingering impression of conceptual elegance outweighs character intimacy.</comment>
