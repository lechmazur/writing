<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines through the coathanger/postcard symbolism and introspective tone, with minimal formulaic language, though the solitary space emissary trope feels somewhat familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated with thematic purpose, but the brevity occasionally limits character and setting depth despite creative utilization of constraints.</comment>
