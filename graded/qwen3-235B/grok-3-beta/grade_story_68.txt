<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael’s moral code is consistent but underexplored; his actions align with his traits, but internal complexity remains superficial. The bottle caps as tokens hint at depth but lack narrative expansion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pacing is uneven—the climax feels rushed despite tight constraints. The connection between the tea’s steeping and the mission’s urgency lacks full integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The neo-Roman marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details, blending ancient and futuristic elements. Atmosphere enhances thematic tension between history and erasure, though some connections to plot feel forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (rake/handled resolve) and subtext of memory/erasure resonate. Emotional impact is subdued; the ending resolves cleanly but lacks lingering resonance or layered meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (bottle caps as redemption tokens), but reliance on phrases like “monsters of code” and “confident uncertainty” veers into abstraction. Sensory details occasionally border on clichéd futurism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically, but the story leans on them as scaffolding rather than organic narrative forces. Brief length feels limiting, with themes hinted at over explored.</comment>
