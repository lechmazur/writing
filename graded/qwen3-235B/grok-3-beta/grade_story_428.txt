<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (banishing doubt) is clear but lacks psychological depth; Marcus’s transition from city planner to prepper remains superficially explored despite symbolic use of the ink blotter.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed—the handshake deal and constellation study lack causal connection; pacing prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum, leaving the arc unresolved within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but contextually thin; the temple’s decay and celestial carvings create mood, yet the setting remains backdrop rather than an active force shaping Marcus’s journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Relies on overused literary devices (e.g., broken constellations metaphor) without fresh insight; ending feels arbitrary rather than inevitable, weakening thematic resonance and emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Formulaic descriptors (“weathered altar,” “fervent doomsday prepper”) dominate; psychological nuances of escaping chains are stated, not demonstrated, and the tone veers into melodramatic prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but loosely woven; the brevity emphasizes atmosphere over cohesion, and no lingering thematic question emerges to elevate the narrative beyond surface-level genre tropes.</comment>
