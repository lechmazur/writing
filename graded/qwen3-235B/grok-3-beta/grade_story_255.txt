<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character’s analytical innovation and cynicism are hinted but underdeveloped; motivation is clear but lacks personal stakes; method via scent feels abstract, not deeply tied to character logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically, but reliance on scent-memory connection feels convenient; pacing is competent but resolution lacks tension; cause-effect is occasionally stretched for poetic cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere evocative (cracked windows, rain), enhances isolation; scent ties to method but could integrate more with setting’s decay; post-party timeframe feels underexploited, slightly jarring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery (rain as renewal, tower as tomb) and theme of delayed justice resonate; emotional impact is present but undercut by abrupt shifts; ending is purposeful yet risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes (e.g., lone hero decrypting justice); scent-driven decryption is novel but leans on poetic license over plausibility; avoids purple prose but skirts overabstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements feel mostly integrated but occasionally forced (post-party emptiness, scent logic); style is evocative yet strained; theme lingers but lacks ambiguity for deeper reflection.</comment>
