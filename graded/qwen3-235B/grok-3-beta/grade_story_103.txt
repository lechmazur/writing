<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character development is present but underexplored; motivations are clear but psychological depth lacks nuance. The knight's internal conflict is conceptually rich but feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but compressed; action progression feels slightly rushed. Logical causality exists but pivotal decisions lack sufficient tension buildup, compromising emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is extraordinarily vivid through precise sensory details (salt/sorrow, groaning door). The lighthouse prison’s symbolic and physical peril merges seamlessly with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in items and sacrifice; ending provides thematic closure but emotional impact could deepen. The "joyful agony" motif enriches subtext, though some literary devices feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality excels in concept synthesis (mirrored guilt objects, grudging sacrifice), but phrases like "joyful agony" verge on cliché. Emotional resonance shows nuance but occasionally relies on elevated abstraction over concrete human experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Framing elements (impossible choices, sacrifice) interlock cohesively. The brevity sharpens focus but underdevelops secondary motifs. Leaves lingering contemplation on redemption, though not transcendentally.</comment>
