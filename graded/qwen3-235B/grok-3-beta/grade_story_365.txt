<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but occasionally over-explained; the paradox of "independently dependent" lacks nuanced integration into actions beyond solitary effort. Emotional depth remains surface-bound despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot driven by the rope-reconfiguring method, but cause-effect for time alteration lacks logical foundation. Pacing struggles with repetitive descriptions, and resolution feels abrupt despite the self-contained arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory worldbuilding creates an immersive, melancholic atmosphere. The carnival’s decay mirrors the oracle’s state, though deeper connections between objects (rope, bottle) and setting could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphor use (e.g., rope as malleable time) and layered themes of redemption. Ending’s ambiguity serves the theme but weakens emotional payoff; tone fluctuates between poetic and overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Phrases like "melancholic glee" and "subconscious realm" feel clichéd. Emotional nuance is stated rather than shown, and overly ornate descriptions occasionally undercut the story’s gravity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements like the perfume bottle and carnival enhance the narrative, but others (dreamlike invitations, "independently dependent") feel tacked on. Style leans poetic but occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism.</comment>
