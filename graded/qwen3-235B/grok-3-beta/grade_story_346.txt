<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character transformation is clear but rushed; internal conflict hinted at yet thinly fleshed out. Motivation to escape fabrication drives plot but lacks nuanced psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot arc present but compressed, leading to abrupt transitions. Clear beginning/middle/end structure exists, but pacing feels uneven in tighter sections (e.g., armor removal without earned catharsis).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Imagery of wasp nest is vivid and thematically resonant, though tone occasionally veers into overwritten descriptions that obscure mood cohesion. Sensory details effectively oppressive but sometimes over-layered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (lint as ego debris, nest as mind labyrinth) are potent and thematically integrated. Ending resolves character arc cleanly but lacks lingering emotional complexity beyond surface redemption.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong originality in premise but lapses into florid prose ("balloon pops of hatching eggs," "intimately impersonal") that borders on affectation. Subtext is handled better than overt emotional declarations, though unevenly balanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully woven but occasionally strained (lint symbolism). Conceptual framework supports thematic coherence, though the brevity marginally hinders deeper character exploration without undermining structural integrity.</comment>
