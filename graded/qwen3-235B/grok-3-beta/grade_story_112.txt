<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (preserving recipes) is clear and drives actions, but psychological depth remains thin; reactions to objects like the handkerchief are symbolically consistent but lack visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a discovery → decoding → ritual arc, but pacing falters—hopscotch revelation feels abrupt; ending resolves too neatly given the abstract premise, sacrificing narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Decaying archive setting with sensory-rich decay and melancholic timelessness expertly amplifies the mournful elation tone; snowflake motif as temporal metaphor enhances atmosphere without overwhelming it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors (handkerchief as memory, hopscotch as coded ritual) elevate thematic cohesion; ending leans on familiar "reclamation of heritage" tropes but earns emotional impact through precise imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Strains toward lyrical originality but occasionally slips into ornate abstractions ("mournful elation," "vigilance"); some transitions between archive exploration and ritual feel algorithmically convenient rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements are mechanically cohesive but unevenly weighted; setting/atmosphere shine while character remains conceptually flattened; theme of cultural preservation resonates but lacks critical complexity.</comment>
