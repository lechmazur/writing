<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength in tying Eleanor's "hyperactively serene" demeanor to her actions and repression, but underdeveloped emotional progression limits depth. The sticker sheet and mixtapes effectively reveal her past, though her static portrayal prevents full character complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc with beginning (revisiting the past), middle (mixtape ritual), and end (release), but pacing is uneven. The "hollow victory" resolution feels abrupt despite the constrained length, and cause-effect links are occasionally strained by the steampunk elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (gears, steam, phonograph) create immersion and metaphorically mirror Eleanor’s internal struggle. However, the steampunk setting occasionally feels decorative rather than foundational, slightly disconnecting from the emotional core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Craft elements like the "clanking machinery as metaphor" and tactile act of peeling the sticker enhance theme and closure. Emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on explicit descriptors ("savage grace," "molten iron gaze") and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Attempts originality with paradoxical traits and steampunk-mixtape fusion, but generic descriptors ("whirring softly," "steam-laden air") and the mixtape device verge on cliché. Avoids total formulaicity but lacks distinctive voice or subversive twists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere unevenly—the sticker sheet and mixtapes are integral, while steampunk feels tangential. The story’s emotional tension hinges on specific objects, but the brief length sacrifices deeper thematic exploration, leaving the "hollow victory" concept underexplored.</comment>
