<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has surface consistency but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but not fully earned through lived experience or nuanced introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arc is present but pacing uneven; transitions between philosophical revelations feel rushed despite strong structural symmetry between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but occasionally overwhelms narrative—sensory details immerse but sometimes distract from character-driven momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic craft with sea glass/metaphors, but emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on declarative thematic statements rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Originality in combining steampunk-esque elements with existential themes, but purple prose peaks in storm descriptions; decoding microfilm verges on narrative contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but uneven execution—some assigned elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated into the story's DNA.</comment>
