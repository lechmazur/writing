<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Surface-level traits drive simplistic motivations; whimsy and impulsiveness aren't deeply integrated into character psychology or decision-making nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clearly structured but mechanical progression; cause-and-effect feels contrived at key points (shooting star revelation lacks narrative weight).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lush visuals and sonic immersion in setting, but atmospheric elements remain decorative rather than shaping plot or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Middling emotional impact; metaphorical depth present but shallowly explored, with resolution feeling overly tidy for thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Generically "magical" elements and overused descriptors; fresh handling of music inheritance theme undercut by formulaic romanticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competently integrated elements with no significant dissonance, though none elevate beyond baseline expectations for literary prestige.</comment>
