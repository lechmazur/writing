<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marla’s sassiness and rebelliousness are consistent but lack depth beyond surface-level quips; her academically mischievous trait is underexplored despite shaping her rebellion; her use of the camera and chests aligns with her motive, though her internal drives remain simplistic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fracturing the office’s order via chests creates a clear arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed in the 500-word constraint; the central action drives the plot logically, though the ending’s resolution lacks urgency or tension escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eminently vivid setting with twilight and machinery; sensory details (stardust, flickering screens) enhance mood; the Polaroid-camera-as-secret-keeper ties cohesively to the sterile, glitch-suppressing environment, though deeper atmospheric contrasts are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (cosmic stew, "velvet" twilight) are evocative but occasionally verge on cliché; the theme of controlled chaos is clear but lacks subtextual complexity; Marla’s voice is distinct yet one-note, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery counterbalanced by occasional purple prose ("whispers of rebellion in a world obsessed with control"); some phrases ("sanitized void") feel trope-heavy; character motivation aligns with actions but lacks nuance; metaphors are specific yet occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sufficiently cohesive within the word limit but leans heavily on stylistic flourishes; elements (camera, chests) are tightly woven yet occasionally feel contrived; the brevity works thematically but limits character/drive exploration; leaves an impression without lingering depth.</comment>
