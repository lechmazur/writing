<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weaknesses in Silas's internal consistency and depth of transformation; reliance on external catalyst (dummy) overshadows organic motivation. Strength in first-person voice tying to theme of redemption through language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression feels abbreviated; poetic ritual lacks narrative stakes. Beginning-to-end connection exists but sacrifices emotional weight for brevity. Strong alignment between transformation theme and poetry method.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunted engine room's sensory details (salt/decay/rust) masterfully amplify mood. Dummy's uncanny presence integrates seamlessly with setting's decayed grandeur. Atmosphere consistently supports thematic tension between stasis and change.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of dummy as muse and poetry as alchemy provides intellectual resonance. Ending feels thematically resolved but emotionally underdeveloped. Strong showing through subtext in object-character dynamics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through visceral metaphors ("scorching poise," "carve path through doubt"). Occasional ornate phrasing ("crucible for his words") borders on purple prose. Emotional shifts shown through action (clutching dummy) rather than telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Creative synthesis of elements (dummy as transformation symbol) elevates above formulaic character arcs. Some narrative compression strains plausibility. Lingering thematic question about art's redemptive power.</comment>
