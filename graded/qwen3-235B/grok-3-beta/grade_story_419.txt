<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thalia's traits shape her actions tangibly but lack psychological depth; her empathy and resolve are demonstrated but not deeply explored, making her more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has coherence and completion but leans on a narrow arc; the heartbeat motif drives rhythm more than plot mechanics, while cause-effect remains clear within limited scope.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate effectively despite word constraint; brevity feels intentional but prioritizes atmosphere over narrative complexity, leaving theme more stated than interrogated.</comment>
