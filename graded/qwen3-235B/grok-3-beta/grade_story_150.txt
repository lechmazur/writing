<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak consistency in Jericho's poetic "voice"; motivations implied but underexplored. Assigned traits (outlaw/poet) surface-deep. Reactions to dice/destiny lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Circular structure (dice rolls framing narrative) works within constraints, but climactic revelation feels abruptly executed. Pacing uneven during metaphysical shifts in wall texts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Steam/brass sensory motifs strongly establish steampunk patina, but observatory's mechanical setting remains atmospheric window dressing rather than narrative engine.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "crucible of obsession") occasionally ring hollow. Ambivalence theme surfaces but lacks emotional payoff. Ending's "chaos of intertwined destinies" feels predetermined rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Steampunk observatory avoids clich√© through textured machinery descriptions, but outlaw poet archetype and "shifting prophecy" trope lean on genre defaults without sufficient subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visual cohesion among elements exists, but tight word limit exposes structural seams. Attempts at thematic layering (fate vs. curiosity) remain schematic rather than organic.</comment>
