<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (interstellar secret via connection) is clear, and her grief over the button reveals depth, but her personal growth within the narrative remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing is deliberate, but the introspective "plot" lacks traditional momentum; coherence is maintained through atmosphere rather than cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liminal setting and sensory details (humming engines, nebulae shadows) create haunting immersion, though some descriptors verge on excessive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (button as failure, "thread of longing") and poetic imagery evoke emotional resonance; ending balances thematic closure with lingering hope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive elements (zeppelin library, "sharp gentleness"), though occasional ornate phrasing slightly detracts from clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated, with the story’s brevity enhancing its lyrical focus; some conceptual weight may elude readers seeking concrete narrative.</comment>
