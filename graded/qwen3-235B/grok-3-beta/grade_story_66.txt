<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underexplored; the connection between "quiet deserter" identity and actions feels surface-level despite poetic descriptions of inner conflict. The "dizzyingly grounded" attribute is evocatively stated but insufficiently dramatized through concrete behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented timeframe creates coherence struggles; cause-effect between mask reconstruction and carbonization feels artificially imposed rather than organically developed. Pacing unevenly distributes emotional weight across truncated narrative arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plant communication study setting is atmospherically rendered through synesthetic details (whispers, vibrations) that authentically enhance the carbonization method. Thermal sensory contrasts between violent war memories and cool botanical sanctuary create memorable environmental tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphor of carbonized memories as narrative transformation elevates the story, though philosophical musings occasionally border on didacticism. The ending's paradoxical resolution achieves thoughtful emotional resonance through disciplined sensory restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains traces of AI-generated poeticizing ("whispering ferns," "vibrating ivy"). Some metaphors (mirror fractures=mended resolve) border on schematic rather than revelatory. Emotional nuance exists without breaking fully from slightly mechanical pattern-making.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>High-concept elements cohere thematically but strain narrative plausibility through sheer density. The brief length works for lyrical abstraction but hinders deep character engagement. Conceptual execution impresses more than emotional authenticity.</comment>
