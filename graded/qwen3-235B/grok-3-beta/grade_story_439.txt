<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's muteness is visually rendered but insufficiently deepened through actions; motivation to seek meaning feels underexplored despite atmospheric cues; boldness manifests only in pivotal moments rather than continuous behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to portal creation with lyrical momentum, but pivotal actions (symbol-drawing, portal creation) lack procedural specificity; beginning/end connection exists but feels underweighted within tight constraints; comet's role disrupts internal logic slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storm-battered harbor and decaying opera house create a visceral, unified atmosphere; snowfall and celestial phenomena integrate with thematic silence; sensory details (crunching glass, icy wind) immerse readers without excess; setting actively enables the story's metaphysical pivot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story generates haunting emotional resonance through metaphor-laden prose; cosmic scale balances with intimate character psychology; "mind's escape" theme emerges organically yet ambiguously; strong imagery (silent resolve as "quiet song") elevates craftsmanship, but subtext remains surface-skimming.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction ("cautious enchantment," "whispered thoughts"); some descriptor clusters ("storm-battered," "decayed splendor") border on overwritten; character psychology feels human but undertested by extraordinary circumstances; execution shows style but not distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into cohesive whole despite ambitious assignment; prose discipline turns constraints into strengths; lingers emotionally through atmosphere more than narrative closure; brief length serves poetic intent but slightly flattens thematic potential.</comment>
