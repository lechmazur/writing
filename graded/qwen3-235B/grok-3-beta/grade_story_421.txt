<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's nomadic background and motivation to find harmony with nature are present but underdeveloped. Her "ferociously polite" demeanor is stated but lacks nuance in action or dialogue. The mariner’s wheel symbolizes her internal journey but fails to fully reveal her inner conflicts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot's intervention against the merchant creates tension but resolves too conveniently. Cause and effect (merchant's hesitation) feels abrupt, and the tight word limit leaves little room for gradual character shifts or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The workshop’s floral atmosphere is vivid and thematically relevant, but sensory details like pressed daisies and lavender only occasionally deepen the narrative rather than consistently grounding it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (mariner’s wheel as life’s storms) and "anguished joy" evoke layered emotions, and the ending’s bittersweet undertone lingers. However, subtext about nature’s fragility could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on poetic descriptors ("ferociously polite") that sometimes feel ornamental rather than integral. Elara’s internal struggles are occasionally told rather than shown through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story uses assigned elements purposefully but unevenly. The mariner’s wheel and intervention are vital; the secret mission group feels tacked on. The theme resonates, but the brevity strains narrative depth.</comment>
