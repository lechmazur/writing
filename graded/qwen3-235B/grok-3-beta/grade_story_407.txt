<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (studying plants for cosmic redemption) is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions (duel, honesty) align with traits but inner conflicts remain surface-level; unique voice diluted by overly poetic exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot propelled by shortcut encounter and duel, but resolution feels abrupt; cause/effect between cosmic plant studies and lizard people's fears is hinted but underdeveloped; pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive with bioluminescent flora and jade-scaled guards, but tactile/auditory details sparse; "bitter honey" tone inconsistently threaded; setting-object connection (sextant mapping underground) cleverly utilised.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memorable metaphor use (systematic chaos mirroring plot), emotional resonance in exile arc; theme of cosmic-earthbound connection effective; shows more than tells in plant descriptions but stumbles in dialogue-heavy duel.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s (unexpected lizard-plant cosmic link), but "spoken truths" resolution feels formulaic; some purple prose ("honey gone sour"); emotional subtext unevenly balanced between raw truths and stated bitterness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements loosely integrated: sextant/plants work better than colliding interests; tone and setting strong, but character depth sacrificed for plot; brief length feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
