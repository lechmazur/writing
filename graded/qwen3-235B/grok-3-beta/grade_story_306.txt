<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has vivid traits and consistent motivation, but depth is surface-level; madness obsession feels underexplored despite eccentric details.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular structure (obsession → obsession) lacks resolution; cathedral goal drives plot but ends on setup, weakening narrative arc within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Industrial chamber and shattered-glass cathedral create eerie atmosphere; sensory details like vibrating air and stained glass hum amplify tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror to soul, madness-as-escape) and visceral imagery add depth, but emotional impact is diluted by lack of payoff; ending teases rather than resolves.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combines tropes (fallen star, magic quests) inventively but occasionally veers into ornate prose; character psychology leans on clichés of madness over nuanced internal logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but incomplete-feeling; elements work together effectively yet feel like fragments of a broader narrative, lacking definitive weight for standalone impact.</comment>
