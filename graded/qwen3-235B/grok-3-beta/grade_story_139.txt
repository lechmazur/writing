<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's stubbornness drives actions but lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivation is clear but overly simplistic, internal conflict hinted but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; setup strong but progression feels rushed. Logical gaps in how tooth-mark analysis connects to plot resolution within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere evoke mood but lack cohesion; "cautious enchantment" contrasts with grittier details, weakening thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism with flute and reflection; emotional resonance from internal conflict. Over-reliance on descriptive abstractions slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in concept (tooth-mark method, dark reflection) but stumbles with forced metaphors ("heartbeat after a dream"). Originality evident but unevenly woven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically despite occasional contrivance; concise format serves as compelling prologue. Lingering thematic tension elevates cohesion.</comment>
