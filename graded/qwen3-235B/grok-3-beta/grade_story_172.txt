<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's unease and motivation are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth beyond assigned traits; "sharp gentleness" trait is underdeveloped despite being mentioned repeatedly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid cause-effect chain through the puzzle box mechanics, but the mansion's connection to the beach chamber feels under-explained; resolution's seismic shift relies on abrupt spectacle rather than buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seashell amplifies suspense through auditory and tactile details; mansion's architectural decay contrasts with the chamber's secrets; atmosphere intensely supports emotional weight but overly leans on conventional coastal horror tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors of reversed wishes and self-negation create thematic cohesion; ending lacks visceral emotional payoff despite clever paradox, undercutting the subtext about fate vs. self-determination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality in reversed wishes concept is dulled by reliance on "ancient prophecy" and "labyrinth" tropes; language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; emotional stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong integration of elements despite some feeling perfunctory (e.g., mansion's secrets); length works for urgency but limits thematic resonance; leaves curiosity about "sea's ancient voice" unresolved.</comment>
