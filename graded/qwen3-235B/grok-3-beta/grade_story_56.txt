<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation delivery; traits like "invisble allies" strain character logic. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite rich internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots on strong imagery but lacks clear resolution for key elements like the computer's restart. Pacing drags during internal monologue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere brilliantly merges decay and renewal through specific details like "gnarled roots" and "mosky floor," but some abstract descriptors ("cracked glass sky") dilute immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors about buried truths resonate, but emotional beats rely too heavily on telling Mara's reactions rather than showing nuanced responses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original setting weakened by cliched "spectral whispers" and overwrought transitions. Lyrical prose sometimes devolves into purple patches without sufficient thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong individual elements compete rather than coalesce. The forced brevity creates narrative tension but undermines emotional stakes and thematic complexity.</comment>
