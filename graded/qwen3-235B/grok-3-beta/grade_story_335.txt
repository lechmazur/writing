<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in tying the amber relic to Torren’s guilt and hollowed identity, but motivation remains abstract; lacks visceral emotional layers despite symbolic grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent redemption arc, but pacing feels hurried—crypt ritual’s emotional payoff lacks build-up; cause-effect between rumors and actions is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere blends decay and artistry; sensory details (crunching mosaics, glowing amber) immerse readers effectively. Timeframe’s "echoing hour" enhances mood but feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (amber, graffiti, shadows) elevates theme of confronting the past. Ending is purposeful but emotionally muted; deeper subtext could strengthen resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stylistically rich but occasionally veers into cliché (e.g., "fragments of a story," "ghosts only he could see"). Avoids overt tropes but risks ornate abstraction over visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not fully synergistic; amber and setting excel, while "rumor chains" and "careful recklessness" feel tacked on. Themes linger but lack transformative depth.</comment>
