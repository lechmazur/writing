<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's sincerity is evident but rebellion lacks depth; motivation for preserving traditions feels abstract rather than rooted in personal history; use of "torn sticky note" as a symbolic object reveals determination but voice remains generic and insufficiently distinct through narration</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks dynamic progression; "theorize" action and static setting create inertia; loose cause-effect between secrets and spirits calming; abrupt shifts in emotional pacing (bitter/hopeful) without sufficient narrative justification; incomplete arc within word limit</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Haunted passage's atmosphere is vividly rendered but over-reliant on clichéd Gothic tropes; sensory details (flickering shadows, damp fog) effective but repetitive; "braided bitterness" tonal motif feels forced rather than naturally emerging from setting; poor integration of "between storms" timeframe with physical/spiritual struggle</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors ("bitter braid," "living walls") dominate over subtler literary devices; emotional resonance undermined by explicit telling; repetitive phrasing weakens thematic impact; ending fails to resolve central tension between tradition/change; "showing" through character action is minimal despite atmospheric detail</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Overuse of stock Gothic imagery ("whispers lingered like damp fog") and abstract adjectives ("braided bitterness") suggests formulaic writing; metaphors generic rather than surprising; emotional states repeatedly stated rather than embodied; tonal inconsistencies and overwrought descriptions qualify as purple prose; execution aligns closely with AI-generated clichés</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elements superficially incorporated but lack narrative integration; atmospheric consistency achieved at cost of thematic depth; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; central conflict (individual vs. change) remains under-explored; fails to leave lingering resonance beyond Gothic pastiche</comment>
