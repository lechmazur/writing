<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and obsessive poetry shape motivation and actions, but internal conflict lacks sufficient complexity to fully justify transformation. The non-violent power pursuit feels somewhat abstract rather than organically personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from obsession to realization, but the subway timeframe feels tacked on rather than structurally integral. Resolution arrives abruptly without sufficient emotional groundwork for the surrender to feel earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunted attic's eerie atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory details, enhancing the whispers' unsettling presence. Botanical samples effectively reinforce both setting decay and thematic tension between life/death.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric use of botanical decomposition parallels inner turmoil, but ending's thematic "surrender" feels underexplored. The story's emotional core remains slightly diffuse despite potent imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original handling of "warning whispers" as active antagonistic force rather than passive trope. Avoids overused haunted house clich√©s through poetic abstraction, though "meticulously messy" occasionally veers toward stylized pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Cohesion exists but relies excessively on atmospheric scaffolding to unify disparate elements. Short length exposes some underdeveloped thematic intersections, though the haunting tone leaves lingering resonance.</comment>
