<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak internalization and inconsistent apathy; motivation shift feels abrupt and externally imposed rather than organically earned through character choices. The "enthusiastically lazy" trait remains superficially gestural rather than shaping decisions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Linier structure meets narrative skeleton but lacks emotional escalation; repetitive frame-matching process dilutes tension while the divine timeframe premise under-delivers thematic payoff. Pacing oscillates between sluggish coffee rituals and rushed transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually rich dream-studio imagery creates atmosphere, but fails to leverage other senses (taste of ocean air, tactile coral textures). The dying god's breath concept remains atmospheric window-dressing rather than worldforming backbone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors show potential (coral as psychic architecture) but emotional resonance is muted by abstract distance. Ending's thematic declaration feels tacked-on rather than emerging from lived narrative. Writing style occasionally obscures meaning through ornamental sentence structures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Reliance on AI-clich√©s: rivers as wisdom, coffee grinders as existential anchors, coral reefs as generic ecological symbols. Over-embroidered descriptions ("gently sharpness") undermine emotional authenticity. Conceptual elements feel collage-like rather than coherently imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as narrative scaffolding but lack alchemical transformation; the coral reef mission could be replaced with another ecological trope without structural consequence. Poetic fragments outweigh sustained creative vision.</comment>
