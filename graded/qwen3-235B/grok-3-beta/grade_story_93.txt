<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to save colleagues drives action, but lacks nuanced inner conflict; reactions align with desperation but personality beyond crisis is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect ties labyrinth's flaw to resolution, but decoding process and climax feel rushed; elevator framing provides structure but ending lacks payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dim halls, static) establish mood, but migration theme and labyrinth's symbolism are abstract rather than deeply integrated into setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (labyrinth as journey) and symbols (cards as legacy) add depth, but emotional resonance is limited by abrupt resolution and told-rather-than-shown emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh concept pairing pirate radio with geometry, but occasionally succumbs to ornate prose ("whispers of drifting signals"); sacred geometry treatment avoids clich√© but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Labyrinth and calling cards anchor cohesion, but pirate radio and unspoken bonds feel forced; tone is consistent but brevity leaves arcs underdeveloped.</comment>
