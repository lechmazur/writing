<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually linked to their assigned traits but remain archetypal; emotional depth is hinted at but underdeveloped through insufficiently nuanced interactions and motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent with satisfying circularity (torn calendar → new page) but feels compressed; some emotional beats are sacrificed for structural conciseness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (creaking looms, salt-infused cynicism) establish mood but lack integration with character psychology beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance ("broken beauty") and lyrical metaphors elevate impact; emotional undercurrents could be more viscerally shown through specific character actions rather than abstract reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into poetic generalizations ("storm of cynicism") rather than distinctively human moments; writing style is purposeful but occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere minimally; central themes are present but execution lacks layered complexity required for prestige-tier publication, feeling more conceptually ambitious than fully realized.</comment>
