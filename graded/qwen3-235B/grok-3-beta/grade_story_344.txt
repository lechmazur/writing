<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maris's claustrophobia drives her external journey but internal conflict remains abstract; her wire-rimmed glasses as a talisman symbolically connect to her mentor's influence, though the "lightly heavyhearted" trait lacks visceral manifestation through consistent behavioral cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Non-linear progression prioritizes thematic resonance over tight plot mechanics; the jam-tasting ritual functions as both action and symbolic pivot, though the transition from trauma to healing feels slightly compressed within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moss-covered tea house's tactile, olfactory details immerse readers in its impossible reality; temperature contrasts—steam fogging glasses, "damp salt" memories—anchor the eerie atmosphere in bodily experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (jam recipes as inherited resilience, floating cradle vs. cage) carry emotional weight, though reliance on "quietly bold" descriptors occasionally leans into poetic abstraction over concrete revelation of theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through specificity of invented elements (tide-pool eyes, cavern-panic memories); some abstract phrasing ("unseen depths," "frayed courage") edges toward poetical overprecision rather than organic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrate synergistically to explore healing-as-acceptance, though the story's brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of secondary patrons' narratives that could amplify thematic weight.</comment>
