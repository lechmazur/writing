<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation to stand by the unremembered aligns with actions, but lacks complexity beyond poetic melancholy. Quiet intensity is present but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear arc from discovery to vow, but pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle. Plot hinges logically on cryptic seal/wax unraveling, though ending resolution is abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: ivy, rusted tracks, and sundial create tactile decay. Sensory details (cold metal, rustling ivy) immerse reader. Setting as graveyard of forgotten journeys enhances theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (sundial, "delicate undoing") and subtext of resurrecting forgotten voices are evocative. Ending feels emotionally resonant if slightly overstated. Theme of defiance through art is consistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some flowery phrasing ("quietly intense soul") veers into purple prose. Avoids major tropes by focusing on specificity of the poetâ€™s mission, but emotional nuance occasionally stated overtly ("he wept").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements integrate cohesively to serve theme. Writing feels purposefully concise, leaving lingering reflection on memory and erasure. Style occasionally overwrought but generally impactful.</comment>
