<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character shows consistent motivation and voice, but inner conflict lacks nuanced psychological depth; external actions align with traits but inner reasoning feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression but relies heavily on symbolic momentum; cause-effect between object and action is abstract yet coherent within the mystical framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting creates immersive, multisensory atmosphere; geode's iridescence and book scent are vividly integrated with character psychology and narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegant metaphorical layering (runes as manuscript, skepticism as tool); ending delivers thematic resonance though emotional impact could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; occasionally leans on ornate descriptors but subverts expectations through paradoxical tone (brazen humility) and unique sensory pairings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve the story's core tension and theme; feels intentionally compact with lingering philosophical questions that elevate its brevity.</comment>
