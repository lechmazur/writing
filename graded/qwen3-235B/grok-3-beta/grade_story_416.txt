<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (rebellious scholarship, quest for legends) are clear but underdeveloped; Aldric's straight-laced demeanor feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed but coherent; the collision-as-inciting-incident works, though the championship reset framing lacks payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luminous swamp vividly rendered with sensory details but its connection to the championship timeframe and "urban legends" feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "humming shell") hint at deeper themes, but the knight-scholar dynamic lacks emotional complexity; dialogue functional but flat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in premise (rebellious knight) but relies on predictable collision trope; prose occasionally ornate but not consistently purple.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combined competently but not transcendentally; the ending feels incomplete rather than deliberate, undermining cohesion.</comment>
