<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually cohesive but lacks emotional depth and nuanced internal conflict; motivations are clear but not deeply explored within constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot is logically structured with clear progression, but the abrupt resolution and limited stakes dilute narrative urgency within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric contrasts (cosmic vs. terrestrial) create immersive cohesion, though some elements (e.g., holographic snow) strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, layered metaphors (strategy as cosmic harmony), and thematic resonance elevate the narrative beyond its concise form, though subtext could deepen further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Highly original premise avoids clich√©s; imagery (zero-gravity bees, starlight honey) feels inventive without veering into pretentiousness or mechanical repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements cohesively, though brevity occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over emotional payoff; ending lingers thematically but feels slightly unresolved.</comment>
