<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; zealotry feels abstract rather than viscerally demonstrated through specific choices or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through the action of opening capsules, but the tight word limit undermines the sense of transformation; climax feels abrupt despite functional cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative cosmic imagery and materially spiritual setting details create immersive atmosphere, though the connection between "cloud watching" and interstellar context remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story successfully blends metaphor with action, but emotional impact relies heavily on abstract concepts ("revolution") rather than character-specific stakes or tangible consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasionally clich√©d phrasing ("whispered legends," "silent revolution") and overly ornate descriptions that prioritize style over narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates assigned elements but feels constrained by their sheer number; thematic threads suggest depth that word limits prevent fully realizing.</comment>
