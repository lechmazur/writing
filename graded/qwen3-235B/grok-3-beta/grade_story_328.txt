<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Assigned traits (meekness/assertiveness) underdeveloped through action; motivation for escape clear but lack of interiority weakens emotional investment; reactions to greeting card and technology underutilized to reveal complexity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear but static progression; firework timeframe creates urgency but fails to structurally bind beginning/middle/end; technology’s integration strains suspension of disbelief; pacing uneven with repetitive imagery</comment>
