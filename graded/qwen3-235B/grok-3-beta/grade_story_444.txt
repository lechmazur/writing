<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through conflict or evolution. Traits like "fierce" feel performative, not earned through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative lacks concrete progression; abstract concept replaces plot. End feels like arbitrary terminus rather than culmination. Cause-effect logic is obscured by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Zeppelin's atmosphere masterfully rendered through synesthetic details (static-as-time, algae glow). Sensory immersion achieves mythic decay, making setting itself a haunting character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery but emotional engagement remains elusive. Theme is declarative rather than organically revealed. Metaphoral density obscures human core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Reliance on grandiose abstractions ("quiet inferno", "chain of letters") borders on self-parody. Tropes like "cathedral of dreams" feel algorithmically assembled rather than authentically imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overwritten surface dazzles but underlying narrative architecture collapses under scrutiny. Ambition exceeds execution; more poetic exercise than functional story.</comment>
