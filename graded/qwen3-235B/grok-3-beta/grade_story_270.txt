<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has contradictory traits but lacks emotional depth; motivations implied more than demonstrated through specific actions or choices within the constraints of the form.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but pacing feels uneven; the story's brevity compresses key developments (like Elias's realization) into moments that require more emotional or contextual buildup for full impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (candlelight, smell of salt) effectively create atmosphere; however, some elements (like the lighthouse's history) remain underutilized in contributing to plot or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor elevate the narrative; emotional resonance is present but occasionally undercut by overreliance on abstract descriptors ("quiet ache") rather than concrete psychological insight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids complete formulaicity but contains moments of overwritten phrasing; the concept of "ephemeral" and "shared isolation" is explored creatively, though some descriptions veer toward purple prose ("the echo pulsed, a voice of shared loneliness").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements are competently integrated but lack transformative synergy; the story works within its constraints but doesn't transcend them to create something urgently distinctive.</comment>
