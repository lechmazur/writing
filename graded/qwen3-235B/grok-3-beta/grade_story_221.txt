<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Mara's familial conflict and connection to the ghost feel superficial, lacking psychological depth to fully justify her emotional decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed, sacrificing nuanced progression; cause-effect between Mara's actions and the ghost's resolution works, but the rapid redemption lacks incremental emotional buildup needed for full resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory specifics (rusted tin ducks, amber's pulse) that merge decay and haunting beauty, though the carnival's history occasionally leans on generic melancholic tropes rather than distinctive historical texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolic cohesion (amber as trapped emotion, reenactment as catharsis) elevates thematic depth; ending resonates with emotional irony, though subtext about storytelling legacies could be more explicitly woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (carnival ghosts, familial shadows) through precise metaphors, but occasionally slips into familiar melancholic phrasing ("laughter and loss") that softens its originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Element integration is seamless and thematically purposeful, but the story’s brevity prevents full exploration of dual character arcs; leaves thematic questions about legacy and connection, yet resolution feels slightly expedited.</comment>
