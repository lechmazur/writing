<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth despite vivid descriptors; motivation to "rescue ancient traditions" drives actions but feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. The "aggressively kind" trait is stated rather than demonstrated through specific behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pivotal action (flinging whistle) creates clear arc but pacing falters under word constraintsâ€”transition from whale's call to intervention lacks narrative breathing room. Plot concept coheres but execution feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haunting sensory details (cracked glass, spectral tension) immerse effectively, but connection between lighthouse and village stage remains superficial. Atmosphere compensates for thin ecological/ritual logic linking sea and tradition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and symbolic weight elevate impact (whistle as conduit, whale as ancient messenger). Ambiguous ending maintains thematic resonance but sacrifices emotional catharsis. Subtext about cultural erosion is potent but under-developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally teeters into purple territory ("spectral tension," "mournful howl"). Aggressively kind spirit feels conceptually forced; whale's call and rituals evoke mythic tones but lack nuanced differentiation from common sea-tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates poetic unity but sacrifices narrative urgency. Length amplifies atmospheric beauty at the expense of character engagement. Lingers thematically but doesn't piercingly haunt.</comment>
