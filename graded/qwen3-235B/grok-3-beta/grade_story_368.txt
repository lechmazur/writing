<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's "streetwise" nature is superficially contrasted with his choice to stay but lacks deeper socioeconomic context or psychological nuance. Motivation to "harvest hope" feels abstract rather than visceral, weakening emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure (entry-temple exploration-departure) but relies on vague "unwritten calendar" revelations. Causal links between reversed patterns, brooch pulses, and hidden grove remain underdeveloped despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through luminous decay imagery and liminal timelessness, but sensory details are unevenâ€”vine textures and fruit flavors dominate while soundscape (echoes) feels underutilized for immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "fruit of pure light") create memorable symbolic resonance, but the ending's "vowed to return" lacks concrete follow-through. Themes of hope's cost remain suggestive rather than fully embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While avoiding major tropes, phrasing like "scarred, determined heart" veers into melodrama. Brooch's "weight like guilt" offers fresh materiality, but inconsistent tone shifts (mystical/pedestrian) undermine stylistic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than formulaic fare, but the unwritten calendar and reversed patterns function as decorative mysticism rather than integral narrative mechanisms. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution depth.</comment>
