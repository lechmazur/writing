<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivations (spinelessness vs. necessity) are conceptually clear but underdeveloped. Growth feels rushed despite thematic alignment. Emotional conflict lacks nuanced internal/external duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure (storm→mentor→projector→resolution) is coherent but strained by word count. Key revelations (hidden panel, projector function) feel abrupt, weakening cause-effect logic and pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (gaslight, ancient globes, creaking panel) immerse effectively, but setting-timeframe synergy (hush after storm) remains superficial. Sensory descriptions border on ornamental rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "luminous doubt," "uncharted horizons") and the map-as-fear motif offer layered meaning. Ending transcends sentimentality, but subtext is occasionally undercut by exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some tropes (wise mentor, stormbound chamber) are cliched, while "grandly trivial" filigree and dollhouse key blend ingenuity with slight awkwardness. Inner conflict shows human nuance, but overly baroque phrasing risks "purple prose."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified arc but strain under tight constraints. The brevity accentuates key moments (mentor’s entrance, map’s revelation) while sacrificing deeper exploration of concept-character symbiosis.</comment>
