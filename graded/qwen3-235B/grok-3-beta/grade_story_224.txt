<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape mundanity drives the plot but 'openly private' trait isn't fully integrated into actions beyond veiled lyrics; the reaction to the ladle feels psychologically thin despite atmospheric melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rejuvenation through meteorite/ladle propulsion is conceptually coherent but abrupt; the cosmic catalyst feels undermotivated within the worldbuilding, and the climactic transformation lacks intermediary tension despite effective pacing and arc completion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Giants' dining room's cavernous shadows and rush hour's contrast create vivid sensory juxtaposition; the meteorite's tactile symbolism and ladle's runes are meaningfully embedded in the atmosphere of stagnation and rebirth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'map of cosmic journeys' add depth but occasionally verge on pretension; rejuvenation's emotional resonance is mixed between effective 'showing' (trembling fingers) and stated feelings (gentle turmoil's explicitness).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but has moments of genre predictability; tactile rejuvenation method feels inventive, yet some phrases ('gentle turmoil') drift toward poetic abstraction without earning it through subtext or nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but with uneven emotional weight; the meteorite/ladle interaction lacks narrative inevitability, while the rush hour/tone contrast and rebirth theme offer lingering thematic potential constrained by brevity.</comment>
