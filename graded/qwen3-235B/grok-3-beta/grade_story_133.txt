<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character motivations (preserving hunting methods, confronting legacy) are clear but the transformation from cynic to resolve-hunter feels underdeveloped despite strong core concept. The gloves as tangible connection to lineage work well.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies on condensed exposition about the throne and hunting methods. Pacing of Elias’s shift from isolation to action is abrupt, though the final image ties back to the opening’s labyrinth motif effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is gorgeously rendered with sensory details (twilight colors, clay textures) but the colonial rooftops and orchard’s relevance to themes of unclaimed heritage remain atmospheric rather than integrally functional to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (gloves as maps, labyrinth as turmoil) and subtext about eroded traditions. Ending avoids neat resolution, leaving tension between preservation and reclamation. Some over-explaining of the throne concept dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The interplay of "demure audacity" and "delightfully menacing" creates compelling tension between characters. Occasional purple prose (e.g., "paintbrushes of sunset") and slightly mechanical turns of phrase ("dared him to reclaim what was lost") undercut naturalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story coalesces around legacy themes but some elements (e.g., throne significance, pottery class) feel more symbolic than organic. Lyrical prose and emotional resonance offset minor structural and contextual thinness in execution.</comment>
