<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Development is introspective but lacks behavioral specificity; motivation is thematic rather than action-driven. Voice feels overstylized rather than authentic despite strong emotional intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Internal journey dominates external plot; coherence exists through metaphor rather than action logic. Pacing alternates between poetic rumination and abrupt resolution within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory immersion is visceral and layered, though mechanical animals’ symbolic purpose outpaces functional integration. Atmosphere masterfully mirrors psychological stakes through tangible decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical density creates profound thematic resonance. Shard symbolism, bodily imagery, and crucible metaphor coalesce into multidimensional self-reckoning. Ending provides emotional catharsis through linguistic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Imagery risks overelaboration (“map of pain”), yet clockwork metaphor and sculptor framework offer unexpected intersections. Balance between poeticism and narrative clarity occasionally falters through excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structural integrity achieved through thematic repetition rather than traditional plot mechanics. All elements serve existential revelation, though pacing unevenness slightly undermines overall cohesion.</comment>
