<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation tied to past trauma, but depths of nuance and individual voice are thin; internal conflict is implied but not viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot moves purposefully between virtual calls and mirror ritual, but the connection between these threads feels slightly mechanical; the ending provides direction but lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere—the derelict station’s decay, warped mirror, and oppressive silence—are rendered with evocative sensory detail that amplifies the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., "screaming silence," mirror distortions) and layered themes of memory/atonement; the ending resonates as a quiet, determined pivot rather than melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vigilante/redeemer trope is familiar, but the divination-via-mirror twist and focus on emotional aftermath of war show ingenuity; prose occasionally veers into ornate abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently braided into the narrative, but the story’s cohesion is strained by thematic overcrowding (war, redemption, divination) and slight tonal inconsistencies.</comment>
