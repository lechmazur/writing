<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks discernible voice or consistent psychology; motivations rely on abstract concepts rather than grounded reasoning; actions often seem arbitrarily tied to assigned elements without developing a coherent persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression; the central action of "prove" feels disconnected from character development; circular structure results in stagnant momentum within word constraints; cause-effect relationships obscured by vague cosmic imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere occasionally effective through visceral sensory details (electric sky, skeletal remains) but undermined by over-reliance on clich√©d gothic tropes; setting functions primarily as decorative backdrop rather than organic extension of thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Attempts at poetic profundity undercut by superficial symbolism; some memorable phrases but overall emotional impact diluted by opaque themes; ending fails to resolve tension between "mirage" and reality; excessive abstraction hinders narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Abundance of generic descriptors, repetitive adverbial phrasing, and artificially convoluted metaphors ("bruised and electric sky") suggest algorithmic stylistic defaults; narrative logic follows predictable AI pattern rather than organic storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Element inclusions feel mechanically imposed; stylized prose prioritizes ornamental complexity over functional storytelling; brief length doesn't serve as artistic choice but exposes narrative fragility; fails to cohere into meaningful thematic whole.</comment>
