<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually defined but lacks emotional depth and evolving reactions; motivations are stated but not organically explored through nuanced choices or consequences in action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot exists as static mood rather than progression; tension between digital and analog is atmospheric but lacks rising action, resolution, or structural momentum within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through juxtaposition of decayed circus imagery and digital dystopia; sensory details (shadow-play, tactile decay) amplify thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overly stylized prose ("hauntingly bright," "feral elegance") veers into self-parody; relies on dystopian tropes without subversion; coded lullabies feel arbitrarily appended rather than naturally integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cohesive as mood piece but lacks narrative ambition; elements service style over substance, leaving intellectual/emotional resonance underdeveloped despite technical competence.</comment>
