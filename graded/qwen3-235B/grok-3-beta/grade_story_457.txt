<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character development is present but surface-level; motivations tied to rebellion feel stated rather than deeply explored through nuanced actions or consequences. The zipper pull's symbolic weight is overstated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with clear progression, but compressed arc feels rushed; the resistance's emergence lacks concrete examples despite atmospheric foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting's cosmic atmosphere and sensory details immerse readers; nebula observation deck's visual descriptions directly enhance the theme of constrained freedom.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphors (zipper, nebula) and subtext about hypocrisy; ending feels poignant but slightly didactic, leaning on symbolism more than earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through unique cosmic setting, but "absurd solemnity" and some descriptors (e.g., "cosmic joke") veer toward pretentiousness. Propagation via folklore risks intellectual abstraction over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Elements cohere into a thematic whole, though pacing feels pressured by word limit; the story's metaphorical ambition transcends its brevity without becoming overly schematic.</grade>
