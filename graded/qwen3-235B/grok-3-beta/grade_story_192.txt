<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear and thematically consistent, but complexity remains surface-level. Reactions to the sewing box reveal longing, yet deeper psychological nuances are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from discovery to resolution, but pacing feels rushed in key transitions. The action of cleaning drives momentum, though the integration of poltergeist clues lacks organic causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting's fusion of ancient and modern tech is vivid, with strong sensory detail in contrasts (mosaic dust vs. holograms). Atmosphere underscores theme of fragmentation but could deepen immersion through more tactile descriptions of the "technically organic."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (stitching as connection) and subtext about memory in the digital era. Ending delivers emotional resonance, though some phrasing veers into poetic abstraction, diluting the rawness of Marcus's struggle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the premise but stumbles into familiar tropes (lonely protagonist, tragic ghost seamstress). Avoids overt purple prose, yet some phrases ("whispers forming words in Latin") feel overly curated rather than emotionally lived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by the density of assigned elements, occasionally sacrificing narrative flow. Lingering emotional impact is anchored in the universal theme of connection, but execution lacks the polish needed for top-tier distinction.</comment>
