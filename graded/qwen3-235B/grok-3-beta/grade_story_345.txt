<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's traits as a lapsed priest shape his internal struggle, but motivations lack sufficient psychological complexity; determination to defy fate feels underexplored despite symbolic use of the abacus.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory from labyrinth to clearing, but pacing is uneven: introspection slows momentum, and the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually vivid setting with bean stalks as oppressive metaphors, but inconsistent sensory texture—cold air and frost emphasized, other senses neglected, weakening full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (abacus as lost clarity, snow patterns as fragile hope) enrich the narrative; ending balances emotional resonance and thematic purpose without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors (bean stalks as "judgmental titans"), but phrases like "radiant maze" border on cliché; emotional states occasionally stated rather than shown, suggesting slight artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't fully integrated—the orchard's surrealism and jogging as action feel somewhat disconnected, yet the defiant redemption arc lingers as a cohesive idea.</comment>
