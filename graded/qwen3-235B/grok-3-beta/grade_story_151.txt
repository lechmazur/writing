<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Limited internal conflict; motivations tied to abstract ideals outweigh relatable human traits, weakening emotional resonance despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragmented momentum; snowflake cultivation lacks concrete stakes until climax, while the idol's destruction feels rushed despite thematic symmetry between fractal patterns and systemic collapse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vividly realized setting details (crystal shadows, ice floes) create haunting atmosphere, but underdeveloped temporal implications of "last human emotion" leave existential tone feeling superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., veil as both burden and legacy) elevate thematic density; ending sacrifices raw emotional consequence for aesthetic resolution, slightly undermining the conceptual ambition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lyrical excess distracts from narrative economy; repetitive motif-driven phrasing ("rationally organic") and overdetermined symbolism verge on self-parody, while character psychology remains enigmatic rather than complex.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Successful tonal cohesion in blending existential bleakness and fragile hope, but overreliance on abstract symbolism risks hollow thematic gestures rather than earned narrative weight.</comment>
