<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and anger-driven actions, but lacks psychological complexity; reactions to ancestral voices are predictable but consistently tied to his irate nature</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compact structure with coherent progression from confrontation to temporary resolution; overcomes word limit constraints with clear beginning/middle/end progression but suffers slightly from rushed meditation transition</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vividly rendered setting through specific sensory details (dust motes, creaking floorboards); atmosphere perfectly complements themes of stagnation and ancestral haunting, though bedroom analogy feels slightly contrived</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent symbolism in heartbeat/pulse motif creates emotional resonance; ending balances triumph and lingering tension effectively; could explore thematic subtleties more deeply</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through specific imagery choices (e.g., "hush of a childhood bedroom left forever") but occasionally relies on expected tropes about ancestral hauntings; voice maintains consistent tone without becoming derivative</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven rather than compartmentalized; creates lingering impression of unresolved generational trauma; prose maintains quality throughout despite minor formulaic undertones</comment>
