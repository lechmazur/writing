<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Maris’ skepticism and fixation on tactile artifacts align clearly with his task, but his internal conflict lacks psychological nuance; motivations are consistent yet underexplored beyond plot necessities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression through thimble categorization is logical but compressed; the storm climax feels abrupt despite symbolic buildup. Connections between beginning/end are thematic but structurally sparse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Star chart room’s eerie atmosphere merges with tactile decay (dented thimbles, dying holograms) to evoke existential loss. Sensory details immerse but occasionally verge on overwrought metaphors (e.g., “loud silence”).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (thimbles as grief maps, storms as residual humanity) and lyrical imagery elevate the narrative. Subtext on digitization’s emotional sterility lingers, though some metaphors lack refinement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but treads familiar speculative ground (post-human nostalgia). Overreliance on abstract descriptors (“mysterious partings,” “oppressive quiet”) risks vagueness; rideshare lines feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly: thimbles and storms work symbiotically, while rideshare snippets and star patterns strain plausibility. Premise is bold, execution occasionally prioritizes style over emotional resonance.</comment>
