<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits influence actions thematically but lack depth in evolving motivation; connection between spiritual tracking and plot feels underexplored</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect relationships are logical yet overly condensed, weakening emotional buildup to the resolution</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesively woven but feel somewhat checklist-driven; the compressed length sacrifices narrative momentum and thematic depth, though the metaphorical framework lingers</comment>
