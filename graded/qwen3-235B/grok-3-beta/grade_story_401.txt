<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level; his wilderness background informs his resilience but doesn't fully integrate with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc exists within word limit but progression feels slightly rushed; decoding the blanket drives progression logically but lacks nuanced steps between emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid with sensory details (seaweed, coffee, rust) but atmospheric elements occasionally overshadow thematic cohesion; decay mirrors internal state effectively but sometimes feels heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (ring, blanket) and thematic resonance ("healing as skill") create memorable impact; ending delivers emotional catharsis although some internal monologue leans toward tell-over-show.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (encoded blanket, underwater mourning) but tone occasionally veers toward melodrama; metaphors feel purposeful but occasional over-reliance on abstract phrases dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere reasonably but reliance on Gothic tropes (haunted ship, solitary mourner) feels somewhat familiar; thematic ambition and tactile code idea elevate beyond formulaic structure.</comment>
