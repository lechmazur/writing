<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters serve as poetic symbols rather than fully realized people; Hana's motives rely on atmospheric implication rather than emotional depth or tangible backstory, making her ethereal but detached from psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows an arc of symbolic gestures but lacks tangible stakes; cause-effect progressions around meteor interpretations feel abstract, and the word count limits emotional payoff despite atmospheric cohesion between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting seamlessly merges ancient and modern, with sensory details (moats, lanterns, storm clouds) enhancing tone; the castle-as-bridge metaphor is effective, though deeper integration of environment with plot progression is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celestial and floral symbolism is evocative, but emotional beats often rely on poetic abstraction rather than earned dramatic moments; the ending lingers thematically but lacks visceral resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in blending astral observation with botanical artistry, but "storm-cloud eyes" and "samurai ghosts" verge on trope. Prose avoids purple patches but occasionally favors lyricism over narrative precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story works as mood-piece but sacrifices narrative momentum for atmosphere; elements are cohesive yet lightly deployed, leaving thematic resonance without structural innovation.</comment>
