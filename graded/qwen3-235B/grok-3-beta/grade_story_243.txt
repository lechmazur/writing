<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Zephyr’s "jumpiness" is superficially displayed through twitches and faltering, but his motivation to unmask ByteKnight feels more plot-driven than psychologically nuanced. His "bizarre" methods lack depth beyond quirkiness, weakening character complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The central action (piercing the mural) drives the plot but pacing feels rushed; the sudden appearance of enforcers and resolution lacks buildup. Cause/effect relationships hinge on arbitrary game logic rather than narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid 8-bit imagery (neon skies, chiptune caves) creates strong atmosphere. Some sensory details (e.g., tactile feedback of crumbling walls) are missing, limiting full immersion despite evocative visual language.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Themes of myth vs. reality are clear but surface-level allegory. Metaphors (fishhook as truth-revealer) are effective but underdeveloped. The ending resolves plot but not thematic tension, leaving subtext unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of necromancy and glitchpunk tropes avoids clichés. Avoids overused similes but relies on familiar rebellion arcs. Emotional nuance in Zephyr’s fear is shown through physicality, not abstract introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements (fishhook, mural, retro setting) tie together logically but lack thematic synergy. Brevity feels imposed rather than purposeful; lingering questions about the "sleeping gods" suggest underused potential for deeper commentary.</comment>
