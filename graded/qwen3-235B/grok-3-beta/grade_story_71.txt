<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Rushed internal conflict undermines motivation; straw heart's apathy contradicts decisive action without sufficient catalyst. The oath's weight feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically developed through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Parallel world stakes introduced late; virtual reality sequences compress character development unnaturally. Resolution feels abrupt, lacking causal progression between oath and decisive skewering action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Petrified time atmosphere masterfully conveyed through stone bones and glowing grooves. Sensory dissonance between tactile burlap descriptions and digital static creates haunting dichotomy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical lines as bridges resonate, but emotional payoff diluted by protagonist's affectless narration. Ending's contemplative silence works thematically but sacrifices cathartic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Parallel worlds trope remains under-interrogated; "ghostly figure" and "digital static" verge on clich√©. Virtual reality framing device employs repetitive "petrified time" phrasing and explicitly stated emotions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't synergize: fossilized giant becomes symbolic wallpaper. Virtual reality intrusions feel algorithmically generated rather than narratively essential. Lingering questions about apathy vs. duty hint at deeper potential.</comment>
