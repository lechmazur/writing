<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations feel poetic but underexplored; Veyra's internal conflict is hinted at but lacks the emotional weight needed to fully justify her pivotal decision.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but is constrained by overwritten metaphors that occasionally muddy pacing; the arc is clear but resolution feels slightly rushed without sufficient buildup to the climactic choice.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details construct an immersive alien grandeur, but the baroque descriptions occasionally tip into excess, making the setting feel more abstract than tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (camera lens/sunrise/spiderweb) elevates thematic depth; the twist away from violence resonates emotionally, though some imagery risks overshadowing narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linguistic flourishes occasionally border on self-indulgent; while metaphors feel fresh, the prose’s density could suggest algorithmic layering rather than organic emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Element integration is ambitious but uneven; the story’s lyrical tone carries it despite narrative gaps, though tighter cohesion between concept and execution would strengthen publishability.</comment>
