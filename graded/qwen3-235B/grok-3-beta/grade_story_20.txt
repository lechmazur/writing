<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to chronicle social movements is clear but underdeveloped; her transformation feels schematic. Internal conflict hinted at but lacks visceral depth or specific backstory explaining her disillusionment as an archer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear structure exists but feels compressed. The bridge encounter lacks buildup, and the resolution is overly abrupt. Celestial elements disrupt cohesion rather than enhance it, creating tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (e.g., roaring inverted waterfall) create haunting immersion, but the celestial timeframe feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically tied to the bridge's symbolism or Elara's arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (comb as inherited regret, bridge as unchosen paths) add thematic resonance. Ending feels intellectually satisfying but emotionally muted; character growth is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually inventive but leans on faux-profound descriptors ("passionate disinterest") and predictable supernatural tropes. The ghost doppelg√§nger twist feels derivative rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Aesthetic cohesion exists, but conceptual rigor falters: many elements (celestial dance, roadside attraction) feel checklist-driven rather than emergent from character or theme. Lingering emotional impact minimal.</comment>
