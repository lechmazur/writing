<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation tied to cosmic powers and ritual is clear but lacks psychological depth; "academically wild" is mentioned but unexplored, weakening character nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from conflict to release cohesively, but the word limit creates rushed transitions between Mara’s past doubts and present action; ritual’s significance feels abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Gargoyles and abyss create a mythic, melancholic atmosphere; sensory details (cosmic sparks, warmth of the brooch) enhance immersion but underdeveloped factory-world contrast weakens thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (abyss as doubt, "ordered disarray") and symbolic objects enhance thematic resonance, but emotional impact is muted by abstract introspection over visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar "rebellion against conformity" tropes; cosmic powers and ritual feel fresh in concept but are rendered with overly ornate language that occasionally veers into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements work in concert despite the constraints; the story’s brevity feels deliberate, though a more complex exploration of identity beneath societal expectations would add depth.</comment>
