<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional character development or arc, but offers nuanced portrayal of a static, introspective figure. Motivation is clear but unchallenged, making it more of a mood piece than dynamic character study.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Static plot with no progression or resolution; coherence maintained through atmosphere over plot mechanics. Assigned action (folding) loops without narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceedingly vivid sensory details create an immersive, haunting world. Timelessness and mist enhance tone. Slight deductions for being overly descriptive at times.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and subtext about impermanence elevate storytelling. Lacks emotional resonance due to static character and plot. Memorable for poetic atmosphere rather than narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh subversions of tropes. Some phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction, but generally avoids clich√©s. Nuanced handling of obsessions and liminal space between reality/imagination.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion (e.g., origami as failed mapping mirrors consciousness flows). Brief length works for meditative tone. Lacks narrative urgency despite lyrical strengths.</comment>
