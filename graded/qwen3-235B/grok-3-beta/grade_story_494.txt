<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits like arrogance and "doubtfully confident" are visually expressed but lack internal nuance; motivation to unshackle potential is clear but underdeveloped thematically. The song method reveals vulnerability but feels contrived as swordsman behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from curse to resolution, but song-driven transformation lacks emotional buildup; beginning/end cohesion strong, pacing uneven due to compressed epiphany. Core concept shapes structure but resolution feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (ink/stone) establish mood; atmosphere enhances theme. Calligraphy setting's symbolic connection to "binding" is clever but underexplored. Harsh tenderness tone shines through contrasting imagery and dialogue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (tapestry chains, dying light) and subtext about fear vs. arrogance resonate emotionally. Ending transcends cliché by linking personal growth to collective hope. Writing style balances poetic prose with narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional pairing of calligraphy master with swordsman. Some clichéd phrases ("weight of her words") but metaphors like "blade as stolen dawn" feel original. Emotional beats shown through action, though epiphany borders on melodrama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate more organically than typical constraints; brevity serves meditative themes. Lingering impact comes from universal theme of overcoming self-doubt masked as arrogance, elevated by visceral imagery and symbolic coherence.</comment>
