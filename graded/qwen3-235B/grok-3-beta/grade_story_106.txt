<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is emotionally resonant but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond surface-level angst; motivation to escape failure is clear but slightly oversimplified.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive but relies on passive emotional progression; pivotal action (quilting stamps) drives the narrative effectively within the word limit, though transitions are occasionally abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the submerged setting; atmosphere amplifies themes of decay and defiance, though the underwater element feels underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses potent symbolism (quilt as map/sail) and explores resilience, but relies on somewhat familiar metaphors; ending resonates but lacks unexpected depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose occasionally veers into ornate description; avoids overt tropes but lacks subversive ingenuity; emotional states are shown but occasionally undercut by overtelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a thematically cohesive narrative, though some (e.g., underwater setting) contribute less to plot momentum; concept execution feels deliberate but not revelatory.</comment>
