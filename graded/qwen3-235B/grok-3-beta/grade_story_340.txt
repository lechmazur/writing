<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Feisty sarcasm well-voiced but mentor rivalry feels underexplored; motivation to outshine legacy lacks emotional depth despite clear thematic intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rapid resolution of path closure via vertical movement feels contrived; spellcasting climax coherent but temporal skips underutilized in tight structure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into functional narrative, but some feel checklist-driven (time hiccup) rather than organically integrated into concise character drama.</comment>
