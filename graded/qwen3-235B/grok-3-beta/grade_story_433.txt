<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness and brokenness are evident but underexplored; motivation is clear but interiority lacks depth. Actions align with traits but feel more reactive than driven by nuanced choices. Voice leans poetic but doesn't fully individualize Eamon's perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from discovery to quest, but the compressed arc feels rushed. Cause-effect between prophecy scraps and decisions is established but lacks layered stakes. Pacing prioritizes momentum over emotional weight; beginning/end connection is functional but not resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery with snow sculptures creates vivid, thematically relevant atmosphere. Frostbite sensory details and transient art metaphorically mirror character themes. Snow days setting enhances mood but underutilizes temporal constraints. Environmental elements don't fully integrate with plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "whispering pages," melting hope metaphors) elevates prose. Subtext about impermanence resonates through setting-character parallels. Ending leaves thematic questions unresolved intentionally but risks ambiguity over poignancy. Emotional beats told more than shown; tension between desperation and audacity could deepen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Writing leans on poetic abstraction ("fleeting hope," "fierce embrace") that occasionally veers into purple prose. Tropes (broken traveler, prophetic quest) remain largely unchallenged. Character psychology simplifies obsession as defiance without exploring contradictions. Sensory details effective but unevenly distributed; atmospheric momentum slows during exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around impermanence theme but unevenly advance plot. Prophecy method and setting could integrate more organically. Prose quality and thematic underpinnings suggest potential, but narrative scope feels constrained by brevity rather than purposefully distilled. Lingers in atmosphere more than emotional impact.</comment>
