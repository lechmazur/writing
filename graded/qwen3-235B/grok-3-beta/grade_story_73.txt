<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character exhibits consistency between 'steadiness', 'whimsical diligence', and preservation motivation, but lacks internal conflict or emotional depth to elevate beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear hero's journey arc within constraints, though the transition from discovery to ritual feels slightly rushed despite effective cause-effect of wind guidance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the Aztec-reimagined temple creates profound atmosphere, where 'raucous silence' and material details (obsidian, jade) deeply intertwine with both setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism (veil of worlds, ritual as stitching) resonate thematically; ending achieves satisfying closure while leaving room for mythic mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blends originality (kindrelize, glyph-magnifying glass) with familiar tropes (guardian-of-balance); avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate description over nuanced emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a mythic whole despite word constraints; the tight focus on ritual preservation provides thematic unity, though some connections feel slightly schematic.</comment>
