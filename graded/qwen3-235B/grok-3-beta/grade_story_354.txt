<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Attribute of daring compassion is clear but thinly actualized; character's ethereal nature informs passivity more than actions; teddy bear interaction suggests depth but remains symbolic rather than psychologically layered; voice lacks distinctiveness despite narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aurora chase drives plot but pacing feels truncated; ricochet resolves tension too neatly; cosmic disclaimers lack narrative integration; cause-effect ties to setting are logical but teleological; concise structure sacrifices emotional momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Virtual reality archive is vividly rendered with sensory-rich metaphors; "elegant chaos" tone aligns with thematic dissonance but risks overwhelming narrative; some descriptions verge on ornamental rather than meaningfully atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (teddy bear as burden, auroras as healing) resonates; emotional impact is muted by abstract character portrayal; ending sacrifices emotional weight for thematic neatness; subtext of sacrifice is compelling but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept-layering (wizard in VR), but cosmic disclaimers/ricochet borrow heavily from sci-fi tropes; metaphors occasionally veer into overused territory ("celestial choirs"); emotional beats prioritize abstraction over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; setting dominates at story's expense; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; aesthetic ambition outpaces emotional or narrative memorability.</comment>
