<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's serenity feels inconsistently applied; motivation for seeking texts lacks layered psychological nuance, though the wristband's symbolic unraveling aligns with internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent arc within constraints, but pacing strains credibility—transition from exploration to revelation feels rushed; cause-effect between quilt unraveling and greenhouse's "hum" lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid botanical gothic atmosphere with strong sensory details (cradled flora, petrified blooms), though the lullaby-end timeframe metaphor remains underexploited thematically; greenhouse's "absurd energy" needs clearer integration with illusion concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and central metaphor of unraveling as illusion-mastery enhance the theme; however, the "wisdom woven into cloth" conceit strains suspension of disbelief despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strikes a balance between evocative originality (illusory-extinct ecosystem) and formulaic elements (quilt-as-ancient-map trope); some overwritten passages ("hush once a baby’s lullaby ends") border on pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Element integration is competent but not flawless—wristband and greenhouse strongly anchor the narrative, while the timeframe and "grudging admiration" feel externally imposed rather than organically essential.</comment>
