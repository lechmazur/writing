<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's mechanical arm and philosophical nature are underutilized beyond surface symbolism; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict that would ground his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc (despair to tentative renewal), but pacing falters in transitioning from sock deconstruction to secret revelation, feeling rushed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Abandoned lighthouse vividly mirrors inner decay through visceral imagery; atmospheric integration exceeds functional plot relevance, creating emotional resonance through environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</comment>Strong metaphoric framework (sock as dreams, mechanical failure as doubt) but relies on heavy-handed abstractions; emotional impact diluted by excessive poetic abstraction over human-scale stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conceptual core feels deliberately crafted but strained; sock deconstruction works, while "coded desperation" risks melodrama; occasional purple prose undermines authenticity despite fresh central metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but without revelatory synergy; brevity effectively contains the story but limits thematic complexity; leaves questions rather than lasting resonance.</comment>
