<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to save the moth feels genuine but underexplored; submissive nature contrasts with defiance in a familiar arc. Perceptive trait lacks nuance in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints. Sedative method ties logically to setting, but rescue feels rushed. Arc complete but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ambient details (echoes, glow) build mood, but secret agent workshop clashes awkwardly with aristocrat's gentility, diluting tone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Earnest flippancy" feels imposed; some descriptors strain plausibility. Avoids major clich√©s but contains faintly mechanical phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack deeper synthesis. Constraints handled competently, though brevity prevents full thematic development.</comment>
