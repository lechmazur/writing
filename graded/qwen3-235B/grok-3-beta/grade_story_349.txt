<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is a surface-level blend of cynicism and hope; motivations hinted at but lack depth, inconsistent actions during rushed pairing with Lirien, voice remains generic throughout.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot crams too many elements into tight word count; pivotal events (speed dating, herb spreading) feel contrived; uneven pacing disrupts cause-effect clarity despite a full arc attempted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich details anchor setting (churning sea, cracked domes); atmosphere harmonizes with themes of decay and fragile hope; some object-setting connections feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story aims for emotional weight through metaphor ("mercy's horizon") but struggles to transcend genre trappings; fleeting bond lacks concrete stakes or tangible transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Medieval-fantasy fusion is intriguing but strained by gimmicks (speed dating tropes); lyrical prose occasionally slips into ornate abstraction, while character emotions remain broadly sketched.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but feel compartmentalized; brevity obscures deeper thematic integration; style leans on poetics over clarity, weakening emotional impact.</comment>
