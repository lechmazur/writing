<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivation to preserve humanity's legacy is clear but necromancer identity underexplored. Baseball cap symbolism is effective but solitary in developing character complexity. Behavior aligns with stated goals but inner conflict remains absent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure creates poetic atmosphere at expense of momentum. Arc is implied rather than executed - beginning and end conceptually connected but narrative through-line weakened by lyrical digressions. Concept shapes setting more than action progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystalline cave amplified by multi-sensory details (light refraction, echoing soundscapes) creates immersive paradox of fragile permanence. Timeframe between sets cleverly utilized as ritualistic rhythm rather than restrictive device. Nostalgic holographic projections contrast with dying future atmosphere masterfully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance lies in juxtaposing decaying tech with enduring human connection through art. Metaphors (celluloid cinema/spirit memories) are poignant but occasionally overwritten. Central conflict between preservation and entropy is thematically rich but narratively diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in necromancy-through-cinema is undercut by familiar "last hope" tropes. Language occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("resonant hum of resolve") that reads as forced lyricism rather than authentic voice. Shifts between descriptive lushness and existential gravitas feel uneven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Formal ambition exceeds technical execution in compressed format. Elements cohere thematically more than narratively - emotional payoff feels deserved but structural precision missing. Lingering impression strong, but craftsmanship uneven.</comment>
