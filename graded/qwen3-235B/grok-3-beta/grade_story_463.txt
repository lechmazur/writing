<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marwood’s dry wit and stated motivations are consistent, but his character lacks psychological depth beyond the guarded idealist archetype. His dialogue and actions align with his traits, but the personal stakes in learning traditional methods feel under-explored, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot has clear momentum from the discovery of the rope to the logbook revelation. However, the transition from dancing to finding the hidden drawer feels undercontextualized, and the ending’s ritual solution is abrupt despite the word limit, diluting narrative completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt-stained walls, creaking floorboards) immerse readers in the oppressive atmosphere. The setting enhances the haunting tone, but the haunted lighthouse leans on familiar tropes without fully subverting them to create a uniquely eerie world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (rope as a literal and metaphorical tether) and vivid imagery elevate the narrative. The theme of restoring honor to broken promises is clear, but the resolution’s reliance on ritual feels perfunctory, and dialogue occasionally veers into quippy detachment rather than emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of dance and supernatural discovery subverts genre expectations, avoiding cliché. However, descriptions like “salt-stained walls” and “specters want a fight” border on predictable, and Marwood’s internal logic (e.g., obsession with oaths) occasionally feels overly rationalized without humanizing vulnerability.</comment>

<comment>The story cohesively integrates all assigned elements without feeling forced, though some (e.g., “certainly possible”) are underutilized. The economy of prose suits the word limit, but the ending’s brevity sacrifices thematic weight, leaving the reader intrigued but not fully invested.</comment>
