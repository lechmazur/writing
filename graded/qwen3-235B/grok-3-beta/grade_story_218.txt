<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; Elias's transformation feels abrupt despite strong isolation-to-connection arc. Nuanced emotional reasoning missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure shows clear beginning/end but pacing falters—transition to improv show and resolution rush critical character-realization beats. Cause/effect connections functional but not polished.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (tower decay, sea murmurs) but "during drawing" timeframe inconsistently emphasized. Sensory details immersive but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (game as emotional bridge) deepen theme, but emotional resonance uneven—some feelings "told" vs. "shown." Ending delivers satisfying thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality diluted by familiar tropes (lonely artist, redemption through performance) but elevated by metaphysical elements and unique setting-object interplay. Subtext avoids overt clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds thematically but struggles with tight cohesion; elements feel occasionally forced (improv show, timeframe). Lingering question about solitude vs. connection remains compelling.</comment>
