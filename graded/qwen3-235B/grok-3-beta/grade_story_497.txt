<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character exists more as a symbolic vessel than a rounded individual; motivations are stated rather than organically demonstrated through nuanced choices or conflicting priorities. Action-object relationship lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression from discovery to creation but fails to build tension through meaningful obstacles or emotional stakes within tight constraints. Pacing skims surface of possibilities.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere wastes potential for deeper integration between setting mechanics and character agency; cursed lake's supernatural elements only superficially interact with human-scale themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some evocative symbolism through ice/satellite duality undermined by heavy-handed exposition; emotional payoff diluted by relentless poeticizing without embodied character experience or concrete consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Post-apocalypse tropes receive minimal reworking; repetitive phrasing ("drowned world," "threads of compassion") and occasionally contrived descriptors suggest limited emotional authenticity despite imaginative premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution remains suspended between abstract poetry and narrative substance; thematic intention remains unearned due to underdeveloped emotional throughlines.</comment>
