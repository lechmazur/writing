<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits (unassuming yet burdened) are somewhat clear but lack depth; motivations are consistent yet remain more symbolic than psychologically nuanced, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc (from wandering to resolution), but pacing feels compressed; the puzzle-solving method drives the action effectively, though the ending’s abrupt transition to "sanctuary" lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly atmospheric, blending decay and wonder; sensory details immerse the reader, though the acid rain forest’s thematic connection to the character’s internal struggles occasionally feels overstated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., feather as tactile wisdom) and symbolic imagery bolster thematic depth, but the prose occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over narrative momentum; the ending feels emotionally resonant yet overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in pairing tactile perception with fragmented memory, but overuse of adjectives and abstract phrasing veers into purple prose; emotional beats lean on stated symbolism rather than subtext, hinting at formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven but strain under the weight of their symbolic roles; the story’s brevity works thematically but leaves certain aspects (e.g., the "ember of choice") underexplored; the central metaphor lingers, but execution lacks precision.</comment>
