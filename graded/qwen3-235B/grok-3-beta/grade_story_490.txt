<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is internally consistent but overly stated rather than organically revealed through actions. The paradoxical "enthusiastic apathy" concept is clever but under-explored. Emotional depth remains surface-level despite intriguing setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression but feels compressed, with cause-effect relationships occasionally rushed. Ending provides philosophical resonance but lacks narrative payoff within the tight word limit. Pacing uneven during hacking sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric world-building through sensory details creates vivid post-apocalyptic setting. Salt/oil tang, skeletal caravans, and lavender scent meaningfully ground the reader in Maris's reality. Timeframe's tidal imagery connects effectively to mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Echoing metaphors ("gnarled as driftwood," "galaxy born in her chest") create poetic weight. Ending prompts reflection but lacks sharp thematic focus. Showing rather than telling dominates but occasionally veers into overwrought description.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Some phrases ("whispers outside," "graveyard of caravans") border on clich√©. While structure inventive, elements like "fragments of history" feel formulaic. Voice has individuality but shows traces of AI-style pattern repetition and excessive ornateness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements integrated but not deeply interdependent - story could survive removal of specific details. Brevity serves contemplative tone well but sacrifices narrative depth. The final decision lacks urgent stakes that might make it truly lingering.</comment>
