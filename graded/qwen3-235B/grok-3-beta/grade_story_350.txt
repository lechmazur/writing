<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation (family curse) is present but thinly developed; trait "irritatingly perfect" is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on abstract connections (stamps/gown) without logical cause-effect; abrupt transitions between elements and rushed pacing undermine coherence in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting (ancient temple) and sensory details (oil lamps, musky air, decaying gown) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that deepens the story's tone and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (symphonies of truth, conductor of revelations) add poetic depth, but emotional impact is diluted by underexplored character interiority and an abrupt, underdeveloped resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overly ornate prose and clich√©d tropes (cursed lineage, forbidden love) undercut authenticity; some symbolic connections feel forced rather than organic to the narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Story attempts thematic depth but struggles with cohesion due to uneven integration of assigned elements; atmospheric strength outweighs structural weaknesses.</comment>
