<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like 'unruffled' and 'calloused' establish superficial presence, but motivations feel symbolic rather than psychically grounded; emotional stakes remain abstract despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear symbolic trajectory, but tension and conflict are underdeveloped; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sensory details like 'yellowed pages' and 'stone floors' create vivid setting, but the library's surreal shifting walls lack thematic integration beyond metaphorical color symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "soul singing and weeping") succeed, but the story leans heavily on abstract emotional descriptors rather than embodied subtext; ending achieves thematic circularity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through paradoxical concepts, but some phrases ("whispered secrets") and emotional beats border on formulaic; balance between poetic language and narrative substance remains uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically through color and loss motifs but lack dramatic urgency; brevity sacrifices character depth and contextual richness that could elevate the concept.</comment>
