<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear but unevenly realized; while her role as a "dutiful ward" shapes her actions, her "eagerly jaded" psyche relies more on descriptors than nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters slightly in the logic of stolen phones yielding relevant clues; pacing is tight but some transitions (e.g., sudden voice note revelations) feel rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively crafted with sensory details (dusty velvet, creaking stage), but the "soundless sanctuary" and auditions are loosely integrated, weakening setting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (silence as mortality, laughter as defiance) add depth, though the ending’s emotional resonance leans on vivid description over fully earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some flowery phrasing ("sanctuary’s unnatural quiet") and abrupt tonal shifts undercut originality; while the stolen phone method feels inventive, its plausibility wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story’s tight length is mostly effective, but thematic ambition occasionally outpaces execution; elements like "auditions" feel tacked on rather than purposeful.</comment>
