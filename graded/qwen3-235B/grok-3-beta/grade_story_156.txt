<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's confusion and evolutionary motivation are present but underexplored; internal conflict lacks concrete behavioral embodiment, and the spare key's symbolic role feels forced rather than organically tied to personality. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bus ride structure creates natural progression, with bird observation catalyzing change in approach - but the shift from confusion to policy reform feels rushed; some cause-effect connections need clarification. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid crystalline imagery establishes eerie atmosphere effectively; salt mine setting's resonance with preservation and adaptation enriches themes, though sensory engagement could be deeper - occasional generic descriptions dampen immersion. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolic integration of birds' flight patterns as collective wisdom metaphor works powerfully; writing occasionally veers toward abstraction over dramatic embodiment. Conceptual layer about paradox of connection remains thought-provoking. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("joyfully tragic beauty") and predictable thematic pairings ("boldly timid") suggest artificial construction; evolutionary wisdom concept feels like intellectual overlay rather than organic human insight. Metaphors lack visceral specificity. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elaborate elements create rich tapestry but lack cohesive center; salt mine world is compelling but overwhelms character development. Short form works for contemplative tone but limits narrative impact. </comment>
