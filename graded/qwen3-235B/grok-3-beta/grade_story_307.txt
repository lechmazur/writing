<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters lack distinct voice and interiority beyond archetypal roles; motivation is clear but psychological complexity is minimal, relying on poetic descriptions rather than lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a clean arc despite tight word count, with cause-effect logic intact (DVD → neon → interaction), but resolution feels rushed and lacks stakes beyond symbolic abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting evokes vivid sensory contrast between decay and hope, but atmospheric details occasionally verge on pretentious cliché rather than grounded, emotionally resonant specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose and haunting imagery elevate impact; dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Ends with meaningful ambiguity but struggles to balance poetic abstraction with concrete emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic tropes through hybrid genre elements, but some phrasing ("ethereal grit," "twilight's tender veil") feels contrived. Subtext is clever but occasionally undermines character authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Uses assigned elements cohesively within a thematically driven narrative, though length restricts deeper exploration of ideas. Leaves a lingering impression but lacks visceral, unforgettable punch.</comment>
