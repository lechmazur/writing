<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Underdeveloped psychological nuances and inconsistent emotional stakes weaken the protagonist's tragic fatalism; motivations are stated but lack visceral grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structural symmetry exists but lacks narrative escalation; the circular pattern of nightly rituals offers thematic cohesion without plot progression or tension.</comment>
