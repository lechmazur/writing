<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to uncover lineage ties to celestial navigators is clear, but inner conflicts remain underexplored; her "hollow recklessness" drives action but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to revelation, but the compressed word count leaves some transitions (e.g., attic scavenging to lab synthesis) feeling abrupt despite strong thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., "synthetic hope") and thematic resonance (legacy vs. control) elevate the story, though emotional beats occasionally rely on abstraction over visceral detail.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging biotech with ancestral myth is undermined by occasionally ornate phrasing ("dying leaves," "uncharted skies") that edges toward cliché, though the polaroid-attic conceit is fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and conceptually rich, but the story leans heavily on atmospheric abstraction over narrative urgency; the ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral payoff.</comment>
