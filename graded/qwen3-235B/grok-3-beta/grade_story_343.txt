<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Harlin's melancholy shapes his actions effectively, and his motivation to restore laughter feels urgent but lacks deeper exploration of his internal conflict. The tea leaf method ties to his past, but his voice occasionally feels overly poetic rather than distinctively jester-like.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc fits the word limit well, with clear cause-effect between tea leaf analysis and crew unity. Some compression issues—crew's emotional shift feels slightly rushed despite efficient pacing and logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Brass-and-steam setting creates vivid mechanical contrast to organic themes. Paint drying adds subtle temporal texture. Sensory details (smell of paint, sound of gears) immerse effectively. Atmosphere slightly over-relies on expected steampunk clichés but redeems with unique melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Successfully evokes emotional resonance through symbols (crumpled drawing as hope, tea leaves as human connections). Ending provides satisfying thematic resolution, though character reactions remain broadly sketched. Avoids heavy-handedness with subtext about healing through shared vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original fusion of steampunk and ritual elements subverts genre expectations. Some poetic phrases risk veering into ornate abstraction, but the child's drawing concept and tea leaf geometry feel imaginatively specific. Emotional arcs shown rather than stated, with minimal "telling."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of required elements without apparent strain. The tight length serves the fable-like quality but slightly limits character depth. Lingering philosophical questions about art's purpose and mechanical humanity suggest depth beyond the immediate narrative.</comment>
