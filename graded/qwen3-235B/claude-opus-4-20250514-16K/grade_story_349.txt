<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakened by underdeveloped internal conflicts; Marcus’s drone-pilot past shapes exposition but not profound psychological stakes, limiting emotional dimensionality despite poignant dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective pacing within constraints, but the arc relies on abrupt thematic revelations rather than earned emotional momentum; the resolution feels conceptually satisfying yet psychologically shallow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragments of immersive detail (e.g., unfamiliar stars, candlelit desperation) exist, but the clash between modern drones and medieval fantasy remains unexplored, dulling thematic precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (herbs as memory bridges, magic as communal responsibility) elevate the narrative; however, the moral is occasionally stated too overtly, undermining subtler implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids cliché in premise but falls into sentimentalism; Marcus’s voice shows individuality, yet moments of collective sentiment lean on genre defaults rather than raw, human vulnerability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like herb symbolism and temporal urgency resonate thematically, but narrative cohesion suffers from inconsistent tonal integration of modern-fantasy fusion.</comment>
