<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is well-symbolized but lacks depth beyond metaphor; motivation (resistance to order) is clear but not fully dimensionalized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of quiet rebellion, though the cosmic blink shift feels abrupt despite thematic resonance; pacing is tight yet resolves cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stifling, surreal atmosphere is built through tactile and visual details (shattered mask, tilted objects), enhancing both character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful imagery, subtext (chaos vs. order), and poetic craft elevate the narrative; tone and metaphor are striking but occasionally overshadow narrative immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, idiosyncratic metaphors and layered symbolism avoid formulaic writing; tone is consistent, and emotional resonance emerges through subtext and atmosphere.</comment>
