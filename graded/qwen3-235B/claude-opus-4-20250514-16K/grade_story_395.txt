<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Chen's internal conflict is clear but underdeveloped; motivations are consistent but lack psychological depth. Echo remains enigmatic with limited emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within word limits, but pacing falters during alliance development and heist execution. The festival crescendo feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with ethereal roses and cloud bridges, but sensory details lack textural variety (e.g., sound dominates over other senses).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original setting avoids genre tropes, but some phrasing ("whispering secrets") skirts purple prose. Character nuance in shared outsider status prevents formulaic structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements combine effectively for thematic resonance, but the conclusion feels truncated. Lingering impact present but diluted by structural compression.</comment>
