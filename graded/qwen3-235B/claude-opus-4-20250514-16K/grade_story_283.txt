<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack emotional depth; Mara's conflict between passion and affectation is hinted but underexplored. Internal contradictions remain more intellectual than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight narrative arc feels purposeful within constraints, though momentum sag in middle. Pacing uneven during soil-compression exposition but ends on strong thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the giant shoe's eerie ecosystem. The whip-toe-to-soil connection creates rich symbolic continuity, though atmospheric potential remains partially untapped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphorical layers (circus biology, fragmented communication) elevate concept. Subtle show-don't-tell via Mara's physicality, but emotional beats could echo louder. Strong theme cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original high-concept environment executed with fresh sensory specificity. Avoids formulaic beats, though some elements (soul "yearning") tread familiar thematic ground without radical reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Conceptual framework impresses more than execution. Structural cohesion exists, but feels more like proof-of-concept than fully realized literary triumph. Lingering questions lack narrative urgency.</comment>
