<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Guard’s distraction and ribbon as a relic of personal history are consistent, but his psychological complexity remains muted despite potent symbolism. Motivation through guilt is clear but lacks layered exploration of his internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure relies on thematic cohesion over plot progression. Hourglass manipulation resolves internal conflict but sacrifices narrative momentum; pivotal actions (apology, time-stopping) feel abrupt despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Infernal kitchen’s tactile horror (simmering souls, bitter essences) and metaphysical tension between cosmic silence and intimate redemption are viscerally realized. Atmosphere overwhelms slight setting vagueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (forgiveness as woven ribbon, judgment as crumbling architecture) are striking. Ending’s emotional payoff relies on mythic abstraction rather than psychological realism, balancing ambiguity with thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through surrealistic reinterpretation of “forgiveness” as temporal manipulation. Some phrasing (“terrible pause,” “radical force”) risks preciousness but mostly serves originality. Emotion is shown through setting and symbol, not flat exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements (hourglass, kitchen, ribbon) are tightly braided into a thematic whole, though cosmic silence and “apology’s space” lack precise integration. Conceptual ambition outpaces execution in some transitions.</comment>
