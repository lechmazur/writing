<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth; the introverted empath trait primarily enables supernatural perception rather than shaping her entire psychological profile, resulting in underdeveloped internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective plot momentum from reassembly action, but the compressed word limit creates a rushed conclusion; thematic bookending works despite structural constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting remains superficial - hollow chambers and asteroids lack tangible physics, olfactory decay, or spatial orientation to ground the reader in this sci-fi environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Profound interplay between solitude and legacy; poetic metaphors about fractured truths and the final resonant image of mountains crumbling provide intellectual heft despite minor telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Uncommon imagery (yellowed journal pages as "old teeth") and thematic subversion of pirates-as-philosophers distinguish this from formulaic sci-fi, with only slight overuse of abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overloaded with conceptual ambition; the pirate philosophy and marionette mysticism overwhelm the narrative's ability to convincingly integrate all assigned elements.</comment>
