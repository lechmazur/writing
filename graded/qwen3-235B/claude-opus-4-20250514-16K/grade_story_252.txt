<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's conflicting motivations (penance vs. theft) are clear but psychological depth is sacrificed in brevity; voice maintains consistency but emotional complexity feels abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Circular structure (crack's opening/closure) works well within constraints; some narrative beats (e.g., swing-set moment) feel condensed rather than rushed, maintaining cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create atmosphere but spatial logic of vault-world remains underdeveloped; icy warmth tone is effectively evocative but occasionally uneven in execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylized lyricism amplifies thematic resonance; metaphors (preservation = sin/redemption) are potent; emotional impact lingers through subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Surprisingly avoids clich√©s despite metaphysical premise; sensory specificity prevents overused "magical theft" tropes; emotional nuance emerges through action rather than declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements synergize powerfully despite word limits; some connections (petals as memory conduits) feel conceptually strained, but overall creates memorable thematic framework about cost of preservation.</comment>
