<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is resilient and shaped by loss, but motivations lack nuanced exploration; emotional reactions to memories are implied rather than deeply felt. Dialogue feels slightly performative rather than organically tied to personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on intriguing concept but relies on implausible emotional-to-energy conversion; pacing is efficient yet leaves cosmic implications unearned. Ending fulfills structural completeness but stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive atmosphere from drowned-Earth backstory and sensory details (magnetized boots, pine sap memories). Tone balances grit with melancholy wonder, though observatory's dual purpose feels underintegrated into setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (emotional dark matter, memories in microfilm) elevate themes. However, relies too heavily on telling ("understood the upside of loss") rather than showing transformation. Subtext exists but lacks emotional grit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some lush, original imagery ("gravitational pull of sorrow") but occasionally veers into purple prose. Subversion of AI tropes (fond static voice) is inventive but underdeveloped. Conceptual originality strong; emotional resonance feels algorithmically generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coalesces thematically but strains credibility with quantum-woo explanations. Elements serve plot but integration is uneven; brief length reveals underdeveloped tensions (e.g., station's secrecy). Concludes with lingering thematic resonance but technical execution feels slightly formulaic.</comment>
