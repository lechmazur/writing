<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lin's rationally impulsive trait is competently woven into her character, but her inner conflict and personal stakes beyond her profession lack sufficient depth. Motivation to "weave emotional honesty into illusions" serves the plot but feels underexplored in psychological complexity. The dress reveals her method but not her fully.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing strains coherence in tight word constraints: the revelation about the ventilation shafts and lost child feels rushed despite imaginative premise. Cause-effect between character transformation and mystery resolution holds but requires greater narrative weight. The arc is complete but thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (sunlight through debris, fluttering dress) create mood but timeframe's oil-extraction context is underutilized. Palace-as-theater concept is evocative yet atmospheric integration of historical and speculative elements feels superficial rather than transformative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery, poetic metaphor ("emotional archaeology"), and layered theme of memory/loss elevate storytelling. Emotional resonance relies heavily on poetic tone but avoids outright melodrama. Ending ties theme to character transformation effectively, though some abstraction risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh blend of historical and speculative elements avoids clich√©s, though "anxious serenity" borders on thematic redundancy. Emotional subtext is shown rather than told, but occasional ornate phrasing ("vermillion corridors") slightly undermines visceral impact without feeling wholly excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole but unevenly weighted: some (dress, cold-case method) are indispensable; others (oil depletion timeframe) feel decorative. Story's ambition exceeds word count's capacity for full realization of themes and setting specificity.</comment>
