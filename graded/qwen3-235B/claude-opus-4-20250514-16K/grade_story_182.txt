<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (hunger driving her to seek unclaimed heritage) is present but underexplored; emotional shifts feel more lyrical than deeply earned. Reaction to the spoon lacks tangible connection beyond its symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to revelation to resolution, but the 500-word constraint creates a rushed sense of transformation from passive participant to active revolutionizer. Pacing stumbles slightly during pivotal decision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and precise—dust, magnetic distortion, projector's ghostly light create tactile immediacy. Sensory details expertly reinforce the setting's paradoxical decay-and-wonder, making the world itself a living character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (magnetic blood, ghosts of light, ruined kingdom) resonate powerfully. Subtext about reclaiming history through art rather than preservation adds thematic weight. Ending lands with poetic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on cliché ("fever dream," "bones of a forgotten kingdom") and the magnetic mountain's mechanics remain vague. However, the core idea of a cinema concealing intergenerational secrets feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a satisfying whole despite tight constraints. The brevity feels intentional but some connections (e.g., spoon's significance, magnetic pull's nature) lack full realization. Lingering resonance comes from atmospheric richness.</comment>
