<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Presentation of characters as symbolic essences rather than individuals diminishes emotional investment; motivations exist as poetic gestures but lack psychological depth or convincing behavioral justification.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Structure exists tenuously between poetic vignette and narrative, with too many abstract transitions undercutting traditional plot momentum; thematic resolution feels implied rather than earned within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Cohesion emerges from thematic unity despite surreal elements, though the brevity works both as an intentional poetic choice and an excuse for underdeveloped narrative implications.</comment>
