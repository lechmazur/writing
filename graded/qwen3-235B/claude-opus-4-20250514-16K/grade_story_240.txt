<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight cause-effect chain (need for rain → forging storm → personal transformation) while maintaining narrative completeness within constraints. Pacing falters slightly during metamorphosis conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Setting's tactile descriptions (bark-grown houses, echo-songs from roots) create immersive atmosphere. The forest's sentience and Mirin's physical transformation reinforce thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors ("bark growing along forearms"), layered themes of transcendence, and precise imagery ("voice of dreadful hope") create literary memorability. Ending ties character arc to existential transformation effectively.</comment>
