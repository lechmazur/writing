<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation for revenge through erasure is clear and consistent with his obsession; the 'amiable gambler' persona contrasts effectively with his calculated methods. Interiority is limited but sufficient.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clean arc (charity season as timeframe), with cause-effect logic in memory-erasure mechanics. Pacing is controlled but resolution risks simplifying consequences of erased heirs finding "honest work."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Firefly imagery (light, seasonal lifecycle) elegantly mirrors the story’s themes of gradual transformation and nature’s quiet power. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally overwrought ("phosphorescent gardens").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (petals, fireflies) and subtext (justice vs. vengeance) elevate the story. Ending resonates emotionally without sentimentality, and the prose balances precision with lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>No formulaic elements; the revenge premise is reinvented through soft biotechnology and introspection. Language is purposefully stylized without excess. Nuanced emotional undercurrents avoid being stated outright.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole—the ledger and fireflies symbolize legacy’s fragility. The story's compression enhances its power, and the ending lingers as a meditation on justice.</comment>
