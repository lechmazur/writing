<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's impulsiveness and whimsy drive decisions, but emotional inheritance feels overly abstract; motivations are consistent but lack layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently from discovery to performance, but the decoding of the music sheet via shooting stars feels contrived; climax is effective but the arc leaves some plot threads implied rather than resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered, with waterfall and twilight setting creating emotional resonance; sensory details (scarves, stone texture) enhance immersion and thematically align with the "restless harmony" tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fervent imagery and kinetic prose create emotional engagement; subtext about inherited guilt as performance art is compelling, though some metaphors strain toward significance rather than organically emerging.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending music, movement, and star charts elevates it above tropes, but phrases like "purple bruises across the sky" verge on clich√©; emotional progression feels slightly artificial despite ambitious concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements cohere into a visually rich narrative about memory and justice, though the interconnectivity between "whimsy" and "emotional inheritance" feels uneven; brevity allows focus but limits thematic development.</comment>
