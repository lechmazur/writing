<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and consistent with her awe-inspired curiosity, but backstory is minimal despite veil’s connection. Internal conflict is well-articulated, though emotional depth feels slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured, using the short space to create a complete arc. Transition from discovery to decision is seamless, with cause-effect logic intact. Pacing is tight but never rushed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Highly evocative with rich symbolism and metaphors (Idol of Silence, snowflakes as neural maps). The ending provides thematic closure while preserving emotional resonance. Subtext about choice versus comfort is profound.</comment>
