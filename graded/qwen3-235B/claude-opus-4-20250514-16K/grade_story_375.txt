<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (channelling stellar wrath into creation) drives the plot, but emotional complexity remains surface-level despite the "angry peace" duality. The smile as a mask is visually established but not fully interrogated as a psychological feature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from entry to revelation, but the 500-word structure strains cause-effect logicâ€”how mannequin whispers translate to tower sabotage feels rushed. The assigned "method" works narratively but lacks technical/theoretical specificity to feel earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere through tactile details (scuffed flashlight, rust-eaten walls) and celestial-spatial metaphors anchor the story's abstract themes in visceral reality. The city-as-whale corpse motif masterfully sustains tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (imperfection as conduit, fury as fuel) resonate, but the ending's "radio towers sang her revolution" risks grandiosity. Tension between entropy and creation is compelling but insufficiently anchored in character psychology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leverages "abandoned city" and "mannequins whispering secrets" tropes innovatively, but overwritten phrases ("liquid fire," "angry peace") flirt with self-parody. Some transitions (e.g., flashlight "pulsing" with revelations) feel convenience-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly (scuffed flashlight as flawed conduit, radio towers as resurrection mechanisms), but thematic connections rely too heavily on astronomical jargon rather than organic symbolic development. Achieves cohesion but not transcendence.</comment>
