<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters are minimally developed; Margot’s motivations surface but remain underexplored. Her "charming forgetfulness" feels surface-level, inconsistently applied. Dialogue reveals determination but lacks unique voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant compression but uneven pacing: high-stakes negotiation resolved too quickly. The holograms-stained glass conflict drives the arc, but the ending’s resolution feels rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive contrasts—laser lights vs. stone, champagne scent vs. mold—craft a tactile tension. Sensory details enrich the clash of eras but occasionally veer into ornate excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose balances taut dialogue and metaphor-laden imagery. Subtext about preserving ephemeral beauty elevates the theme. Ending provides resonant closure while leaving philosophical questions open.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through specific, unexpected details (e.g., moldy baguette). Some phrases flirt with preciousness (“old glass sang through new light”), but inventiveness dominates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherent but unevenly weighted; the concept of integration over rejection lingers, but the story’s brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of Margot’s psychology or the collective’s ideology.</comment>
