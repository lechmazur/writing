<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but underexplored, especially internal conflicts between professional caution and ancestral pull.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through object-driven mystery; effective connection between subway journey and ancestral revelation, but pacing occasionally stumbles under density of concepts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength in contrasting subway's sensory realism with Minoan dreamscapes; atmosphere masterfully conveys 'familiar unknown' through tactile details like the binder ring's bronzework.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong poetic imagery and thematic resonance with memory/identity; resolution feels conceptually satisfying but emotionally muted, relying on cosmic coincidence over earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés in structure but struggles with uneven poeticism – some lines ("bull dancers...dolphins leaping across impossible skies") shine while others risk melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine intelligently but unevenly – the knight metaphor and Minoan themes never fully fuse into a transcendent whole despite clever scaffolding.</comment>
