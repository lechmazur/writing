<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the hermit's backstory and emotional stakes remain surface-level despite the poetic language. Nuances of her isolation and scientific fixation could be deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with effective circular resonance (comet’s arrival to departure), but the compressed arc feels rushed during the climactic shift in the weathervane’s motion and the hermit’s realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of sensory details (burning comet light, brittle blossoms) and atmospheric tension between desolation and hope. Setting deeply reinforces the story's themes of rebirth and defiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (album as both memory and map, comet as messenger) and evocative imagery. Ending is emotionally resonant but slightly over-expository. Prose has stylistic grace but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rarely uses tropes without twisting them (comet as destructive/creative force, hermit not merely eccentric but methodological). Avoids purple prose; metaphors are fresh. Subtext about stewardship and interstellar hope feels distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story is cohesive, with elements layered organically to serve theme and tension. The story’s ambition within the word limit is impressive, though some threads (e.g., the grandmother’s seeds) feel underexplored.</comment>
