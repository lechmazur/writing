<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear (betrayal/redemption) but lack psychological nuance; emotions often implied through situation rather than earned; "impulsively thoughtful" is inconsistently demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure shows progression but resolution feels rushed; compressed scope works against full arc development; cause-and-effect connections exist but lack emotional payoff within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Underwater setting uses vivid, marine-specific sensory details effectively; "fractured grace" tone is well-maintained through water imagery and fragmented movement; social upheaval context feels underdeveloped in atmospheric terms.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong subtext in drowned laboratories as mind/emotion metaphors; emotional impact diluted by occasional abstract declarations; stylistic flourishes enhance but occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical combinations (drowning as betrayal) elevate above clich√©; some generic phrases ("dying candle," "weight of water") undercut originality; emotional restraint prevents overt artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive story with thematic weight; setting and central metaphor stand out; brevity strains some character/logic connections but serves poetic impact.</comment>
