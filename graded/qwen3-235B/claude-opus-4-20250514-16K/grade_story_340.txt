<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's compulsive badge-adjusting and self-deprecating humor establish consistent feistiness. Her motivation to outgrow Valdez's shadow drives actions, though her internal transformation from insecurity to irreverence remains surface-sketchy. Dialogue reveals defiance but lacks deeper psychological layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bridge collapse creates urgency, but plot pivots feel slightly too convenient (clock hiccup, timely grimoire revelation). Pacing manages arc within constraints, though the transformation sequence rushes. Logical cause-effect connects elements but lacks nuanced buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Amazon canopy city provides visual backdrop but feels underdeveloped; sensory details are present (grimoire's tremble, green abyss) but surface-level. Treehouse and clocks establish mood without deep integration. Setting serves plot functions without enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Playful cynicism shines through Mara's voice and ironic reversal of aging. Effective metaphor in "shadows to step out of" and purification salts as punchline. Subtext about responsibility's weight emerges through action, though emotional highs lack visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes by twisting time mechanics (aging backward). Natural yet specific details elevate Mara's perspective (oversized badge post-transformation). Some phrasing leans on formulaic "magical dramatics," but overall style balances clarity with quirk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive through Mara's POV filter, though broader thematic connections stay underdeveloped. Elements support plot mechanics more than deepen subtext. Conciseness works for premise but limits emotional complexity. Lingering thought about growing beyond mentors' shadows remains potent.</comment>
