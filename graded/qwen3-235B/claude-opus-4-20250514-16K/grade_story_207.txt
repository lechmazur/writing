<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between oath and justice has emotional weight but lacks nuanced development; meek assertiveness is inconsistently portrayed through occasional strong actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently through compact revelations but feels compressed; the oath-redemption arc resolves too neatly for such high stakes in limited space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid details like "universe's secret song" create haunting atmosphere, but medical bay's physical decay and technical specifics remain underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but create artificial tension - redemption quest feels imposed rather than organically emerging from character logic.</comment>
