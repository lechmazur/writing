<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks deep internal conflict exploration; character's discovery-driven actions align with traits but insufficient emotional evolution limits complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean cause-effect logic with strong central arc, but transitions between labyrinth discovery and thematic realization feel slightly rushed in tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory metaphors (bottled auroras, singing prisms) create immersive atmosphere, but tonal consistency falters in underdeveloped setting details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic architecture (luggage as potential, unmasking as self-acceptance) enhanced by lyrical prose with occasional purple-prose lapses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original concept execution (doubt as strength) avoids genre tropes; labyrinth metaphor feels fresh despite ancient workshop elements bordering on fantasy cliche.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant cohesion of plot and theme within constraints, though the final revelation's emotional impact suffers from compressed narrative development.</comment>
