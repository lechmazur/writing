<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and ironic self-awareness but motivations feel underexplored beneath conceptual layers. The "sweet tooth" motivation feels gimmicky rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints, efficient cause-effect chain, but climax feels compressed. Canyon's role as setting accelerates plot yet lacks full integration with library opening.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blend of mundane library and fantastic canyon creates compelling contrast. Sensory details present but uneven - honey/pistachio grace is inspired while carvings' "mockery" feels overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose winks at reader while maintaining narrative seriousness. Subtext about failure-as-heritage and sincerity/irony duality deepens thematic impact. Ending's mythic tone shift works.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors ("dimensional junction box"), but baklava throughline borders on quirky artifice. Some purple prose ("kaleidoscopic fury") undercuts authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>High-concept elements cohere intellectually rather than emotionally. Successfully avoids template plotting but sacrifices visceral engagement for cleverness.</comment>
