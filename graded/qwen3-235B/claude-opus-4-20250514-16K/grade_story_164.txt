<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth; the blacksmith's "wistful for futures" feels underexplored, and the hacker remains a flimsy foil without significant development beyond predictable arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot flows but lacks structural rigor; the "between acts" timeframe creates false momentum, and the abrupt resolution with the hacker's hinted conversion sacrifices tension for convenience within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding succeeds in tactile contrasts (dust vs. chrome) but leans on overfamiliar cyberpunk-aesthetic tropes; sensory details like the scent of mulch are evocative yet insufficiently distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphor and lyrical prose convey subtext ("wild finds a way"), but emotional impact is blunted by underdeveloped conflict; the ending is poetic but thematically redundant rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in concept but contains predictable phrasing ("releasing the faint scent of mulch that shouldn't exist") and occasional purple prose; the hacker's shift from scorn to curiosity feels algorithmically generated, not earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but rely on thematic scaffolding rather than narrative urgency; the brevity works for its lyrical purpose but lacks the technical polish or innovation expected at the highest tier.</comment>
