<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict development; motivations are clear but lack layered reasoning for transformation from passive recipient to active leader. The professional cuddler identity shapes the protagonist’s role but doesn't deeply inform her individual psychology or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot hinges on underdeveloped cause-effect between market encounter and hangar gathering. Pacing compresses emotional stakes unevenly: sudden collective action feels unearned, and the ending’s thematic turn occurs abruptly. Coherence maintained but strained by word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pungent decay metaphors and sensory details (rust, echoing decay) create lingering atmosphere. Contrast between market’s “usual chaos” and hangar’s ghostly grandeur effectively frames thematic tension. Some underdeveloped connections between spaceport history and present-day emotional decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor (ticket-punching prejudices) elevates thematic resonance. Uneven showing-vs-telling weakens emotional impact; dialogue leans on exposition. Ending’s transformative imagery offers moderate impact but lacks nuanced subtext beneath overt themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but employs familiar speculative tropes (mysterious vendor, secret society) without sufficient subversion. Some sensory details (e.g., “pocketed the punch”) feel schematic. Language occasionally veers toward polished generality rather than idiosyncratic style.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenly. The spaceport and punch are indispensable; the farmer’s market framing and speech-timing device feel contrived. Thematic cohesion exists beneath surface-level execution, but structural seams show in transitions and character logic.</comment>
