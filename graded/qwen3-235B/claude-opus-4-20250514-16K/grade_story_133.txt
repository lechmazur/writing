<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: The jaded locksmith's expertise is visceral in her physical navigation of the labyrinth and possession of tools, but her emotional arc toward understanding the throne's symbolic meaning feels underpaved. The keeper's sudden exposition weakens his motivation's emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: The pottery class opening and wheel-as-throne twist provide satisfying symmetry; weakness: The transition from confrontation to cooperation between characters lacks psychological weight, making the resolution feel rushed despite clever structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Terracotta rooftops and spiraled branches create haunting visuals that mirror thematic duality; weakness: The colonial town's specificity remains decorative rather than integral, weakening cultural resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strength: Synesthetic metaphors (whispering fruit trees, "clay of society") elevate the prose; weakness: The philosophical ending verges on didacticism, slightly diluting emotional impact despite its clever reframing of power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Avoids throne tropes by making it a wheel; weakness: Some phrasing ("imbued," "delightfully menacing") risks pretension without adding dimension. Keeper's motivations occasionally feel like thematic scaffolding rather than lived history.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: Narrative cohesion emerges from intertwined elements; weakness: The tight word limit exposes underdeveloped stakesâ€”swapping the labyrinth for another setting wouldn't fracture the theme but would lessen atmospheric specificity.</comment>
