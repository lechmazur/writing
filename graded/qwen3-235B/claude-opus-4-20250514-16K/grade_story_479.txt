<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped; the juxtaposition of glamorous undertaker and digital preservationist creates intriguing tension but lacks psychological depth in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and momentum through ritualistic actions, though the tight word limit leaves thematic resolution of digital immortality vs. physical mortality underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blending gothic undertaker aesthetics with digital decay creates visceral tension, but sensory details (paint colors, tape texture) occasionally verge on decorative rather than integrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story deftly uses metaphor (measuring tape as legacy arbiter, paint as digital afterlife) to create haunting resonance; the "ordinary myth" theme resonates powerfully despite compressed form.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique premise, but some phrases ("glinted beside her workstation") and abstract descriptions of data transformation risk feeling algorithmic in their precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on memory; the paint-mixing ritual as techno-mystical practice elevates concept beyond gimmickry, though emotional undercurrent remains somewhat constrained.</comment>
