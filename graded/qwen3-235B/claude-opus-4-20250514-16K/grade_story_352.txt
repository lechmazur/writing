<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivations are consistent but underdeveloped. The nomad’s actions align with her goal, but her emotional depth and backstory remain superficially sketched despite evocative dialogue choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression but relies on condensed time to bridge gaps. The arc is coherent within constraints, but pacing occasionally feels rushed during the transition to the pyre scene. Logical flow mostly intact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered with sensory details (e.g., “liquid moonlight,” “softest splash”) that deepen the setting’s thematic resonance. The ethereal tone harmonizes with the concept of preserving the intangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Potent literary devices (e.g., ink as metaphor for memory, the pyre as rebirth) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates emotionally and thematically, though some poetic abstraction risks distancing readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate description (“torn silk,” “ancestral memory”) that prioritizes style over psychological nuance. Emotional resonance is shown but occasionally undercut by lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated with theme and setting, suggesting intentional brevity. The focus on intangible preservation lingers emotionally, though the story’s brevity limits deeper exploration of secondary characters.</comment>
