<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character transformation is conceptually strong but overly accelerated; motivations lack sufficient psychological texture to fully justify the dramatic shift from "warrior" to "man."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exquisite cause-effect logic in reality-deconstruction plot; however, the final escape feels under-explored compared to the methodical unraveling of perception.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imaginative sensory details (lint, hexagonal walls) create immersive dissonance; the clinical underlayer is inconsistently maintained beneath Gothic-inflected metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid thematic coherence between reality-as-performance and linguistic precision; the quiet madness emerges through understated physicality rather than grandiose declarations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through metaphorical layering, but clinical detachment occasionally veers into cold exposition; some descriptors ("precise madness") border on oxymoronic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent and conceptually resonant, but the brevity undermines emotional investment in the protagonist's transformation; secondary elements slightly overshadow narrative intimacy.</comment>
