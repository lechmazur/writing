<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's immortality research and scholarly detachment are consistent, but her emotional detachment weakens relatability; motivations are clear but lack visceral human complexity beyond stated intellectual drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from contemplation to imminent transformation; cause-effect between quantum anchor, journal exchanges, and digitization experiment is logical, though high-concept elements leave some structural gaps in middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid bioluminescent fungi, eternal darkness, and collapsed mine fragments create tactile immersion; mole people’s evolved biology and Archivist lore deepen the setting’s mythic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses metaphor ("reality as malleable data") and symbolic objects skillfully; ending avoids closure while suggesting cyclical transition, though emotional resonance remains intellectualized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; metaphors like "digitize the soul" feel evolved rather than generic; sensory details prioritize vision/touch over other senses, fittingly sparse for the setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize to explore post-physicality: mole people’s memory crystals deepen Elara’s research; the headlamp’s quantum anchor ties setting to theme without feeling forced.</comment>
