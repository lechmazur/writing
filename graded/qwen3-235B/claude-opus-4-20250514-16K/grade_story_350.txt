<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Thalia’s puppeteer background connects to her pattern recognition but remains underdeveloped; her motivation to uncover truth drives action but lacks psychological depth. Assigned traits shape her use of stamps/gown but feel more symbolic than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent path from discovery to revelation, with stamps and gown forming a logical puzzle. The ending feels abrupt but plausible within constraints. Pacing is efficient, though some steps (e.g., decoding process) lack detail.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (marble silence, moonlight) but inconsistent—the ancient Greek temple clashes with anachronistic "puzzle event.” Sensory details engage but could deepen connections between setting and themes (e.g., temple’s history). </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., “marionette strings becoming visible”) and symbolism elevate the story. The theme of hidden truth resonates, and the ending ties her craft to the priestess’s encoded knowledge. Some “telling” (e.g., “truth lived between sounds”) weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging stamps, fabric tears, and ritual. Avoids clichés by reimagining the wedding gown as a coded map. Language is poetic but occasionally veers into abstraction (“symphonies of truth”) without concrete grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements tightly into plot, though the temple’s role feels generic. The “intimate darkness” and puzzle event are underutilized. The story’s strength lies in its metaphorical framework, leaving a lingering impression of art-as-truth.</comment>
