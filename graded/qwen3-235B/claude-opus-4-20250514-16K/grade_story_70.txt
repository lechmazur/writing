<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure works well despite tight word limit, though the discovery of self-changing runes and rune translation process could benefit from more narrative setup without exceeding constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptionally textured world creation through deliberate sensory details - feel of grave-soil-stained fingers, warm bulb vibrations, leaning gravestones create immersive dread-tinged wonder.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©d gothic tropes through Tesla-magic juxtaposition; descriptions are precise without becoming purple prose; emotions shown through actions (glove removal) rather than simply stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into thematically cohesive whole; brevity reveals character transformation effectively; creates intellectual and emotional resonance beyond surface narrative.</comment>
