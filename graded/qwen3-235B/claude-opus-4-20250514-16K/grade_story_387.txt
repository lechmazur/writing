<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic and driven, consistent with the "selfless musician" and "map migration" motivations. Emotional nuance and backstory are thin despite rich setup; motivations are clear but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to revelation but relies on abrupt shifts (e.g., sudden Singer appearance). The action of "lunge" is pivotal, but the pacing feels compressed despite internal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere via salvaged ship details and sensory descriptions of sound, warmth, and decay. The recurring motif of rebirth through recycling enhances tone/motivation. Occasional vagueness with Singers' lore.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dense imagery and metaphors enrich theme of connection through absence. Ending resonates with layered meaning, but emotional beats occasionally lean on abstract phrasing over show-don't-tell. Subtext is strong; dialogue minimal but sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with original concepts (e.g., resonance-based aliens), though some phrases ("savage grace") feel recycled. Sensory details are specific but occasionally overwhelmed by hyperbole. Nuanced emotional beats are implied but not fully rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story cohesively weaves elements into a resonant whole. The concise length allows poetic efficiency, but some transitions (e.g., Singer dialogue) lack build-up. Lingering themes compensate for minor plot gaps.</comment>
