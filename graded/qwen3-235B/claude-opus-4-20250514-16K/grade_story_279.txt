<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's recklessness and motivation to map weather are clear but lack depth; transformation into weather hinted at but underexplored, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on comparing footage but glosses over how she accesses the footage; pacing is tight but the abrupt ending feels unresolved, undercutting completion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, surreal imagery (giant's book, electric peace) creates strong atmosphere; sensory details like sand in the throat ground the reader, though the giant concept remains underexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (paperclip as truth-tool, self-dissolution into storms) and lyrical prose deepen thematic cohesion; ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional payoff due to limited character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original setting avoids tropes, but some descriptions veer into formality ("cathedral-quiet," "charged stillness"); metaphors are fresh, but emotional arcs lean on implied rather than shown reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively, though the giant's book and gradience concept feel secondary; the story's ambition exceeds its grasp but leaves a haunting, memorable concept of cosmic sacrifice.</comment>
