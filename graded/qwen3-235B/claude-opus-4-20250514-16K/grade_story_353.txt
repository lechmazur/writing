<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Martha's duality ("cynically gentle") is consistently shown through her acts of mercy and rebellion, but her inner conflict remains surface-level; motivations tied to oppression are clear, yet her complexity relies more on archetypes than human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong central arc (baker as revolutionary) clashes with compressed pacing; the moon-phase timeline and time machine mechanics are intriguing but under-explained, creating narrative disconnects between cause/effect in the rebellion plan.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie fusion of baking and rebellion (e.g. "yeast's relationship with temporal fermentation," lavender as bioweapon) creates tactile, memorable atmosphere; shadows' whispers and lunar rituals deepen mysticism without feeling derivative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lynching of metaphor ("bread rises; tyrants fall") and poetic symmetry (revolution as fermentation) elevate theme; emotional resonance undercut by sparse character introspection but redeemed through haunting imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in botanical bioterrorism and time-baking parallels; occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("chronometer with lunar charts") and relies on shadow-voices as info-dumping devices, betraying formulaic instincts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion survives its maximalist ideas, with lunar clockwork and bakery-as-weapon integrating surprisingly well; the time machine feels shoehorned despite clever link to yeast, straining suspension of disbelief.</comment>
