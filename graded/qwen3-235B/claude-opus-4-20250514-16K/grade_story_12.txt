<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters show emotional growth, but past history relies heavily on exposition. Motivations are clear but occasionally telegraphed rather than organically revealed through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot contains a clear arc within constraints, though some developments feel slightly accelerated. Concept influences narrative but could deepen causal connections within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is conceptually engaging but under-exploited. The mall's sentient qualities and sensory details show promise but lack visceral immediacy in execution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (ceramic rivers, algorithmic orchestration) enhance narrative depth. Dialogue occasionally favors thematic clarity over naturalism but conclusion resonates through symbolic fusion of personal/professional convergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some conceptual pairings (solitude/connection, technological/human) feel slightly schematic. Sensory descriptions lack distinctive fingerprints that would mark human authorship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story successfully integrates diverse elements thematically if occasionally superficially. The economy of form works to its advantage, though certain components feel conceptually prioritized over emotional urgency.</comment>
