<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's purpose is clear, and her 'unruffled' nature informs her methodical approach, but deeper psychological motivations remain underdeveloped despite vivid reactions to symbols.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc functions, but the constrained format creates slight disjointedness; the central action of 'developing' understanding is cohesive yet occasionally rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Immersive, original atmosphere with rich sensory details; the library as sentient space and ghostly caf√© conversations enhance mood and theme, though some elements verge on overstatement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and layered themes (joy/grief, impermanence, synthesis of contradictions) create emotional resonance; occasional abstraction slightly dilutes the impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Echoes of literary archetypes (library as labyrinth, mythic ranger) are transformed, but some phrases lean into ornate description; emotional nuance emerges through subtext rather than overt declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate seamlessly; the brevity serves thematic compression rather than constraint. The interplay of time, object, and paradox becomes more compelling with reflection.</comment>
