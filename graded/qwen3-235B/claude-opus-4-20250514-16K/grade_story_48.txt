<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited internal conflict and complexity; motivations are clear but superficially explored. The brass ruler as a tool ties to her scientific persona but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Static structure with minimal progression. The apple's fall as a narrative endpoint feels symbolic but lacks a concrete arc or pivotal event to create urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but occasionally overwhelming, with sensory details that sometimes prioritize ornateness over organic immersion. The crow's nest setting is underutilized spatially.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of the ruler and apple fall; themes of interconnectedness resonate. However, emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts rather than character-driven moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mix of inventive ideas (quantum entanglement as love) and borderline clich√©d elements (emotions harvested from stars). Avoids outright predictability but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and conceptually rich but lacks narrative urgency. The short form serves thematic brevity but undermines emotional investment in the character's journey.</comment>
