<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters function as thematic vessels but lack sufficient psychological complexity; Father Marcus's trauma is hinted at but not deeply explored, Elena's emotional shifts feel abrupt despite effective dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Smart use of dance-as-puzzle mechanics creates momentum, but the tight word limit leaves resolution feeling abrupt; the thematic "truth" revelation lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Inventive blending of clinical (psychic facility) and sensory (tango's physicality) elements creates haunted atmosphere, though the mirror-revealed room feels underimagined in its potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor of dance as synthesis of faith/science resonates powerfully; the ending's "haunted dance" line elevates the narrative through layered meaning beyond procedural uncovering.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√© through paradoxical marriage of exorcism and quantum research, but Elena's "cracked facade" confession leans on familiar trauma tropes; language stays precise without purple flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully integrates disparate elements through clever thematic scaffolding, but the brevity prevents full exploration of either the possession case files or the protagonists' psychological landscapes.</comment>
