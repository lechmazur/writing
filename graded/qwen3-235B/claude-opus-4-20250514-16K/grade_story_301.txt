<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks gradual development of ethical conflict; motivations shift abruptly from academic curiosity to unchecked ambition without sufficient emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong conceptual propulsion but feels compressed; pivotal moments (e.g., glove use, reality collapse) rush rather than unfold cohesively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion (melting mug, fraying air) grounds surrealism, though jazz-age elements are superficially tied to supernatural themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("knitting unraveling") and thematic tension between knowledge/ethics resonate, but emotional depth remains surface-level amid cosmic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in tone and premise but slips into familiar tropes (ancient artifacts, hubris) without fully subverting them; avoids purple prose but risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion and thematic ambition, though tight word limits strain character nuance and resolution of metaphysical stakes.</comment>
