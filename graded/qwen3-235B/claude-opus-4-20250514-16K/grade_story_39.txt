<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's dual role as a tailor of both fabric and hope is conceptually strong, but her internal conflict could be more viscerally shown rather than stated. The "earnestly deceptive" trait is consistent, but her psychological complexity remains surface-level despite vivid actions like gripping scissors as instruments of judgment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern's haunting propels the plot effectively, but the resolution with the ghosts' sudden understanding feels slightly rushed within the word limit. Causality connects well (lantern → revelations → reckoning), but the abbreviated confrontation risks undermining the existential stakes of collective survival vs truth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Artificial twilight casting literal and metaphorical shadows creates a haunting sensory motif. The Martian setting permeates details like "oxygen tubes" and survival guides, enhancing verisimilitude. The bookshop's dust-covered spines and holographic phantoms amplify the atmosphere of decaying hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (tailoring lies, enduring "threadbare" truth) are masterfully woven. The ending's thematic resonance—truth as luxury vs. endurance as craft—lingers powerfully. Subtext about memory-making as survival elevates the narrative beyond surface sci-fi tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging Martian survival with textile symbolism. Sensory details avoid generic descriptors ("ephemeral cameos," "acoustics reverberating"). Emotional nuance (defiance tinged with exhaustion) avoids flatness, though a few phrases ("precious thing") veer toward sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements cohesively—each shapes the narrative arc. The brief form feels purposeful, ending on a thematically resonant image of "sculpting hope." Leaves haunting questions about ethics of hope in extremis.</comment>
