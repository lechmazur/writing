<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation from aimless to purposeful is clear but underexplored; her motivation lacks backstory depth but is emotionally resonant through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Predictable progression from discovery to revelation; while coherent, the compressed arc feels rushed in depicting scholarly collaboration's emotional weight and logistical leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie, tactile atmosphere with dust/snow contrasts effectively, but underdevelops the archive's sensory particularitiesâ€”smells of aged paper, acoustics of silence broken by whispers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (flakes as promises, cooking as resistance) deepen theme; subtext about cultural erasure elevates plot beyond procedural decoding into emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids cliche through specific cultural connections; fresh to link hopscotch/needlework to encrypted knowledge. Some ornate phrasing (e.g., "seeds of vigilance") risks didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Crafts poignant synthesis of personal/collective memory, but tighter interplay between setting mechanics and emotional beats could strengthen cohesion.</comment>
