<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation clear but underdeveloped psychology; Elena's actions align with her belief but lack emotional depth beyond thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Causal chain from invitation to dissolution is coherent but feels compressed; climax lacks visceral impact due to pacing constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visually compelling with crystalline towers and liquefying dreams, but limited engagement with non-visual sensory details weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose ("prayers with peculiar faith") elevates thematic resonance; abrupt ending slightly undermines emotional payoff despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in dream-into-physical-conceptual-law mechanism, but impersonation plot device and "quiet pulse" feel like under-investigated tropes; avoids overt purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptually bold but execution suffers from brevity's demands; elements cohere but lack time to breathe, leaving thematic ambition only partially realized.</comment>
