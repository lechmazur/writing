<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations lack sufficient psychological depth; Mara's abrupt shift from assassin to merciful photographer feels unearned despite strong visual descriptions of internal conflict. The driver's introspective moment resonates but remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains structural coherence within constraints, but the connection between the spider's web method and trajectory calculations feels underdeveloped. Pacing balances tension and reflection but relies too heavily on expository internal monologue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's ornate visuals contrast effectively with spacefaring elements, though implausible details (pigeons) disrupt immersion. Sensory atmosphere strengthens emotional undercurrents but occasionally veers into excessive ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Storytelling achieves lyrical intensity through fragmented metaphors and visual symbolism. The camera lens as both weapon and redemption device, paired with the powerful subtext of shared existential emptiness, creates lasting resonance despite minor stylistic excesses.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures with the art-assassination duality, but some phrasing ("tiny nebulae") borders on precious. The core theme of recognition prevents clich√©d redemption arc, though pigeon inclusion risks undermining worldbuilding credibility.</comment>
