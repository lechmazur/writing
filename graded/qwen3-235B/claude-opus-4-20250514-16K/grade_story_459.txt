<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to understand ghosts is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with his goal but inner conflict isn't fully explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent but underdeveloped; some cause-effect relationships feel rushed due to word constraints, though the resolution resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details (humidity, silence as pressure, decaying Victorian dress) that amplify the story's haunting tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (dissolving sand castles, flower crown) and theme of release through non-intervention are effectively layered; ending achieves emotional resonance, but conflict is modest in scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh concept subverts ghost tropes (ghosts tied to sand castles, not graves); prose is precise and stylistically controlled without descending into clich√© or purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates all elements thematically; the concise format is intentional, prioritizing poetic moments over plot development, leaving a contemplative aftertaste.</comment>
