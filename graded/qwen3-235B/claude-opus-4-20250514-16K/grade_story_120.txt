<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character development is strong in Marcus' trauma but lacks depth in secondary characters; motivation through guilt is clear but could explore more nuanced conflict between professional duty and personal failure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is effective in depicting loop progression, but the time-compression device occasionally strains coherence; the resolution hinges on underdeveloped quantum theory, slightly undermining narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel setting creates haunting atmosphere; the sterile hospital and temporal distortion contrast well. Underutilized potential in sensory details beyond visual/tactile elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical structure (Möbius strip, baptism) and emotional resonance through symbolic object. Ending avoids sentimentality while delivering thematic payoff; shows rather than tells trauma's consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original take on time-loop trope through psychological lens avoids cliché but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("excited boredom") that feels concept-driven rather than character-emergent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with thematic purpose; quantum mechanics and trauma interplay feels intentional. Brevity enhances emotional impact through concentrated focus on transformational moment.</comment>
