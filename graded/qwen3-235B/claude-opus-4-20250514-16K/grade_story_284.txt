<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization of Marcus as stoic yet ironically earnest is clear but superficial; his transformation feels rushed within the word limit. Eleanor's role as a foil to his personality is well-conceived but lacks nuance, reducing their dynamic to symbolic gestures rather than authentic character growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a forced serendipity (the wallet), but the tight word count strains the arc's completion. The transition from Marcus's radio stoicism to vulnerability is abrupt, with the resolution feeling tacked-on rather than earned. Pacing falters in balancing introspection and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bee sanctuary's atmosphere is evocatively implied (smoke, veils, humming bees), but the setting remains decorative rather than integral. The contrast between Marcus's "armor" and the sanctuary's openness lacks immersive sensory detail to fully ground the thematic parallels.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (bees as "nature's pirate radio") and the paper plane's subtext elevate the story, but emotional beats rely too heavily on exposition ("stone hearts need pollination"). The ending's thematic resonance is strong, though weakened by over-explaining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, the stoic-with-a-secret-softer-side arc and "hidden depths revealed through nature" trope are familiar. Language veers between striking ("pompous humility") and melodramatic ("frequency; finding himself was the actual broadcast"). Emotional resonance struggles with showing vs. telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rigidly structured around assigned elements at the expense of organic flow. The ending gestures at deeper themes but defaults to sentimental resolution rather than lingering ambiguity. Some compelling imagery, but the narrative cohesion and emotional impact fall short of publication-ready polish.</comment>
