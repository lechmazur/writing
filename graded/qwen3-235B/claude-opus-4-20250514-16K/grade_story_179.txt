<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characterization is poignant but leans on minimalist exposition; motivations (paternal longing, secrecy) are clear but internal conflicts are subtly hinted rather than deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly focused but relies on compressed timelines that sacrifice deeper progression; the pivotal moment of recognition anchors the narrative, though the arc feels condensed rather than underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is achieved through tactile metaphors (fingerprints as memory conduits) and understated imagery (cracked ruler as fractured parenthood). Ending balances triumph and tragedy, enhanced by layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formula through idiosyncratic concepts (fingerprint frequencies), but the beehive motif risks metaphor overload. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, and emotional nuance is shown more than told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances poignancy, and the fusion of scientific precision with raw emotion lingers as a meditation on loss and connection.</comment>
