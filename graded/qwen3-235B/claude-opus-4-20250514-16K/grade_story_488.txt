<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's determination to "transcend" is clear but psychological depth remains abstract; motivations tied to rivalry with reflections drive plot but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant arc compressed into limited space; summoning process logically integrates with quantum metaphors, though transformation climax feels slightly rushed despite strong thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Quantum beach and entropic lighthouse create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere; however, some sensory descriptions (e.g., "corroded rapture") lean on abstraction over visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors of invention as collision between realities are intellectually thrilling; subverts entropy motif through defiant creation; poetic imagery ("probability clouds") enhances thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avant-garde aesthetic avoids genre tropes; "spacetime-thinning" originality; no detectable formulaic phrasing; emotional subtext emerges through symbolic action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity (quantum beach enables summoned alternatives, corroded rapture justifies aesthetic choices); brevity enhances mythic quality; lingers as philosophical meditation on legacy.</comment>
