<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s musical identity feels superficial; her motivation (excavating gardens) is clear but her emotional transition (dismay to purpose) lacks psychological nuance. The 'minstrel' role is underutilized beyond singing to empty chairs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to revelation, but the ending’s decision to descend “tomorrow” feels abrupt. The polaroids as a method of mapping is inventive, though the narrative arc is understated due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting immerses through vivid contrasts (endless city vs. lost gardens). Sensory details (e.g., “moonflowers,” “whiskey”) enrich atmosphere, though the sky-lounge’s rotation feels underexploited narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory and erasure resonate deeply. Symbolism (e.g., broken watch, polaroids as ghostly fragments) elevates the subtext. The ending resonates emotionally, though first-person voice would enhance impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>No clichés or abrupt shifts; imagery is original (“coordinates in shadows”) but occasionally verges on abstraction. Some descriptors (“endless night”) risk becoming ornate, but emotional resonance avoids artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of mapping and storytelling, with cohesive tone. The assigned elements form a coherent whole, though some (sky-lounge, minstrel vocation) feel more tacked on than essential to the core narrative.</comment>
