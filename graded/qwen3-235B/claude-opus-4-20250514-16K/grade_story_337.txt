<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to reclaim futures through fortune-telling is clear but underexplored. Her "reliably unreliable" nature shapes actions, but character depth remains surface-level despite distinct narrative voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through discrete beats (writing fortunes, oracle's feedback, rebellion), but the compressed form strains cause-effect clarity. The ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Surveillance drones, kaleidoscope mirrors, and stolen moments between curfew/sunrise build immersive atmosphere. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally generalized ("sparkle of whimsy" lacks freshness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (glass/water; chipped tile as resistance) elevates thematic tension. The ending's "unshaped futures" effectively crystallizes the central idea without didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dares originality by reframing fortune-telling as algorithmic rebellion. Avoids dystopian clich√©s with tactile details (tile fragments in ink, folding mirrors). Minor over-reliance on "whimsy" and "chaos" risks vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a subversive parable, though some (oracle's arrival) feel perfunctory. Conceptual ambition is high, but the 500-word limit exposes structural seams despite lyrical compression.</comment>
