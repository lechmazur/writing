<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape servitude is clear and consistently demonstrated through his artistic subtext and calculated actions; use of vintage glasses to reveal truth aligns with his role as a silent observer; his disappearance feels like natural culmination of suppressed agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight structure with cause-effect clarity (glasses → revelation → disappearance), but ending's metaphysical resolution risks narrative fragmentation in short form; the miniature sculptures aftercare reveal adds cohesion but feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dust motes as liminal space imagery, brutalist architecture mirroring institutional secrecy, and sediment as historical record create tactile atmosphere that directly enriches both concept and character psychology; sensory details work synergistically with themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "truth calcified in chest" and "sunlight as unguarded door" elevate narrative; tension between physical labor and intellectual imprisonment carries subtextual weight; ending resonates with ambiguous tragedy and transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis of metaphysical escape with concrete setting avoids genre tropes; "dust dance as interdimensional threshold" concept feels fresh; emotional resonance emerges through symbolic action rather than statement; only faint risks of adjective clusters in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements integrate organically (washing car establishes servitude while positioning him for encounter with glasses); brevity serves poetic impact rather than limitation; lingering subtext about art's truth-telling power enhances memorability.</comment>
