<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations and traits are clear but lack deeper exploration of internal conflict; actions align with established traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from setup to execution, but the ending rushes resolution; tension introduced by train whistle and device activation is effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich steampunk atmosphere and sensory details (whirring gears, glowing stickers) enhance mood; some abstract elements ("gods of stagnation") dilute immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of steampunk and lost freedom avoids genre clich√©s; occasional overused phrases ("spinning tales") and slightly mechanical plotting suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the story's anti-authoritarian theme; brevity prioritizes ideas over emotional depth but maintains narrative momentum.</comment>
