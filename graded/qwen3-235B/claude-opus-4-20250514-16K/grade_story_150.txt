<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>McGraw's dual identity as outlaw and poet creates intrigue, but motivations remain partially opaque—the Tucson incident is never fully unpacked, weakening character consistency. His use of the dice reveals personality through action, but emotional depth feels filtered through genre stylization rather than organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rehearsals-as-countdown structure works effectively, with each day's wall message escalating tension. The pivotal die throw and cosmic resolution satisfy narrative momentum, though the compressed timeframe occasionally strains causal logic when connecting stolen dice backstory to present consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Brass gears grinding against shifting prophecies create striking synesthetic contrasts. The observatory's copper acoustics, coffee-stained telescopes, and steam-haunted shadows immerse readers in a cohesive yet otherworldly environment where mechanical precision collides with mystical entropy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose dazzles with metaphysical imagery ("infinite versions of himself—some lawmen, some saints") and thematic contrasts between outlawry/returning. The closing lines achieve poetic resonance, though certain phrases ("saturated ambivalence") lean toward conceptual abstraction over visceral emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>While sensory details and metaphors are often striking, the fusion of steampunk and prophecy risks aesthetic overcrowding. Some phrases ("pneumatic telescopes," "runes pulse with heat") verge on checklist-driven worldbuilding rather than organically developed originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tight integration of Western esoterica and cosmic consequence elevates the narrative. Though the brevity occasionally underdevelops peripheral elements, the story's core alchemy—where cowboy mythology intersects quantum destiny—resonates as both singular and marketable.</comment>
