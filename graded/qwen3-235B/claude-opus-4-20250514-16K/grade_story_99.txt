<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's abilities and sacrifices are compelling, but motivation lacks consistent depth. The casual dialogue feels mismatched with her centuries-old existence and emotional weight, while flashbacks hint at depth but aren't fully integrated into present-tense decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Flashback structure drives plot but undermines cohesion. Story has a beginning/middle/end, but the transitions between memories are jarring, making narrative progression feel fragmented rather than flowing organically through cause-and-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Gothic carnival atmosphere has visceral details like "moldy teddy bears" but underdeveloped setting-character synergy. The decay visually reinforces loss, but deeper connections between her powers and carnival magic could strengthen the atmosphere's thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linguistic precision elevates the metaphor of stories as both burden and salvation. The final revelation about creating one's narrative lands well, though some thematic messaging veers toward direct exposition rather than being fully dramatized through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by familiar melancholic immortal trope. Similes like "crinkled paper like autumn leaves" are sharp, but elements like "empty hands and full heart" risk sentimental clich√©d resolutions that undercut darker premises.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively with uneven execution. The carnival setting feels somewhat disconnected from the broader legend timeframe, while the chopstick wrapper's symbolic role succeeds. The final metamorphosis feels earned despite structural missteps.</comment>
