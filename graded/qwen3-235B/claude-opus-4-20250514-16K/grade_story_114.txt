<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical apathy-as-strength is conceptually intriguing but lacks deeper psychological nuance; motivation to rebuild reefs remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a meditative arc but struggles to establish urgency; cause-effect between apathy and creation feels metaphorically rich but narratively diffuse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through tactile details (coffee grinding, hollow frames) but occasionally over-relies on poetic abstraction at the expense of concrete worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical layering (rivers as wisdom, coral as possibility) elevates craftsmanship; the ending resonates with philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dedicated uniqueness through counterintuitive characterization; minimal traces of overwrought phrasing but compensated by original conceptual intersections.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a lyrical whole; some required elements (e.g., timefram–µ) feel more atmospheric than plot-critical, slightly destabilizing cohesion.</comment>
