<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s intellect and patience are consistent, but her internal conflict between observation and action isn’t fully realized. Her motivation to connect through art is clear, but her emotional arc feels underexplored, relying on thematic assertions rather than nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The plot adheres to the word limit with a clear arc, but the transition from creating art to sentient bay response lacks buildup. Logical cause-effect exists (art triggers ecosystem reaction), but the climax feels abrupt despite tight pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery in bioluminescent details and FTL context establishes atmosphere, but sensory variety is limited (e.g., minimal tactile/auditory elements). The doll and bay are connected, but the setting’s potential as a living entity is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of transient beauty resonates via the ephemeral sculptures and Elara’s introspection. The ending is poignant but slightly sentimental—subtlety falters when the plot explicitly states her “perceived weakness” rather than showing it organically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original in merging “lost civilization” with bioluminescent sentience, but the doll-as-invitation trope and “observer as hero” setup lean on familiar sci-fi conventions. The writing avoids excess ornamentation but occasionally simplifies emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story’s core idea lingers, but its brevity constrains deeper thematic resonance. Assigned elements are well-integrated, though the balance between poetic metaphor (e.g., vulnerability as communication) and narrative momentum wavers.</comment>
