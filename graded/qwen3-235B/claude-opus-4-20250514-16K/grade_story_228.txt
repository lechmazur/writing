<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's ambition and rebellion are clear, but motivations occasionally lean on internal monologue rather than actions. The clothespin-as-symbol ties to her drive effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm as catalyst works mechanically but undermines tension by making her escape feel too convenient. Pacing is tight but resolution leans on metaphor over plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Oppressive sterility of the bunker is viscerally rendered through sensory details (artificial lights, relentless drumming) and contrasts with the implied "wild unknown." Atmosphere amplifies theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imagery (seed/revolution parallels) and layered metaphors (herbs regenerating "hope") elevate the narrative. The ending balances closure and ambiguity while maintaining thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids cliche by focusing on internal rebellion over plot mechanics. Language is precise, though the "stirring dream" conclusion edges toward overfamiliarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Creative use of prompts elevates the story; elements guide tension without feeling forced. Brief length serves the character-driven arc. Ending lingers without over-explaining.</comment>
