<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but strains under the word limit; the climax’s magical awakening feels rushed despite strong cause-effect logic in the brother’s childhood signal and final revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially rich (e.g., "ravenously gentle eyes," carnival decay) but occasionally leans on ornate descriptors that dilute atmosphere’s impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotive subtext and layered metaphors (stamps as breadcrumbs, magic in release) elevate the narrative; the ending transcends sentimentality to underscore thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally falters in rhythmic pacing (e.g., overly dense imagery in carnival descriptions); emotional beats feel earned more than stated, though not fully nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole despite brevity; the constrained length amplifies thematic urgency, though the resolution’s abruptness sacrifices deeper character payoff.</comment>
