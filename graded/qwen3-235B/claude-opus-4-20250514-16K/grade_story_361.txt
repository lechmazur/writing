<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve knowledge is clear but trapper identity feels underdeveloped; emotional depth exists but could be more nuanced through specific actions, not just descriptions of intuition and heritage.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear countdown but resolution feels slightly rushed; emotional beats about cultural preservation are strong, but the mechanics of uploading equations lack specificity that could enhance believability within the tight timeframe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details in the diner (holographic Cree/binary menus, orbital-trajectory coffee machine) create a compelling hybrid world; however, the boarded schoolhouse's atmosphere could be more sensorially developed to match the diner's immersive richness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling is highly effective through layered metaphors (e.g., dice constellations as knowledge key, server-seed scattering) and thematic subtext about cultural erasure; the ending's juxtaposition of digital "seeds" with ancestral star maps resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging indigenous mathematics with quantum metaphors, avoiding shallow "magical tradition vs. cold tech" tropes; occasional overly ornate phrases ("hearth-fire of his people's genius") slightly detract from otherwise fresh synthesis of ideas.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive despite dense concept integration; some elements (trapper identity) underserved, but thematic urgency and inventive worldbuilding suggest deliberate, meaningful design to the structure.</comment>
