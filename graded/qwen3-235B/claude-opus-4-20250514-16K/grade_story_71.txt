<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Poor emotional depth despite unique motivation; actions align with "fervent apathy" but feel repetitive, lacking evolution in guarding behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but compressed; VR breach introduced forcefully, with resolution feeling abrupt rather than earned within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich visual atmosphere undermined by uneven sensory specificity; tactile details (e.g., burlap texture) absent, weakening immersion in "fossilized giant" setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("reality's edge") diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts; ending lacks emotional resonance despite strong thematic throughlines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of VR and ancient forces feels fresh, but occasional clich√©d phrases ("pixels scatter like dandelions") and detached narration reduce impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cohesive worldbuilding strained by uneven execution; conceptual ambition exceeds emotional engagement, leaving lingering intellectual but not visceral impact.</comment>
