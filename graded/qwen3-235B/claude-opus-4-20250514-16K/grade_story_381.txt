<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's necromantic skills and baseball cap are present but underexplored; motivation to map caves is clear yet shallowly contextualized; dialogue with AI lacks emotional complexity; voice feels generic despite first-person narration</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mapped plot arcs work within constraints but feel rushed; mapping action integrates with setting but anomaly detection feels abrupt; time shifts between scanning sets provide structure but disrupt momentum; narrative arc is complete yet underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Crystalline cave's quantum/spectral descriptions create vivid atmosphere; futuristic nostalgia inconsistently applied—strong in personal artifacts (cap) but thin in broader worldbuilding; sensory details unevenly distributed between tactile (cap) and underdeveloped olfactory/gustatory elements</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptual mapping through cinema provides clever framework but remains surface-level; "sound of resolve" motif is underused thematically; writing style favors exposition over immersive showing; metaphors (quantum crystals, human-AI bond) lack transcendence</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overused necromancer tropes through quantum-spectral fusion; cinematic mapping system shows ingenuity but strains internal logic; emotional beats (grandfather's cap) feel genuine without over-explanation; some purple prose in tech descriptions mars otherwise crisp prose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but unevenly integrated—movie references and scarcity concept feel forced; quantum-cave nexus works cohesively but theme lacks resonance; brevity both asset (concise worldbuilding) and constraint (underdeveloped character stakes)</comment>
