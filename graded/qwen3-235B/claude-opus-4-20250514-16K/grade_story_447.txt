<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character is well-motivated by personal loss and moral dilemma, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level; the transition from "dutifully defiant" to quiet rebellion occurs without sufficient psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Precise cause/effect through ephemeral bulletins drives the plot effectively; pacing within the tight word count is disciplined, though the resolution feels slightly compressed, missing a beat of earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (steam, soup, stuffed toy) create texture but fail to fully realize the "amber prison" metaphor; atmosphere leans more on concept than visceral immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (soup/cooking as creation/destruction) and subtextual themes of complicity vs. healing; ending balances hope without sentimentality. The "warmth" of the toy ear is a masterstroke of emotional economy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in linking future-bulletins to cooking's alchemical process avoids genre tropes; avoids "chosen one" clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar grief-redemption arcs without sufficient complication.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story achieves remarkable cohesion under tight constraints; elements serve narrative, but broader sociopolitical context of the "fractured community" remains underexplored, leaving thematic potential partially unmet.</comment>
