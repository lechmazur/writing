<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Marta's internal conflict remains abstract, relying on symbolic gestures rather than concrete emotional stakes. The "chains" metaphor dominates over authentic psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics hinge on a single revelation that feels compressed within 500 words. The cause-effect between restoring recordings and baking bread is logical but underexplored; pacing falters during emotional crescendos, rushing toward a tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory alchemy—auroras, cardamom scent, tactile details of the scale—creating a mythic, almost hallucinatory tension between tradition and rebellion. Northern lights function both as literal setting and metaphorical pressure valve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emotional impact derives from layered metaphors (chains dissolving like frost, kneading as feminist act), though reliance on lyrical prose occasionally verges on self-conscious. Subtext about intergenerational female oppression resonates, but some "showing" slips into poetic telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mix of inspired choices (recipes as coded resistance) and clichéd devices (auroras as witness, frost metaphors). Language oscillates between striking ("brass arm balancing") and overwritten ("weight of inherited sorrow lifting like steam"). The "quiet revolution" trope feels algorithmically familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack synergy—the northern lights viewing platform feels superfluous, while the vintage recording's emotional payoff is undermined by the rushed restoration process. The theme lingers, but structural seams between plot and concept remain visible.</comment>
