<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic arc but relies heavily on symbolic shorthand that dilutes causal logic between discovery and transformation; pacing feels slightly compressed for emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visionary use of mythic fragments avoids formula; emotional subtext emerges organically through metaphor rather than exposition; language is precise and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story transcends element-checklist through thematic coherence; compression serves the mythic tone but slightly undermines the reaper's internal pivot between professional identity and personal longing.</comment>
