<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Twist-driven structure works within constraints; pacing efficient but resolution feels slightly rushed, particularly the "truth as weapon" conclusion.</comment>

<question>7 G</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Chamber effectively grounds ritualistic tone but lacks distinctive characteristics distinguishing it from generic secret society tropes.</comment>
<question>7 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sunset establishes transience and false warmth; timeframe meaningfully intersects with philosophical revelations about deception.</comment>
