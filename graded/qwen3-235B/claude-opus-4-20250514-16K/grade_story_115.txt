<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elaraâ€™s motivations and actions are consistent; her history with Voss and internal conflict drive the narrative. Her exasperation and vulnerability create depth, though emotional shifts could be more subtly rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc despite the constraints, but the sudden resolution feels underdeveloped. The method (wishes via molecular reconstruction) strains logic, yet serves thematic goals.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nano-scale city offers vivid imagery but remains underutilized. Sensory details hint at atmosphere but lack immersion. The timeframe concept is underexplored as a narrative device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (mask as a bridge) and themes of reconciliation resonate. The ending is satisfying but slightly pat. Subtext about scientific ethics adds depth, though emotional resonance relies too heavily on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise avoids major tropes but leans on "nano-technology" shorthand. Sensory details are vivid but sparse. Wishes as a plot device risk formulaic execution but are integrated with character growth.</comment>
