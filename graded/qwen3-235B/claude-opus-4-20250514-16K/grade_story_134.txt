<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's politeness-as-irritant strategy cleverly defines her character but lacks emotional layers. Her motivation feels conceptually driven rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Well-structured within constraints, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt. Laundry-cycle timing devices the plot effectively, but the victory lacks immediate consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of mystical chamber and mundane laundry machines creates memorable atmosphere, but sensory details remain unevenly distributed with over-reliance on auditory/temperature cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Excellent technical execution with clever thematic throughlines about suppressed voices and academic ambition. Lacks marginally in emotional investment despite strong craftsmanship.</comment>
