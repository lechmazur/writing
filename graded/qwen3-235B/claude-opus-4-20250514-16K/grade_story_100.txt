<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character consistent but lacks emotional depth despite coherent motivation; the "rationally mischievous" trait is present but underexplored beyond plot-driven actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and concise, though the constrained word count flattens tension; the cosmic revelation feels inevitable but slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive atmosphere with precise sensory details; the enchanted orchard and moon paths are cohesive, though the statues occasionally verge on undermotivated worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (dreams as reality’s scaffolding) and thematic cohesion elevate the story; the ending resonates conceptually but slightly overexplains the cosmic metaphor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original premise with no obvious clichés; language occasionally leans on lavish abstraction but avoids over-decorated prose; emotional subtext is nuanced but risks obscurity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are interconnected but occasionally feel symbolic to a fault; the ending lingers but the short length occasionally compresses themes too tightly.</comment>
