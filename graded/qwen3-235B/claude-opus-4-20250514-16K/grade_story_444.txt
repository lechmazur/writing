<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera's abstract mission overshadows personal motivation; actions reveal stoicism but not layered psychology. Character exists more as thematic vessel than fully realized figure. Voice remains conceptually unified but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative follows clear arc but relies on compressed exposition. The inciting action (draping the costume) resolves efficiently, yet rapid transitions between surreal states lack organic causality. Pacing balances urgency and reflection but risks narrative abstraction over coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Decaying zeppelin merges literal and metaphorical decay; water's pressure and radio static become tactile metaphors for liminality. Sensory contrasts (frayed costume vs. metallic wreckage) and temporal dissonance create haunting atmosphere that directly serves thematic and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story thrums with existential tension through cyclical metaphors (costume's disintegration, origami birds). Literary devices transcend ornamentation, shaping narrative architecture. Subtext about collective consciousness gains urgency in ambiguous ending that privileges philosophical resonance over narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rarely do surreal conceits feel earned. Radio-static communication avoids genre clichés by becoming an ontological framework. Writing displays individual style through rhythmic cadences and precision-adjacent-to-prose-poetry. No formulaic elements; emotional beats emerge organically through symbolic action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Element integration demonstrates ingenuity rather than necessity—the chain of letters and ghost costume feel symbiotic. While the tight framework creates conceptual momentum, some core components (fierce ambassador trait) remain underexploited, limiting overall cohesion.</comment>
