<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character defined through symbolic gestures rather than clear motivation; actions like leaping for thunder feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded, weakening emotional resonance despite poetic descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Non-linear progression works within constraints, with the album's dissolution driving action; resolution feels slightly abrupt but maintains thematic cohesion despite compressed pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegiac, decaying setting rendered with specific details (e.g., "treehouse walls groaning," "funeral shrouds" skies); atmosphere intricately mirrors character's fractured psyche and longing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-driven prose elevates narrative; thunder as awakening, equations as self-fragmentation, and cricket's dual role as betrayal/trust mechanism add layers; ending delivers epiphany through precise imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic AI phrasing with unique synesthesia (e.g., "thunder equals..." math), unconventional characterizations, and subverted redemption arcs; avoids emotional overstatement while maintaining depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist harmoniously in tight space; some tension between cricket motif and core concept of fragmentation feels underdeveloped, but overall synthesis of setting/theming showcases editorial readiness.</comment>
