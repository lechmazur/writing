<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's traits of "patient librarian" and "hyperactively serene" surface in gestures and narration but lack psychological depth; her transition from rage to emptiness feels underexplored despite vivid descriptions. Marcus remains a functional antagonist without nuanced motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient within constraints, with inciting incident, confrontation, and resolution coherently structured, but the 20-year backstory feels compressed, leaving some emotional beats (Eliza's final emptiness) underserved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (steam, brass gears, mixtape acoustics) immerse effectively. The steampunk setting and memory timeframe deepen tone, though the dining hall’s mechanisms occasionally prioritize aesthetic over thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poignantly subverts revenge tropes via the hollow victory, with layered metaphors (sticker sheet as "battle flag") and resonant irony in the mixtape's dual role as weapon and elegy. Dialogue and restraint elevate emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but occasionally leans on "steam-warmed air" clichés and overwrought phrases ("academic council would revoke his tenure by morning"). Sensory and emotional beats are vivid but show minor genre predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements (mixtapes, setting, themes) are tightly woven into the narrative, with economy of form enhancing the theme of contained rage. The ending’s melancholy lingers, though Eliza’s internal shift feels slightly rushed.</comment>
