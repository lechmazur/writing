<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's transformation is clear but motivations could be more nuanced; the "dishonestly honest" trait drives key scenes but inner conflict is underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works thematically but the word limit strains cause-effect clarity between revelations and plot beats; exposition in flashbacks occasionally disrupts momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory contrasts (rainforest vs. sterile clinic) but setting's connection to character's voice remains surface-level; missed opportunities to deepen atmosphere-shaping metaphors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic layering (sheet music as truth/identity); thematically cohesive ending with emotional resonance; shows transformation through actions rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors, organic emotional progression, and distinctive voice avoid formulaic patterns; yodeling subverts expectations while maintaining narrative logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like sheet music and rainforest are integral but doctor's waiting room framing feels slightly contrived; overall cohesion through thematic interplay rather than structural necessity.</comment>
