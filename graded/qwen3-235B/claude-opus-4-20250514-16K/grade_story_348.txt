<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Minimal internal conflict undermines depth; reverence and curiosity are clear but lack nuanced psychological complexity or growth within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum falters during exposition-heavy segments; the airport prologue struggles to organically connect with the ancestral lab payoff despite functional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., phosphorescent jars, overgrown paths) create a haunting atmosphere; however, timeframes (airport vs. ancestral home) feel insufficiently unified.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (insects as spiritual compasses) elevate craft, but the ending leans on implied revelation rather than earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Occasional "purple prose" cadence; while woodland mysticism avoids clich√©s, somnambulant epiphany trope lacks sufficient subversion to feel fully original.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but uneven execution; elements serve plot mechanics more than thematic transcendence, leaving atmospheric richness underexploited.</comment>
