<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually-driven with clear traits and transformation, but emotional depth feels imposed rather than organically revealed through nuanced choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative arc is discernible but compressed; the thematic pivot feels slightly rushed despite clever cause-effect linkages between arrogance and physical/metaphysical consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent—surreal objects like soul-reflecting mirrors coexist uneasily with the hiking trail's mundane grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("iron bars bent like failed prayers") and resonant thematic closure elevate the craft, though the ending’s didacticism slightly diminishes its poetic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but contains slightly overwrought phrases ("weight of every boundary"); the humility lesson leans on established wisdom tropes rather than subverting them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive in service of theme but occasionally strained—disguise room’s spy/narrative function mismatch and hiking trail’s banality versus mystical tone create micro-dissonances.</comment>
