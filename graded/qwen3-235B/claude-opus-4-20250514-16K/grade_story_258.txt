<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's past as memory-locksmith is intriguing but underdeveloped; motivation for preservation lacks personal stakes beyond vague cultural obligation; "jaded wonder" mentioned but not fully embodied in actions; distinct voice undercut by abstract descriptions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with dancing as central action driving discovery and resolution; some rushed elements (e.g., rapid acquisition of dances), but circular structure (leaf drop beginning/ending) creates satisfying closure; internal logic of "motion-based locks" cleverly ties to theme</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is extraordinary: salt-spray-kissed apples, creaking driftwood, living libraries; sensory details vividly connect physical and metaphysical; setting functions as active participant; metaphysical driftwood orchard interacts meaningfully with preservation theme</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful emotional undercurrent of cultural erasure and embodied memory; metaphors (dancing as preservation method, body as archive) resonate; ending achieves thematic symmetry; "storm of secrets" as both literal and metaphorical awakening; pacing occasionally falters but recovers</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes; sensory details specific rather than generic; some abstract phrasing ("jaded wonder") risks vagueness; emotional progression shown through dancing, not stated; no artificial dialogue; tone strikingly consistent despite shifts; metaphors mostly fresh (trees as choreographic archives); resists predictability in favor of lyrical originality</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Beyond checklist elements, the story coherently intertwines all components into unified whole; the "torn map corner" and "dust yearbooks" cleverly contrast colonial erasure with embodied preservation; theme of ephemeral cultural knowledge runs through all elements; creates lingering meditation on memory and loss</comment>
