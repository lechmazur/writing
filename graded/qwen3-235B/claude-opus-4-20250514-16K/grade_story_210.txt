<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's scholarly curiosity and scientific rigor are well-defined, but emotional depth between ambition and humility remains underexplored. Rebellious determination is clear but lacks humanizing contradictions or vulnerabilities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical structure with the crossword framing device, but progression from curiosity to revelation feels compressed. The quantum-maritime fusion concept drives action but lacks narrative tension or obstacles beyond academic skepticism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional: salvaged wood's sonic memories, flickering lamplight, and autonomous shadows create an immersive liminal space. Sensory details about vibrating timbers and spectral harmonics strongly anchor the supernatural in tactile physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "language of shadows" elevate the narrative. However, the ending's triumphant tone feels overly exposition-driven; the revelation about time folds needed subtler integration through Marina's transformed perspective rather than declarative summation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s by connecting folklore to quantum mechanics, though "whale songs predicting earthquakes" borders on convenient worldbuilding. Character logic remains internally consistent despite fantastical premise; prose occasionally defaults to adverb-laden descriptions ("confidently," "suddenly").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Genuinely innovative fusion of hard science and mythology creates intellectual momentum. Some elements (crossword, lighthouse) feel purpose-built for the theme rather than organic components of a cohesive whole. Lingering questions about reality vs. delusion could have been exploited more richly.</comment>
