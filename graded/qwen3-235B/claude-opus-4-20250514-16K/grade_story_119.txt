<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited depth; motivational consistency exists but lacks emotional grounding. The interplay between compassion and survival is underdeveloped, relying on abstract concepts rather than organic character behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on functional cause-effect but suffers from compressed pacing. Climactic resolution feels abrupt, with underexplored consequences of Mara's final action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting lacks sensory specificity beyond surface-level decay imagery. The astral-carnival convergence feels conceptually undercooked, squandering atmospheric potential through vague descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolic elements (key as psychic conduit, shadows as liminal space) elevates the narrative. However, the theme of compassionate sacrifice lacks transcendence beyond genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality is diluted by gothic horror tropes (cursed carnivals, shadow entities) executed with slight technical flourishes. Repetition of "sometimes always" risks pretension without adding structural depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story demonstrates competence but fails to transcend its formulaic scaffolding. Some cohesive integration of elements, but the narrative momentum and thematic resonance remain firmly mid-tier.</comment>
