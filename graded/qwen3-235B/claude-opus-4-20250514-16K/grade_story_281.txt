<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcel’s transformation feels abrupt despite poetic catalyst; motivation driven by external force rather than organic internal conflict, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear progression from theft to redemption, but the timeframe compresses Marcel’s epiphany into a slightly implausible brevity despite effective setup/resolution cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tactile details (steam, gears) immerse but lack visceral specificity; lighthouse’s symbolic resonance is underdeveloped beyond metaphorical prison for the soul.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Verses-as-transformation device is inventive; dummy’s dialogue wavers between haunting and didactic, undermining subtlety of themes like self-theft/identity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Resists cliché (poetic redemption) through surrealism; some phrasing (“full heart”) risks sentimentality, but dummy’s paradoxical authority feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a publishable whole but lean on familiar redemption arcs; ending’s recursive door hints at universality but lacks narrative daring.</comment>
