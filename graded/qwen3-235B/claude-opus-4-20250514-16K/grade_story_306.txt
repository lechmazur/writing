<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rounded character with clear motivation, but lacks deeper exploration of her psychological evolution from celebrity to scientist. Voice and actions align, but emotional complexity is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Efficient propulsion through key plot beats; however, the final transcendence lacks narrative weight. Some cause-effect relationships feel streamlined rather than organic within the constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid fusion of scientific and mystical elements creates compelling atmosphere. Sensory immersion is strong, with resonant details about sound, light, and texture anchoring the surrealism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (music as reality's foundation) and layered conflicts (faith vs. physics) elevate impact. Ending is emotionally resonant but slightly sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of scientific and occult concepts avoids formulaic clich√©s. Language is purposeful with fresh metaphors; emotional nuance emerges through actions and imagery rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly to thematic effect. Economy of form feels intentional, though some nuances (e.g., ambition's cost) could be more fully realized within the brevity.</comment>
