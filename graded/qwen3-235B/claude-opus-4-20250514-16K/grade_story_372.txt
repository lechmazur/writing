<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is partially developed through backstory but lacks emotional depth; betrayal drives her indifference, but reactions to being captured feel inconsistent with survival instincts. Voice is stylized but sacrifices psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within word constraints, using the instant of tasting as narrative fulcrum. Pacing is taut but relies on familiar chase tropes; the betrayal arc resolves cleanly if unsurprisingly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends cyberpunk elements with intimacy, using sensory details (neon light, noodle steam) effectively. Setting feels derivative but functional; urban decay supports rather than transforms the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Uses avalanches and reflections as potent metaphors for surveillance and identity. Subtext about love/conspiracy parallels elevates the narrative; ending's stoic dignity creates lingering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s with urban exploration-as-betrayal metaphor but contains scattered ornate descriptions ("ghosts of better days"). Emotions shown through actions rather than stated, though some similes border on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically if not always structurally; reflection motif and survival indifference create conceptual unity. Style occasionally overpowers clarity; left me pondering betrayal's paradoxes.</comment>
