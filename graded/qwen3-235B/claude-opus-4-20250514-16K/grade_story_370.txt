<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is conceptually driven but lacks lived-in depth; emotional resonance remains surface-level despite generational context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but feels slightly constrained by the word limit; the implied future rebellion lacks payoff within the story’s scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Quantum foam and buried optimism create vivid juxtapositions, but desert sands metaphor feels incongruously tacked onto the setting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in combining quantum theory with familial rebellion; occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., “pockets of possibility”) borders on clichéd surrealism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Elements are mostly woven cohesively, but the desert sands and quantum foam struggle to harmonize, slightly fracturing narrative unity.</comment>
