<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya’s struggle between cosmic heritage and earthly routine is evident, but her internal stakes lack deeper emotional weight; motivations are implied rather than fully fleshed through nuanced choices or contradictions beyond her immediate dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ritual choice structure is clear, but the compressed arc leans on familiar ascension tropes; pacing balances introspection and action but falters slightly in the abrupt leap as resolution, which feels rushed despite rich buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid cosmic imagery contrasts with the factory’s mundanity, but the terrace’s abyss and gargoyles remain atmospheric garnish; sensory details are present but inconsistently woven to deepen Maya’s personal transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., “textile patterns as constellations”) and the theme of hidden potential resonate; the ending’s symbolic leap feels earned, though some emotional beats rely on well-worn mythic structures rather than fresh subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of industrial labor and cosmic identity is original, yet the family ritual and “doubt” motif border on cliché; prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction, but imagery like “wings made of nebulae” avoids excessive predictability.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive metaphor for self-actualization, though certain components (e.g., gargoyles) feel perfunctory; the brevity amplifies themes but sacrifices deeper exploration of the ritual’s generational weight.</comment>
