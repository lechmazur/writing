<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character transformation is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of psychological conflict; motivations are conveyed through exposition rather than lived emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but resolution feels abrupt within the word limit; cause-and-effect between stanzas and emotional dismantling requires more textured progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details about rusted machinery and shifting light masterfully contrast human fallibility with cosmic ambition; atmosphere directly fuels thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic devices are abundant but some metaphors ("hushed euphoria") veer toward abstraction; ending provides satisfying thematic closure but emotional impact feels slightly engineered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing ("sorrows coded in thread") that prioritizes style over organic evolution; emotional subtext is implied but could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Elements cohere impressively under strict constraints; the fusion of familial legacy, physical space, and metaphysical transformation achieves layered thematic complexity.</comment>
