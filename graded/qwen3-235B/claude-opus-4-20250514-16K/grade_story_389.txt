<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's physical trait (thin lips) isn't meaningfully tied to personality; motivation lacks psychological nuance despite driving actions. No distinctive voice in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rushed pacing between ritual execution and collapse; underdeveloped connection between time frame (Dec 31st) and plot mechanics. Logical gaps in artifact transformation process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (crackling pages, collapsing books) effectively immerse reader. Setting-timeframe relationship feels superficial but atmospheric cohesion strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid imagery but lacks emotional resonance; theme of knowledge's danger feels underexplored despite clear symbolism. Ending shows, rather than deepens, thematic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overreliance on gothic tropes (human-skin books, forbidden knowledge) with minimal subversion. Some metaphor freshness but excessive adjectives dilute impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative integration; New Year's Eve feels arbitrary. Stylistic ambition exceeds emotional depth; leaves more questions than resonance.</comment>
