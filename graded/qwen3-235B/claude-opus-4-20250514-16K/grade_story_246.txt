<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marlene's motivation is clear but some reactions feel rushed; emotional nuance between sisters could be deeper within constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves from revelation to resolution efficiently, though contraction of the anomaly feels compressed; pacing mostly effective but slightly uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through magnetic anomaly and auroras, but sensory details (e.g., smell of aged linen, sound of dead phone) could enhance immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance via symbolism (handkerchief as chain, polymerization of regret); ending achieves thematic closure with clocks and ringing phone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original use of "polymerize" as metaphor; avoids most clich√©s but inherited curses remain a well-worn trope despite fresh framing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but some (e.g., "discretely flagrant") underexploited; the ending lingers thematically but brevity slightly underdevelops payoff.</comment>
