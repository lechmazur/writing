<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: The sentinel’s role as watcher/rememberer creates existential urgency. Weakness: Lacks inner struggle nuances—motivation feels abstract, not earned through actions beyond repetitive spinning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strength: Escalating tension between cyclical reset and melodic escape creates cohesion. Weakness: Pacing stumbles—exposition about 17 years feels inserted, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strength: Abandoned storefronts, holographic audiences, and bleeding dawn evoke a decaying simulation. Weakness: Holographic audiences aren’t meaningfully tied to the coin’s mechanics, reducing atmospheric unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors (coin-song as memory encoding, “ladder of sound”) deepen theme. Weakness: Ending’s emotional impact diluted by overly romanticized language (“hollows carved by iron” feels overwritten).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: Subverts AI-default nostalgia tropes with “memory-harvesting simulation” conceit. Weakness: “Sorrow’s Junction” leans on clichéd ghost-town imagery without full reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Tightly woven integration of elements creates thematic momentum. Weakness: Simulated reality structure feels derivative despite execution quality.</comment>
