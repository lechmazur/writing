<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and self-realization, but internal conflict lacks sufficient vulnerability or idiosyncratic behavior to transcend archetypes; her dual role as courier-weaver is conceptually strong but psychologically thin.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression toward epiphany works within tight structure, but lacks dynamic plot movement or tension between past/present; transitions between revelation phases feel compressed rather than deliberate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid contrast between neon-tech and Celtic elements creates strong atmosphere, but deeper integration of how this clash affects daily rituals or societal contradictions would enhance authenticity beyond aesthetic juxtaposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Courage-as-physical-matter metaphor is inventive; thematic exploration of cultural evolution through storytelling resonates. Certain passages veer into abstract sentimentality rather than earned emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through fusion of old/new, but some descriptors ("glowing with ancient light," "bittersweet revelation") trend toward poetic generality rather than distinct voice; emotional beats occasionally stated over shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding and thematic fusion of tradition/progress work in cohesion, though the brevity leaves some elements (timeframe, elders) under-exploited; concept-to-emotion ratio tilts toward abstraction.</comment>
