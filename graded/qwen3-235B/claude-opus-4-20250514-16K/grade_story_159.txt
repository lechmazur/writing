<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority beyond stated motivation; actions flow logically but feel transactional rather than psychologically nuanced. The philosophical transformation needed more earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion within constraints, though confetti-coded proposal mechanic strains believability. Light-induced labyrinth mapping conceit works narratively but could use more precise cause-effect timing to avoid perceived leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Labyrinth atmosphere excels with vivid lantern imagery, but the sandstone environment remains underexplored. Sensory details about desert texture, confetti texture/sound could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Story shines through metaphor density: light fracturing as wisdom, celebration as revelation engine. The ending's epiphany about loss creating doors works sublimely, though some "wisdom hides" phrasing verges on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by occasional conceptual clutter—floating lanterns feel tacked-on rather than organically connected to betrayal theme. Wedding motif's symbolic weight sometimes overpowers plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cleverly but not perfectly seamlessly—confetti proposals strain cohesion. The story's intellectual ambition outpaces its emotional grounding, creating slight thematic unevenness beneath the surface elegance.</comment>
