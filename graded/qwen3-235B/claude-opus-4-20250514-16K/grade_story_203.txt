<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc is clear but motivation—rebellion against inherited lies—lacks deeper psychological nuance. Marina’s fear and defiance feel established but not interrogated, her actions occasionally bordering on simplistic rebellion tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Efficient use of limited space; key turning in lock triggers the climax, which resolves through her toy’s revelation. Pacing is urgent yet compressed, risking emotional thinness. Beginning/middle/end cohesion achieved but feels mechanically structured rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Orbital debris as setting is visually striking but underexploited—the “metal cemetery” metaphor doesn’t fully integrate with Marina’s internal conflict. Sensory details (artificial light on wings, distant metal) evoke isolation but lack visceral immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elogantly subversive ending replaces dogma with tangible hope; mechanical angel symbolizes reinvention. Subtext about creativity vs. inherited falsehoods resonates. Somewhat reliant on tell-over-show with Marina’s emotions but compensated by layered imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids space opera clichés with exorcist-engineer twist. Character voice avoids overwrought prose but occasionally lapses into generic declarations (“small revolution”). Metaphors (e.g., “frozen screams”) are striking yet occasionally derivative of sci-fi dystopia conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements like toys and orbital setting are integrated with theme, though “defiant hush” as tone flattens nuance. Word count limitation is both a constraint and a strength, prioritizing lyrical compression over expansiveness. Lingering thought about authenticity is effective yet narrow in scope.</comment>
