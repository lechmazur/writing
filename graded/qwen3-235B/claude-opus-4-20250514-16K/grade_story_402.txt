<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Detailed, specific choices avoid clichés; the fusion of scientific rigour and mystical ambiance feels deliberately paradoxical rather than formulaic; voice maintains consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements merge conceptually rather than mechanically; brevity enhances the meditative tone; raises thematic questions that outlast their concise delivery.</comment>
