<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characterization is compelling but slightly underdeveloped; internal conflict feels authentic but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient bridge between ideological loyalty and transformation. Voice lacks distinctness despite introspective moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but sacrifices some pacing for thematic weight, creating minor tension between narrative momentum and philosophical exposition. Resolution feels earned but slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized through specific, symbolic details about thermal rifts and orchard biology. Atmosphere powerfully merges emotional and physical landscapes, though some sensory elements could be more sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (hermit crabs, orchard symbiosis) to convey theme. Ending resonates with layered subtext about adaptation vs. stagnation. Emotional impact emerges organically from imagery, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps but contains occasional ornate phrasing ("ephemeral rancor") that borders on self-importance. Subverts tradition-to-revolution trope through ecological lens, though certain descriptors verge on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elements combine with striking thematic synergy; each component reinforces the core conflict. Story feels intentional in brevity while leaving philosophical questions open-ended. Technical polish nearly compensates for slight character depth issues.</comment>
