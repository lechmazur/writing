<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are clear but underdeveloped; emotional stakes lack depth despite clever trait-plot integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot moves logically but feels compressed—key moments like Marcus/Chen's meeting lack tension development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven; workshop details and island memories mingle effectively, yet sensory elements rarely transcend serviceable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dialogues and imagery (e.g., "hammered repose") resonate, but deeper exploration of themes like moral decay remains hinted-at rather than felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; character voices feel human, but island-research-trope familiarity weakens its originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere, but the story plays it safe with assigned components rather than transforming them into singular artistry.</comment>
