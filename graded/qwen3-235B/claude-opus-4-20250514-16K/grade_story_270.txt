<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivation remains underdeveloped beyond repetitive ritual. Nuance in reactions to the globe exists, but lacks emotional progression across a century.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but suffers from compressed pacing. The inciting action and resolution are strong, but the middle feels rushed despite clear cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details create immersive atmosphere. Timeframe and location meaningfully enhance the theme of isolation, though the cartographer's backstory isn't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Uses literary devices effectively (origami time, "chrysalis" metaphor) with a resonant theme of bridging isolation. Tension is resolved satisfyingly, though subtext about cyclical longing could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rare lapses in prose ("eerie nostalgia...more real than reality") verge on purple prose, but inventive metaphors ("laughter of old friends sharing solitude") and emotional restraint save originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole with a haunting tone. The brevity emphasizes emotional economy, though greater thematic risk could elevate it further.</comment>
