<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Edmund’s stoicism remains performative rather than deeply internalized; his rebellion feels abrupt despite isolated hints of inner conflict. Motivation to defy conformity lacks layered psychological realism, relying too heavily on exposition (“whispered“parasite””) rather than behavioral nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but the rebellion’s execution lacks visceral momentum. Pacing balances subtlety with tension effectively, though the payoff feels muted—transformation of thirteen dioramas lacks concrete illustration of stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miniature-world details (infant-eyelash brushes, Victorian street景) create an oppressive, artificial beauty. Atmosphere enhances the thematic contrast between illusion and rebellion, though the orchard timeframe element remains underutilized atmospheric shorthand rather than integral motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of microscopic rebellion as radical truth reaches beyond surface plot. The scale of resistance—visible only to attentive observers—elevates the central conflict into a meditation on complicity and silent dissent. Finely wrought irony in the steward’s dual role as preserver/destroyer.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some striking metaphors (“lullaby of conformity”) and precise details, but self-conscious phrases (“cynical warmth,” “honestly rare moments”) veer toward thematic overexplaining. Sensory descriptions occasionally prioritize quirk over immersion (obsidian cameo’s “burning” coldness feels narratively performative).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Gestures toward literary ambition succeed, but coherence relies too heavily on the reader filling thematic gaps between assigned elements. Certain components (encrypted shipping labels, orchard gate) feel imposed rather than organically connected to the core metaphor of subversive miniaturization.</comment>
