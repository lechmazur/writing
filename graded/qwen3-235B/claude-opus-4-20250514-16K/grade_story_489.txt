<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to preserve tradition is clear and consistent, with her actions driven by ancestral responsibility. The observer's influence strengthens her performance, aligning with their role as a guardian of tradition. However, Maya lacks nuanced psychology beyond her duty, and secondary characters like the council remain flat. The plastic whistle's use feels logical but doesn't reveal deeper aspects of her personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whale's call initiates the ritual, and Maya's dance resolves the conflict—solid cause-effect chain. Pacing is tight within the word limit, though the rapid shift from demolition plans to salvation feels slightly rushed. The lighthouse's haunting and observer's intervention maintain internal logic, but the ending's swiftness risks oversimplification of stakes. Narrative arc remains complete yet constrained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tense maritime atmosphere (Atlantic's churn, whale's primal song) contrasts with the lighthouse's haunted interior. Sensory details like vibrating stone and ancestral resonance immerse readers. However, "brazen calm" tone lacks full cohesion—observer's contradictory traits aren't fully embodied in the setting. The haunted watch room's history is implied but underexplored beyond ritual significance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (whistle-as-tradition vs. demolition-as-progress) resonate. The dance as living argument against erasure evokes subtext about cultural memory. Ending evades sentimentality through physical phenomena (shimmering walls) rather than emotional telling. Ritual's mystical logic balances myth and human agency, though Maya's lack of interiority slightly weakens emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Haunting motifs are familiar, yet the plastic whistle's transformation offers originality. Some phrases ("ancient wisdoms," "harbor's wind") verge on cliché. The ghostly observer's intervention follows genre conventions without radical subversion. Emotional beats rely on imagery over nuanced character reactions, and the "town rally" resolution follows a predictable arc despite decent atmospheric scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements interlock cohesively (whistle compensates for stolen conch; whale's call as both plot device and symbol). The brief length serves thematic concision but limits secondary character development. Ending ties thematics together cleanly, though the observer's abrupt vanishing and council's change of heart feel under-earned for a literary showcase piece.</comment>
