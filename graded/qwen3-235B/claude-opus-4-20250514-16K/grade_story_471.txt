<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation (honoring grandfather) is clear, but "reckless hunter" feels underdeveloped; "meticulously careless" trait shapes her actions but lacks emotional texture. Flashbacks and artifacts (camera) reveal inner life but lack layered conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Slow-burn atmospheric progression works within constraints; mistiness and ghost-town navigation create cohesion. Arc closes on repetitive existential dilemma rather than resolution. Plot momentum relies on symbolic encounters rather than active events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Virtuosic sensory immersion in decaying amusement park establishes haunting tone. Foggy setting mirrors character’s fragmented memories. Atmospheric specifics (oxidized metal smells, fractured mirrors) elevate beyond generic hauntings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stylistic lyricism elevates emotional impact, but over-reliance on elegant abstractions ("calculated chaos," "conversations with musicians") weakens visceral engagement. Strong metaphor integration; theme of memory’s erosion resonates through imagery over plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on baroque overreach ("hanged men" Ferris wheel), yet most descriptions remain purposeful. Street musician motif risks becoming connective tissue rather than thematic spine. Emotions shown through environment more than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly organic despite some checklist-aspect in musician references. Tone remains consistent through lyrical gravity. Leaves haunting questions about memory but lacks narrative boldness that would distinguish top-tier work.</comment>
