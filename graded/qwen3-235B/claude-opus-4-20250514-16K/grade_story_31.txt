<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are compelling but underdeveloped; the orchardist's grief and Pixel's background are hinted at but not deeply explored beyond emotional convenience for the thematic framework.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pacing is tight and deliberate, but the abrupt revelation about the key's intentional placement feels under-prepared, slightly undercutting the narrative arc's smoothness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully rendered with layered sensory details (neon vs. organic quiet, bio-sensor data), creating a vivid cyberpunk world that authentically supports the story's themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through restrained showing (shared pruning, bio-sensor data) rather than telling. Subtext about loss and connection is clear, though the ending leans slightly toward sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by contrasting high-tech context with intimate human moments. Dialogue feels organic, though "excited restraint" occasionally verges on vague abstraction rather than lived complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements into a resonant whole, though the story’s brevity leaves some threads (parental absence, pandemic backstory) feeling like sketches rather than fully realized components.</comment>
