<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maya's motivation drives her actions, but the backstory of corporate betrayal feels underexplored. The hug with the girl reveals depth but lacks psychological resonance. Dialogue scarcity weakens voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on playlist discovery and mentorship arc, but marathon training as structural device feels underdeveloped. The beginning-end connection exists but lacks emotional payoff. Pacing drags in middle sections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (rust, steam, fog) create immersive decay. The ghost train's physicality mirrors Maya's fractured history. Atmosphere perfectly complements her mission's secrecy and the theme of preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "ghost train classroom" and "chalice" teapot add depth. The theme of cultural amnesia is clear but lacks subtlety in presentation. Conflict feels small-scale but resonates emotionally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality triumphs in playlist encoding and teapot symbolism. Avoids "sad mentor" clich√©s through action. No significant purple prose. Emotional nuance shown through steaming herbs and basket-sharing rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole without feeling forced. The marathon timeframe provides subtle structure while ghost train setting grounds the magical-realist tone. Leaves resonant questions about knowledge preservation.</comment>
