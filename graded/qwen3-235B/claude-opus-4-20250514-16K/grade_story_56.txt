<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cogent motivations and subversive actions are effectively established, but the swindler's dual role as documentarian lacks sufficient psychological depth. The reveal functions logically but feels rushed in execution within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative momentum through key actions (dropped book, computer activation), but the 500-word framework strains the plot's complexity. The transition from deception to truth-telling remains coherent despite compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Visually striking juxtapositions (apple trees in shattered windows) create atmospheric promise, but sensory details remain surface-level. The setting's thematic resonance—ruin transformed into survival—is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (mutated fruit as evidence, blank tags as subversive currency) elevate the narrative. Dialogue operates on dual levels, and the ending crystallizes the theme of truth's value. Subtextual richness justifies high score.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inversion: the con artist as truth-bearer and survivalist agriculture as evidence repository. Some descriptors border on mechanical ("gentle harshness"), but conceptual originality predominates.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Element utilization varies: price tag as communication system essential, invisible allies peripheral. The concise form feels intentional, particularly in maintaining tension between surface deception and latent revelation.</comment>
