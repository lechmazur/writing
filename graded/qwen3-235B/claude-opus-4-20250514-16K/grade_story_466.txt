<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character displays motivated curiosity and moral conflict but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but underexplored; "cunning" traits manifest through stealth but aren't fully interrogated thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc with purposeful symmetry (supermarket to tower), though some plot mechanics (xerograph machine discovery) strain credibility; pacing remains taut within constraints but resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective contrasts between mundane supermarket and arcane tower create atmospheric tension; strong sensory details in locations, but connection between grocery setting and broader worldbuilding remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., "biological time capsules") and paradoxical ending elevate theme of hidden histories; emotional beats present but surface-level, relying too heavily on authorial declarations vs. subtle characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes with inventive premise, though "lone genius discovers lost knowledge" framework feels familiar; prose remains purposeful with minimal embellishment, though some imagery ("whispering of forgotten cultivars") leans toward romantic convention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration superior to most but uneven; seed packets and xerograph masterfully utilized, while smoke tower and "elusive destiny" rely on underexplored connections; thematic cohesion partially achieved through strong prose.</comment>
