<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marina's linguistic ineptitude shapes her actions through dance but "sharp-witted" is inconsistently demonstrated; her inner monologue feels more fragmented than clever, undercutting character voice. Physicality as communication is strong, but cognitive sharpness remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot pivots on the mimicked photo choreography, but the twist about the hidden ship feels under-earned given the word limit. Pacing falters during reality-fluid chamber transitions; emotional beats about family denial get lost between conceptual weight and rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (burning patch scent, steam-warped photos) anchor the speculative elements. Chamber's porcelain tub as both sacred space and scientific lab creates productive tension. Atmosphere excels when blending cosmic stakes with intimate physicality, though temporal specifics of "bubble baths" remain underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dance-as-language motif delivers powerful subtext about alternative communication. The chamber's multiverse bubbles and "motion-reactivating-technology" are fresh, if occasionally overdetermined. Final twist lands as emotionally resonant rather than just clever, though some thematic repetition dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting space mission tropes (hiding in plain sight vs. grand launches) and using photo choreography. Verbal stutters feel authentic but occasionally overdone; sensory details occasionally veer toward poetic abstraction ("miniature universes") at the expense of specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively despite density. The family photos as hidden star charts and linguistic embodiment through dance demonstrate strong conceptual synthesis. Could benefit from more temporal anchoring of the "seven decades" denial period to deepen emotional weight.</comment>
