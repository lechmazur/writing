<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara's vendetta is clear, but her emotional complexity could be deeper; her transformation from vengeance to hope is underdeveloped in the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong cause-effect between plot elements, but pacing feels slightly rushed during the locket’s revelation and the shift to her counterattack; cohesion holds despite brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sugar glass, molten caramel) enrich atmosphere, but the “forgotten market” and rebellion’s scope lack grounding; the hidden continent’s worldbuilding remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (candies as evidence of atrocity) and thematic resonance (hope vs. vengeance) elevate the story; the ending’s mythic tone lingers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concepts like anonymous kindness and the hidden continent feel fresh, but the candy-as-code premise risks veering into whimsy; emotional beats are implied rather than shown.</comment>
