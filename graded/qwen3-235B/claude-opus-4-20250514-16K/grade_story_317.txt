<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unit-7's nostalgia drives her actions, but emotional layers feel superficially programmed rather than organically developed. Her dual "anxiously fearless" trait lacks integration with her mechanical nature, reducing psychological complexity. Betrayal as a motivator is clear but underexplored beyond surface pathos.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight pacing maintains urgency but resolution feels abbreviated. The crystal sabotage mechanism works logically yet the levitation field's destruction as solution seems undercontextualized. Dawn framing creates circularity but the plummeting climax lacks sufficient emotional weight vis-a-vis the facility's symbolic collapse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystalline caves contrast starkly against brass telescope's anachronistic warmth, enhancing existential decay. Failing levitation field's gravitational instability cleverly manifests rising tension. Dawn's "breaking" mirrors mechanical and human fragility. Atmospheric coherence exceptional but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Crystal etchings as "confessions" offer poetic subtext, undermined by melodramatic closure. "Brazen modesty" conceptually interesting but performs as narrative contradiction rather than thematic reinforcement. Emotional resonance compromised by over-reliance on abstract descriptors rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</question><comment>Excessive metallic metaphors ("crackling static almost laughter") strain credibility. "Whispering forgiveness" telegraphs emotion. Some fresh details ("air dissolving") compete with generic gravity field descriptions. Character voice oscillates between poetic and exposition-heavy, suggesting algorithmic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Elements combine effectively but not inextricably. Dawn's symbolic function outpaces mechanical integration; telescope's historical significance feels tacked-on. Emotional payoff is diluted by overly convenient 60-year-prepared solution. Premise holds lingering questions about artificial consciousness but execution leans on genre conventions.</comment>
