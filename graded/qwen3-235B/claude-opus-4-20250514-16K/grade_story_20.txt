<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped. The core conflict between past and present is clear, but motivations lack granular psychological complexity in such a short space.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structure is competent but constrained. The bridge confrontation provides necessary arc, but the cosmic timeframe feels artificially imposed rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through inverted waterfall details and celestial imagery. The setting's metaphysical quality enhances the existential tone without overshadowing narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical scaffolding (archery/journalism, upward water/downward regret) creates emotional resonance. The ending's thematic convergence of precision and purpose lands effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unusual combinations (war correspondent archer, upward waterfalls). Some cosmic metaphors teeter on familiar terrain but gain freshness through precise, unadorned prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock organically - comb as tangible past, bridge as conceptual pivot, celestial movements as narrative echo. The economy of language within constraints demonstrates exceptional compositional control.</comment>
