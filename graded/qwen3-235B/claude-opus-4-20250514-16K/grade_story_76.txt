<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the physicality of her stablehand background could be more deeply woven into her interactions with objects and environments. Her defiance feels archetypal rather than personally earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weak narrative arc; the discovery of "The stablehand's dream" lacks sufficient buildup or transformation. The film reel fire feels tacked-on rather than organically connected to her internal journey. Pacing uneven in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric details create a haunting, immersive environment. Fog, decay, and the carnival ship's decay mirror themes of censorship and hidden beauty. Sensory details consistently enhance mood and character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (banned words as fruit, silent orchestras) create philosophical resonance. Subtext about resistance through imagination is compelling. Ending lacks emotional catharsis but appropriately maintains thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in interpreting "dreams in ruins" and "warping" concepts, but some phrasing ("shyly unstoppable," "feral grace") borders on clich√©. Character psychology stays just shy of full human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated. The carnival ship and brass magnifier are essential, while "film clubs" feel accessory. Leaves an evocative afterimage but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
