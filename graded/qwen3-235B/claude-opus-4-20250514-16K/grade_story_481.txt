<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Underdeveloped core traits; the "cartographer" motif lacks integration beyond metaphor, and dragonfly's symbolic weight isn't fully earned despite its physical presence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak through-line between balloon loss and forge revelation; the conceptual leap between sterile medicine and ancient craftsmanship strains cohesion despite resonant ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory contrasts (sterile wards vs. sensual forge) work masterfully; the "tomorrow" smell of corridors and decaying dragonfly embody thematic tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense metaphorical tapestry (horseshoe as mortality relic, nanobots vs. forging) creates haunting subtext; ending's emotional resonance transcends slight melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some forced tech-poetry ("neural-glass") but avoids AI-adjacent clich√©s; emotional nuance in unspoken grief over synthetic eternity feels human, not algorithmic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition justifies element density; brevity amplifies existential questions rather than feeling truncated, though some connections remain underarticulated.</comment>
