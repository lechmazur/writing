<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear (using coral to save patients) but lacks emotional depth; cybernetic modifications enhance capability more than internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc (entry, retrieval, departure) but lacks tension or stakes; pacing feels slightly rushed in establishing consequences.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Cohesive despite tight constraints; elements serve the narrative, though the ending feels more like closure than resonance.</grade>
