<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's solemnity and scholarly focus are consistent but underexplored; motivations feel abstract rather than human-scaled, with minimal emotional interiority despite the poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mechanical progression through poems feels contrived at points; while the garden resolution thematically closes the arc, the tight word limit leaves insufficient room to earn the transformational revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile descriptions of the collapsed clock tower and impossible garden create immersive, haunting atmosphere where entropy and rebirth coexist symbiotically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors linking mechanical decay to organic adaptation are striking, though the theme of transformation occasionally veers into philosophical exposition rather than organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reversals like upward-rooting plants avoid genre clich√©s; language occasionally risks overly ornate abstraction but generally maintains purposeful strangeness rather than AI-like redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into the decaying worldbuilding, though the brevity prevents full thematic payoff; the ending lingers but lacks emotional piercing precision.</comment>
