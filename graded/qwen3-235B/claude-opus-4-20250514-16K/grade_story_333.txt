<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya's rebellion and motivation to preserve tradition are clear and consistent with her actions, but her internal conflict lacks sufficient depth beyond surface-level defiance; her voice is distinct but occasionally subsumed by exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is generally coherent with a clear arc, but the compressed ending feels rushed despite the word limit; transitions between physical exploration and thematic revelations lack smooth integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through visceral sensory details and metaphor ("living throat," "braided bitterness"), creating a haunting, immersive environment that directly serves thematic and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact achieved through layered metaphors and thematic exploration of tradition vs. evolution; the ending’s "courage to change" message is poignant but slightly undermines subtlety through explicit declaration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through fresh metaphors and psychological nuance; some phrases ("accumulated terror") risk melodrama but overall maintains originality through imaginative architectural symbolism and subversion of "hidden knowledge" tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion across confined form; combines tight emotional arc with conceptual richness, though the premise’s inherent complexity occasionally strains the brevity requirement.</comment>
