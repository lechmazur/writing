<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbols than fully realized entities; landlord lacks depth, protagonist remains passive and undefined beyond actions dictated by surreal premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot prioritizes conceptual exploration over structured progression; lacks tangible stakes or resolution despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is viscerally rendered through paradoxical sensory details (backward parades, humming pins) that amplify the narrative’s existential disorientation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (rooms "defying geometry," death forgetting its name) and recursive structure create haunting resonance; ending circles back with thematic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avant-garde tone and temporal fluidity feel fresh, but "weathered heart" borders on cliché; avoids predictability despite occasional ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Abstract cohesion achieved through obsessive thematic repetition; surrealism may polarize readers, but linguistic precision elevates its merit.</comment>
