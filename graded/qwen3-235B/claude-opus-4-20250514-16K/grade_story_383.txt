<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>General Harrow's transformation is abrupt but thematically cohesive; his voice and motivations shift logically once the camera's influence is introduced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc despite formal constraints; the camera’s role as a catalyst is seamless, though the ending’s abrupt joy feels slightly under-earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly imagined with vivid, original sensory details; the diner’s absurdity directly supports thematic concerns about liminality and shared human (and non-human) experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story’s metaphorical depth and subtext—fear’s patterned absurdity, the camera as a tool of epiphany—create profound emotional resonance; dialogue serves both character and theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality is high but occasionally undercut by overly stylized phrasing (“liquid starlight,” “cosmic rest stops”); metaphors are fresh but occasionally risk floridity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story feels intentionally concise, elements serve narrative cohesion; the synthesis of absurdity, character growth, and thematic clarity provides lingering philosophical weight.</comment>
