<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength in portraying Jian's arrogant exterior masking guilt and desire for redemption, but motivation tied to sister's sight loss could be more deeply explored. Dialogue reveals character truths effectively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clear through-line from request to authorization through song. Pacing is masterful in showing transformation between breaths. The cause-effect between song and calligraphy is poetically logical despite fantastical elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Stark visual contrasts between swordsman's violence and calligrapher's serenity create rich tension. Sensory details (trembling tapestry, ink scent) ground the spiritual themes in tangible reality. The courtyard as liminal space works perfectly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of dark spaces as wisdom rather than void is profound. Story shows emotion through tactile gestures (tapestry clenching, brushing paper) rather than stating feelings. The ending crystallizes the theme of non-visual mastery beautifully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids formula through unconventional metaphors (calligraphy as authorization, song as key). Minimalistic yet vivid language without excess adornment. Emotional complexity (shame beneath arrogance) feels human rather than calculated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically - the courtyard setting enables calligraphic logic, the tapestry's history justifies emotional weight, "between breaths" timeframe creates spiritual dimension crucial to the epiphany. Each element is organic to the thematic architecture.</comment>
