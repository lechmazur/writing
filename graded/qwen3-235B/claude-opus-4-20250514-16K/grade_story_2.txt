<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Transitions in Celeste's motivation from skepticism to humility are effective but lack sufficient psychological depth; her "brazen" voice occasionally feels inconsistent with her vulnerability. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot's compressed arc works within the constraint, though the cave's awakening feels rushed; the fusion of horseshoe to palm is logical but underexplained. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in the geode cave, particularly the olfactory details; the roller coaster metaphor disrupts otherwise cohesive atmosphere. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme of "knowing vs. unknowing" resonates emotionally, but some metaphors (e.g., "breathing starlight") verge on clich√©; ending succeeds but lacks subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery balances near-episodic structure; "peculiarly frequent" feels forced as an attribute, and dialogue remains minimal but purposeful; emotional nuance is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Engaging but uneven integration of elements; some components (e.g., geode cave, book-scent symbolism) elevate the narrative while others ("peculiarly frequent") create friction.</comment>
