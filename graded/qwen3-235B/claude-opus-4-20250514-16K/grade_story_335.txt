<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's shaky nature is established but underexplored; connection between her mercenary past and current motivation for understanding feels implied rather than demonstrated through specific memories or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum stalls in middle sections; reliance on exposition-heavy backstory weakens tension, while the cathedral's discovery feels abrupt despite tight word limits demanding tighter pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details about sound (echoes, spray cans), sight (murals), and touch (trembling hands) create immersive atmosphere; the "echoing hour" timeframe remains underutilized for thematic or plot purposes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (amber as remembrance, cathedral as confession hall) create emotional resonance; the ending's shift from absolution to witnessing reveals depth without didacticism, though grief feels generalized rather than personal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Amber altars" and "carefully reckless strokes" blend poetic style with narrative purpose, but phrases like "whispers in opium dens" echo genre tropes; emotional weight sometimes relies on abstract concepts rather than visceral specifics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (amulet guides quest, cathedral enables thematic resolution) but execution feels overly schematic; the brevity serves thematic compression but sacrifices character intimacy and plot logic.</comment>
