<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character traits like the blacklight constellations and magnetic compass create visual flair, but motivations remain surface-bound despite thematic weight; actions align with goals, but emotional depth lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory from rebellion to revelation, but thematic urgency outweighs narrative tension; polaroid-to-DNA logic drives momentum, while time crunch feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere blends science and myth (e.g., compass reacting to memory fields), but underutilizes sensory details; setting's synthetic biology elements feel generic compared to rich thematic undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (DNA as "stories written in nucleotides") and layered metaphysical-technology fusion impress, though emotional resonance leans on conceptual abstraction over lived experience; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original concept blends mitochondrial memory with archival photography, avoiding genre tropes; prose occasionally veers into ornate metaphors, but core ideas feel distinctly human and subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements interweave persuasively (compass as inheritance symbol, polaroids as ancestral portals), but slight seams show in squeezing scope into brevity; thematic cohesion elevates structural limitations.</comment>
