<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and integrated with plot mechanics, but emotional depth remains superficial beneath the concept-driven structure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Efficient plot compression with clear beginning/middle/end, but the sudden revelation about dragons and farming feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mechanically cohesive with clever element integration, though thematic cohesion occasionally feels prioritized over emotional urgency or deeper character interiority.</comment>
