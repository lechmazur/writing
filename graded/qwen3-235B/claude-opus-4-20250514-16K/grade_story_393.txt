<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters function as archetypes advancing the theme rather than fully realized individuals; Marcus’s motivation is clear but his emotional arc feels condensed, with Elena serving primarily as a plot device to convey exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing within the constraint is skillful, but the rapid chain of coincidences strains credibility; the connection between the butterfly’s emergence and the final revelation lacks sufficient buildup for full narrative satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid but unevenly layered sensory details (e.g. “tar pit’s obsidian surface”) create an intriguing atmosphere, though the suburban lab and fungal-lit watchtowers occasionally clash tonally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterfly transformation as healing, mycelial networks as kinship) resonate, but the emotional climax leans heavily on sentimental resolution rather than earned subtext or ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original use of alchemy-as-genetic-cure subverts expectation, but chain-reactive coincidences and the “dangerous knowledge fragmented for safety” trope lean on familiar structures with insufficient subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While conceptually cohesive, the story feels shaped more by checklist adherence to assigned elements than organic storytelling; some elements (e.g., neighbor’s ride) exist solely to enable plot mechanics.</comment>
