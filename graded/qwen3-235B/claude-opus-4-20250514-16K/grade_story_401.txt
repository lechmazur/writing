<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strength: Emotional arc of releasing inherited/guilt trauma is clear. Weakness: Wilderness background's influence on her decoding skills feels underdeveloped despite explicit mention of "translated bark patterns."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Tight structural symmetry between coffee ritual's start/end creates circular momentum. Weakness: Underwater decoding process oversimplifiedâ€”skips technical challenges that would make equalization metaphor more resonant.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strength: Sensory details ("algae-slick floor," "air pockets like inverse pools") create haunting fusion of decay and beauty. Weakness: Coffee consumption underwater strains believability despite "special valve" mention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: Symbolism of releasing both physical (ring) and conceptual (guilt) weights works powerfully. Weakness: Direct quote from ancestor's diary feels heavy-handed compared to subtle sensory storytelling elsewhere.</comment>
