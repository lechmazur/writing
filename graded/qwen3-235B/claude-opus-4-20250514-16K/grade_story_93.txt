<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation (sacred geometry pursuit) is clear and drives action, with unspoken bond with Marcus revealed through his betrayal/subterfuge. Nuanced emotional reactions to artifacts (trembling cards, radio tuning) but backstory and secondary characters remain underdeveloped despite efficiency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot follows tight crisis-escape-ambush-communication arc with elevator mechanics structuring tension. Pacing is efficient but resolution (uploading findings) feels perfunctorily inserted, weakening cause-effect chain for long-term consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory language ("glowing cards," "shimmering equations") and conceptually rich setting (sacred geometry archive) create layered atmosphere. Timeframe-intensified tension and spatial symbolism strongly reinforce themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (labyrinths as consciousness patterns, migration as prayer) and emotional subtext in gesture-based communication (card pass-through) generate persistent thematic resonance. The ending resonates conceptually despite narrative brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of biology/architecture/maths creates intellectual wonder without pretension. Avoids clich√©s in decoding system (12 decoders) and bittersweet closure. Some phrasing ("living mathematics") risks abstraction but serves thematic goals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into urgent, brainy escape narrative with emotional undercurrents. Technical details about migration patterns and labyrinth design elevate beyond pure escapism, though compression slightly dilutes character dynamics.</comment>
