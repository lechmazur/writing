<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maya's role as a tech-adjacent mystic has intriguing contradictions but lacks emotional depth; her past pain is mentioned but never viscerally felt. Motivations are implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Tight narrative frame from music hall to mess hall creates satisfying bookends; pacing balances backstory and action, though the transformation feels slightly underweighted despite strong causal links.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative decay of forgotten spaces mirrors digital detachment themes; salt circles and burning paper create potent tactile metaphors; the atmosphere is practically a secondary character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphor system (digital ghosts, analog wonder) is conceptually rich; ending resonates with melancholy triumph; shows tension through ritual details rather than existential monologues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Completely avoids AI fingerprintsâ€”specificity of '87 receipts, institutional despair, and secret club etiquettes feel human-crafted; avoids preaching while exploring a fresh cultural tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unique thematic prism; each component deepens the central tension; precise, non-arbitrary choices suggest authorial purpose rather than algorithmic assembly.</comment>
