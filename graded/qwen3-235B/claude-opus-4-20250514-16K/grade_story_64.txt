<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her obsession with immortality lacks emotional depth despite vivid actions. Internal conflict (uncertainty vs. resolve) feels implied rather than fully embodied through nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight causal logic and clear completion within constraints. The leap drives the arc, though the rushed backstory about mapping trails feels tacked on rather than organically integrated into the action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>World-building excels through rich sensory details (balloons’ creaks, floating canopy shadows) that evoke a cohesive, surreal atmosphere directly tied to character and theme. Overloaded with imagery but not incoherent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memorable metaphor ("wilderness mercy") and subversion of trial-to-execution tropes add depth. Ending’s thematic weight—sacrificing identity for transformation—resonates, though emotional resonance is partly undercut by detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids generic fantasy clichés via specifics (e.g., coded floor markings), but the "uncertain alchemist" concept leans on familiar tropes without fully interrogating them. Prose wavers between vivid and florid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity despite tight constraints; elements serve the narrative arc and amplify tension. The ending’s reflection on cost/ambition lingers, though some components (coded scuffs) strain credulity.</comment>
