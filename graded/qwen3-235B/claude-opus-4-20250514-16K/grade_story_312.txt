<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly developed; agoraphobia is demonstrated through setting but not deeply explored as a lived experience or psychological force. The snuffbox binds action to legacy, but emotional stakes feel compressed by word limit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but strained by brevity; the rain’s rhythm as method feels overly simplistic given context. Connection between beginning (agoraphobia) and end (freedom) lacks transitional nuance. Cause/effect in snuffbox’s destruction is abrupt despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through specific sensory details (humming sand, taste of desert air) and atmospheric contradictions (rain in desert). Desert rituals feel purposeful, though the "whispering dunes" lean on cliché. Timeframe device enhances tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling employs precise metaphors ("spider’s web drawn by unsteady hand") and evokes emotional resonance. Ending achieves thematic closure while maintaining ambiguity about Elara’s future. Subtext about inherited trauma is present but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in agoraphobia portrayal and magical realism. Some phrases ("terrible freedom") border on melodrama. Emotional nuance is mostly shown through physical reactions, but character interiority remains limited at crucial moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but occasionally feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. Breach feels deliberate in structure but constrained by word count; leaves lingering questions about the desert’s sentience that aren’t fully resolved.</comment>
