<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's grief and artistic drive are clear but motivations for her final leap lack deeper psychological nuance; emotional transitions feel conceptually poetic rather than earned through behavioral detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Obligatory 500-word arc functions coherently but relies on abrupt tonal shifts between melancholy and revelation; the ending's grandiosity strains the narrative's intimate scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Zero-gravity flora and cosmic dust create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details like "blue marble" and floating tears ground the ethereal concept with tactile precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Narrative economy works despite constraints—though not elevated by them; speculative elements feel purposeful rather than decorative.</comment>
