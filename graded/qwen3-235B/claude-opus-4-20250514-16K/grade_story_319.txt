<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is consistent but lacks depth beyond assigned traits; motivation is clear but pivotal emotional shifts feel abrupt</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but relies too heavily on predictable rebellion arc; climax resolves too neatly for a story aiming at literary complexity</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting details are evocative (tides, phial’s scent), but allegorical elements lean toward generalized symbolism rather than immersive specificity</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery and thematic coherence elevate storytelling; the phial’s dissolution as metaphor for systemic change resonates thoughtfully</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mixes fresh concepts (tide-bound rebellion logistics) with mildly clichéd "rebel vs. system" tropes; prose avoids excess but occasionally favors poetry over precision</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements work together seamlessly; tight word count enhances urgency; the metaphor of transient allegiance remains thought-provoking beyond the final line</comment>
