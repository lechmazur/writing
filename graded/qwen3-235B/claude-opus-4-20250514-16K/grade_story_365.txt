<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's existential paradox is well-defined and shapes her actions, but emotional progression feels more symbolic than psychologically nuanced; voice remains poetic but less individuated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot is tightly paced with clear cause-effect, but the surreal logic occasionally muddies the arc's clarity; transformation feels earned yet abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Richly textured setting merges metaphorically with theme; sensory details (scents, shifting visuals) deepen immersion and emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose amplifies thematic resonance; the interplay of loss and creation creates lingering impact, though symbolism occasionally risks overabundance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending cyclical time and tactile magic, but a few phrases (“melancholic glee”) feel constructed rather than organic to a human voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize with conceptual depth; the story’s brevity serves its mythic tone, though abstractness may limit broader resonance.</comment>
