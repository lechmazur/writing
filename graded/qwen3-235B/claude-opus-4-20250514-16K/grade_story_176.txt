<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through imaginative worldbuilding, though occasional lyricism borders on overwrought ("barbed wire arms")—balance teeters but ultimately holds.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally prioritize stylistic flourish over narrative efficiency; brevity both aids and restricts emotional depth.</comment>
