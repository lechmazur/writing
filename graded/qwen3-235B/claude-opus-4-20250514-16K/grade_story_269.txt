<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's existential purpose via quantum tailoring is conceptually intriguing but emotionally opaque; actions (stitching, merging) align with motivation but lack visceral personal stakes to ground the metaphysical premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure pivots on the mirrored doppelgänger conceit, but the compressed emotional arc between meeting and merging feels abrupt despite rich imagery; cause/effect logic holds, though conceptual momentum falters under the weight of abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steampunk aesthetic is viscerally realized through brass gears, aetheric resonators, and storm-battered windows, creating a tactile, layered atmosphere where machinery feels alive; sensory details (warmth of mirror, storm's metallic scent) deeply immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (stitching as reality-splitting) resonate thematically, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on grandiose declarations ("transcendence") versus earned intimacy; ending leans on poetics over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, genre-blending imagery elevates originality, though some phrasing veers toward lyrical excess ("writhe of shadows between worlds") that risks overshadowing subtle character nuance; avoids most tropes but occasionally substitutes complexity with mythic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack thematic integration—storm, mirror, and steampunk machinery serve as striking symbols more than narratively essential components; the transcendence finale feels thematically unearned despite atmospheric richness.</comment>
