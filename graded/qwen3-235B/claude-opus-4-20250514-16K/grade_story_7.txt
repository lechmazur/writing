<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional nuance; "expectantly resigned" informs her role but interiority remains distant despite well-defined cosmic responsibilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Static momentum with underdeveloped conflict; concept establishes cosmic stakes but lacks narrative progression within the constraint, feeling more like a setting sketch than self-contained story.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracks/healing) offer philosophical weight; "porcelain faces" as contrast between vulnerability/eternity effective, but emotional undercurrents remain partly told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion in tying nectar facility to cosmic healing but brevity leaves thematic potential under-realized; boundary-crossing motif suggests intriguing subtext left unexplored.</comment>
