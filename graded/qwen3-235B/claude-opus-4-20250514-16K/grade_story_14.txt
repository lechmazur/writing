<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation as a gambler clinging to hope is clear, but her emotional depth remains surface-level; her actions align with desperation rather than nuanced character traits, and her voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot’s cyclical gambling scenes drive tension, but the arc feels truncated; the connection between rising stakes and the decommission notice is logical but underdeveloped, and pacing in the final scenes lacks urgency despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal power station as a failing, candlelit setting is evocative; sensory details (wax, groaning turbines, salt-tinged air) create a palpable atmosphere of decay, and the timeframe of dinners contrasts ritualistic hope with encroaching oblivion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story’s subtext—exploitation, entropy—is compelling; the ending’s tragic irony lands, but dialogue occasionally leans on exposition. The central conflict (humanity vs. inevitability) is resolved through Marina’s tragic realization, though some symbolism (candles as fleeting hope) feels overly familiar.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but Professor Hendricks’ rants edge toward didacticism. The candlelit rituals and “last spark” motif are original but occasionally undercut by slightly mannered prose (“futile rhythm against the approaching dark”); emotional resonance is sincere but not entirely subtextual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>The story balances assigned elements with thematic cohesion, though the brief format leaves some elements (e.g., Hendricks’ lectures) feeling extrinsic. The ending’s lingering bittersweet resignation works well, but tighter integration of all elements could elevate publishability.</comment>
