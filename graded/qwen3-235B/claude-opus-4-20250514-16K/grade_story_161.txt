<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks layered development; Marcus's meticulousness aligns with his orchardist background, but his sardonic glee feels more like affectation than psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but relies on convenient revelations; the peacock-tail code decoding feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit, weakening cause-and-effect cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting serves functional purposes but lacks visceral sensory immersion; the sterile facility contrasts well with Marcus's visceral obsession, yet deeper integration of atmosphere with thematic tension is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphor ("victims like fruit") and tight thematic linking of pruning/revenge, but emotional impact is undercut by surface-level grief portrayal and overly explicit explanations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>While avoiding overt formulaic structures, the grieving avenger trope and "hidden code in symbols" mechanism feel derivative; the orchardist's-eye-view adds distinctiveness but only partially subverts conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Comprehensible and thematically coherent, but lacks lingering resonance; the ending resolves plot mechanics efficiently while leaving character and moral ambiguity underexplored.</comment>
