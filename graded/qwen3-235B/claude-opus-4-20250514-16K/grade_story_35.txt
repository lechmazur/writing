<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to understand emotional language through gardening/embroidery is coherent, though some internal contradictions (sudden first-person dialogue after prolonged silence) lack sufficient preparation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot progression through silent retreat and memory triggers is logical, but the structural pivot from gardener to translator feels slightly rushed. The circularity between beginning/end at translation center provides strong coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully combines concrete sensory details (embroidered texture, birdsong patterns) with abstract themes of language and memory, though the universal translation center's technical aspects remain underimagined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exceptionally poetic narrative with profound subtext about nonverbal communication. Metaphors (gardening as language, embroidery as emotional notation) work synergistically rather than feeling contrived. Ending resonates thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original handling of memory recovery through tactile processes avoids clich√©s. Avoids melodrama while maintaining emotional depth. Some ornate descriptions border on excess but remain purposeful within context of linguistic metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of required elements into cohesive whole. Every assigned component interrelates thematically, with the tension between verbal and nonverbal expression forming a sustained throughline. Brief format showcases precision rather than constraint.</comment>
