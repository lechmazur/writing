<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (sparking flames in ice) is clear but thinly developed; "earnest knight" traits are present but lack distinct voice or internal conflict that would elevate beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels compressed; astronomical map's role in discovery works logically but the resolution's speed undermines potential narrative tension from the desert journey.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create vivid atmosphere; desert decay and greenhouse's celestial alignment evoke a haunting beauty that enhances tone, though frozen homeland remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (Phoenix constellation, "canvas of life") adds thematic resonance; emotional impact undercut by reliance on explicit declarations ("tears stung his eyes") rather than deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some fresh conceits (greenhouse as observatory) but formulaic elements (mythical solutions to environmental crises) and overly tidy intergenerational connection weaken originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story cohesively uses assigned elements but prioritizes plot mechanics over nuanced character exploration; brevity serves the mythic tone but limits emotional resonance.</comment>
