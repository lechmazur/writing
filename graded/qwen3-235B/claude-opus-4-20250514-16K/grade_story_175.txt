<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Corvus' motivations are conceptually strong but lack psychological depth; his actions serve the plot's thematic goals rather than feeling organically human, with insufficient exploration of the personal stakes behind his lifelong pursuit.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tight structural framework with symbolic progression but relies on condensed exposition; the pivotal seventh night's events unfold logically, though the compressed timeframe limits emotional investment in the villagers' transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Packs thematic punch through conceptual elegance but leaves nuanced human elements underdeveloped; brief length amplifies poetic impact but sacrifices deeper character engagement.</comment>
