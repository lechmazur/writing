<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While Elena's leadership and Marcus's arc are competently sketched, motivations remain surface-bound—particularly Marcus's transition, which leans too heavily on familiar trauma tropes without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Concise but strained structural cohesion; the central negotiation feels compressed, with cause-and-effect relying on underdeveloped backstory about "first desperate months" that interrupts momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (tomatoes as memorials, cosmic balance as post-apocalyptic philosophy) elevates the narrative, though dialogue occasionally succumbs to expository weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but occasionally substitutes lyrical abstraction for concrete specificity—a balancing act in the margin between poetic resonance and vague generality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements combine with deliberate thematic synergy, particularly the spyglass as both legacy object and narrative device, though some plot mechanics remain schematic rather than organic.</comment>
