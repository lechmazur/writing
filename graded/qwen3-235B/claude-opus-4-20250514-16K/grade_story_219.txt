<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Character's fading status is established but remains static, lacking psychological depth or emotional evolution. Motivation to "map consciousness flows" feels abstract rather than rooted in specific human struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Folding the swan drives the plot but lacks tension or obstacles. The transition from action to dissolution feels abrupt, sacrificing narrative momentum in favor of poetic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Island's surreal qualities permeate every sentence; reversed clocks and shifting geography create a cohesive but under-explored metaphysical framework that immerses through uncanny specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Transcendent ending evokes paradoxical themes of loss and expansion. Metaphors (origami as cognition, swans as memory vessels) resonate conceptually, though some imagery leans toward abstraction over emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic prose but occasionally indulges in overwrought phrases ("whispers that sounded like synaptic firing") that border on literary affectation rather than immersive metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain under the weight of their own symbolism. The brevity amplifies the poetic concept while undercutting deeper exploration of the protagonist's humanity.</comment>
