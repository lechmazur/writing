<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character development is present but somewhat surface-level; her 'neutral passion' lacks nuanced manifestation beyond description, though the morbid fascination driving her motivation and transformation is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc—curiosity, exploration, epiphany—with logical progression. The cosmic concept drives the narrative, but pacing feels slightly compressed, slightly weakening the emotional weight of her internal shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating dojo and cosmic atmosphere are richly evoked through specific sensory details (crumbling pages, stargazing flowers). The setting’s surrealism directly enhances the theme, though its full physicality could use more texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ('flowers as punctuation in an eternal sentence') and lyrical prose deepens thematic resonance. The ending’s poetic clarity and subtext about cyclical renewal elevate impact, though emotional nuance has slight tell-don’t-show tendencies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés and combines floristry with cosmic philosophy in fresh ways. Some phrases ('neutral passion') risk abstraction, but the celestial floriculture concept and tonal consistency suggest organic creativity rather than formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative cohesively, with the florist’s background and cosmic themes deeply intertwined. The brevity feels intentional, and the story leaves a lingering philosophical impression, though some symbolic beats could resonate more deeply.</comment>
