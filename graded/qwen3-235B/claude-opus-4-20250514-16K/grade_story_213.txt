<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation is clear but underexplored; her identity as a "sentinel" feels more symbolic than viscerally embodied through action or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed for brevity, but the spore dispersion mechanics feel convenient despite strong thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae and repurposed bio-lab setting create immersive contrast; sensory details vivid but occasionally surface-level (e.g., "primal sophistication" lacks physical manifestation).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (stories as chemical code, forests as historians) resonate; ending resonates thematically but emotional depth remains abstract despite memorable imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept strained by occasional over-explanation ("modified chlorophyll storage"); "delightfully strange" feels both essential and underutilized as motif.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Story balances assigned elements effectively but unevenlyâ€”core themes shine while some connections (e.g., lab-to-restaurant setting) feel underdeveloped conceptually.</comment>
