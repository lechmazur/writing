<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is intriguing but lacks emotional depth despite unique traits; motivations are clear but not fully realized within constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively, though the condensed arc feels slightly compressed; thematic resolution aligns well with premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and atmospheric tension between ice/steam are masterful; setting itself is a character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and layered metaphors elevate the story; however, emotional payoff is somewhat diffuse despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh premise shows ingenuity but occasionally leans on familiar magical realism tropes; prose avoids excess but lacks sharper distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>Several elements impressively interlock but others (like forbidden logs) feel conceptually underexplored. Lingering thematic resonance is present but not fully optimized.</comment>
