<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks emotional depth; the twist about Marcus being a projection feels more like a plot device than a human psychological revelation. The mechanical degradation as punishment for victory lacks visceral impact</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clever twist structure but pacing issues - the revelation feels rushed from the sock's introduction to existential dissolution. Logical cause-effect between deconstruction and reality collapse remain vague despite coherent conceptual arc</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prismatic shadows and machinery-as-flesh decay create potent atmosphere, but lighthouse's thematic potential underutilized. Sensory details feel selectively vivid rather than consistently immersive</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors for self-destruction as philosophical achievement resonate. The sock deconstruction as self-unraveling is particularly effective. Ending lacks emotional catharsis despite strong conceptual payoff</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids obvious AI tropes with original conceits, but contains occasional purple prose ("coded desperation"). Marcus fabrication strains plausibility. Balance between abstraction and human psychology remains imperfect</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Coherent around core concept but shows seams under scrutiny. Some elements (hush/applause, lighthouse) feel half-integrated. Philosophical depth provides lingering contemplation but emotional connection remains elusive</comment>
