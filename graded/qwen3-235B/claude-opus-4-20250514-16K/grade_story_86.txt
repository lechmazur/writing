<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's anxiety is present but not deeply integrated into decision-making; motivation to "rescue truth" feels abstractly stated rather than viscerally demonstrated through layered internal conflict</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progression relies heavily on plot-convenient elements (candle triggering dormant sensors) and compresses critical revelations; coherent but strained by the tight word limit</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visionary atmosphere created through sharp contrasts of digital and physical elements, particularly server constellations vs candlelight; sensory details powerfully reinforce thematic tension</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic language and layered meaning elevate the narrative; emotional resonance weakened by direct statements about compassion and truth rather than more subtle exploration</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic elements with unique cyberpunk-mysticism blend; emotional nuances present but occasionally undercut by poetic abstraction that borders on vagueness</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unquestionably cohesive with its elements, but some conceptual scaffolding (like "across the bones" phrasing) feels thematically heavy-handed rather than organically developed</comment>
