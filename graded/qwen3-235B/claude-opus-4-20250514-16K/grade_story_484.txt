<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's actions lack internal conflict; motivations (values, activism) surface abruptly without emotional groundwork. Quippy dialogue flattens depth, making values-driven moment feel unearned despite thematic intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a surreal sequence (darkness vs. mirror) that disrupts the grounded protest setting. While ending ties to theme, the inciting step discoloration lacks narrative payoff, relying on metaphor over coherent cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting blends protest realism and supernatural horror unevenly—tombstones and thermoses clash tonally. Sensory details (e.g., "disappointed ancestors" staircase groan) lean on cliche rather than visceral immersion, weakening atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant use of allegory (darkness/gentrification) and ironic humor ("evil real estate developers"). The mirror's symbolic revelation lands, and the ending's "laughing protesters vs. darkness" juxtaposition succeeds as unexpected, resonant metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Occasionally veers into AI-written traps—awkward descriptors ("generically unique"), forced quips, and tonal shifts (from absurd to earnest). However, the protest/mirror fusion and "HOPS NOT CORPSES" satire show spark against formulaic horror tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story's ideological core (small business vs. consumerism) resonates, but structural seams show under 500-word pressure. Relies heavily on conceptual cleverness over cohesive character-world integration.</comment>
