<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits (sassy, rebellious, mischievous) that shape actions, but motivations (madness/liberation) lack emotional depth beyond conceptually driven behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot builds toward rebellion via gradual reality fracture but relies on compressed vignettes - momentum stalls in middle despite strong beginning/conclusion symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Office setting fused with cosmic imagery creates effective tension; inconsistent sensory details (e.g., specific smells of soup ingredients) would improve immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (calibration vs chaos) and self-aware tone create thematic resonance; ending's cyclical structure reinforces theme effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-tropes but contains some predictable emotional beats ("swirling cosmos of stories") and slightly overwrought phrasing ("culinary rebellion")</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but overall impact feels slightly constrained by formulaic rebellion arc rather than transcendent storytelling.</comment>
