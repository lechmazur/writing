<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Magdalene's transition from physicist to con artist is conceptually rich but underdeveloped; her self-reckoning via temporal echoes feels rushed despite strong thematic potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Temporal paradox drives the plot effectively, though the shift from lab accident to self-revelation occurs too abruptly to sustain full emotional resonance within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quantum lab setting is intriguing but underutilized; sensory details like the "crackling quantum foam" lack physical specificity needed to ground surreal elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of physics and spirituality avoids genre clich√©s, though some phrases ("laughter both bitter and joyful") border on mechanical sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-concept premise is masterfully executed thematically, but execution prioritizes idea density over fully realized character arcs or setting immersion.</comment>
