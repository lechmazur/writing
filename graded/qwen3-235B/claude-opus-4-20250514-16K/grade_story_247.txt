<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is vivid in imagery but motivation remains abstract. The poet's actions align with her symbolic role but lack deeper psychological complexity or personal stakes beyond thematic significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot achieves a complete arc through tight thematic cause-effect logic. The progression from confession-gathering to the compact discovery feels organic within the word constraints, though the ending leans heavily on expository resonance rather than earned climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Immersive setting with striking sensory details (smell of soil, starlight reflections, tactile bonsai textures). Atmosphere serves as active narrative force rather than backdrop, with power outage darkness functioning as intentional design rather than arbitrary device.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Multi-layered symbolism (breathe as literal/metaphorical map, confessions as cartography) creates profound resonance. Subtext about hiddenness and revelation connects seamlessly to form with minimal "telling." The ending lingers as both resolution and invitation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (confessions as coordinates, coffee cups as oracle bones) elevate this above clich√©s. Some poetic descriptions border on ornate but mostly maintain emotional specificity. The core concept feels human-crafted rather than algorithmic in its thematic precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Despite maximalist element usage, cohesion emerges successfully. Each assigned component contributes to thematic unity rather than feeling forced. The brevity works as an intentional canvas for implication rather than feeling unfinished.</comment>
