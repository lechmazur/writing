<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but internal transformation lacks sufficient nuance. The minstrel's passivity until the meteorite interaction shows limited development trajectory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence strong but reliant on contrivance (fortuitous ladle drop). Pacing manages tight word limits well, though the final departure feels abrupt despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere through vivid sensory details (cosmic texture, clattering platters). The giant's dining room's scale enhances emotional dwarfing, though some setting elements feel more symbolic than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (lute gathering dust, ladle as compass) elevate impact. The ending resonates thematically but emotional stakes could penetrate deeper. Effective showing of transformation through physical object interaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh use of cosmic motifs avoids fantasy tropes. Some ornateness risks purple prose ("gently thunderous" oxymoron), but metaphors mostly maintain originality. Emotional subtext shown through objects rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but depends on thematic elements rather than structural ingenuity. The metaphor-heavy style occasionally obscures narrative clarity, though final imagery lingers effectively.</comment>
