<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character motivations are hinted at but underdeveloped; Valentina's role as a heartbreak counselor lacks psychological depth, with Marcus feeling more like a plot device than a fully-realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Non-linear structure disrupts narrative flow; abrupt transitions between descriptive passages and dialogue undermine pacing; the ending feels unresolved rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Time travel elements are conceptually intriguing but underutilized; sensory details in the pool descriptions are strong but insufficiently connected to broader thematic concerns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coherence is strained by ambitious concept fusion; certain elements (tracking cloud trails) feel arbitrarily mandated rather than organically developed; leaves intellectual rather than emotional imprint.</comment>
