<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is consistent but underdeveloped. Loyalty to her mentor drives action but lacks nuanced internal conflict; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through layered introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent structure within constraints, but the leap from decoding jokes to moth-encoded sequences strains credibility. Pacing is economical but occasionally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pervasive atmosphere of eerie transformation through flickering lights and chaotic moths. Sensory details are evocative but occasionally overwrite the setting’s realism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking use of juxtaposition (sacred geometry in comedy, control in chaos) creates thematic resonance. Ending lacks emotional closure but succeeds as a provocative transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visionary concept execution with fresh metaphors (moths, humor-as-code). Occasional abstraction risks alienating readers but avoids overt clichés or tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements function collectively but unevenly. The tower and outage anchor the narrative; some conceptual glue between comedy-coded wisdom and moths feels tenuous.</comment>
