<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; the "meandering" trait feels more like a surface quirk than a defining characteristic shaping actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has forward momentum but feels compressed; circular structure (beginning/end of silence/healing) functions but lacks emotional payoff for the broader setting's potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Evocative setting undermined by underdeveloped sensory details; the "fractured idyll" between literature and liquor has conceptual richness but remains superficially treated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Puppet subversion creates powerful metaphors; "teeth as truth-tellers" is emotionally resonant; dialogue functions as thematic throughline rather than naturalistic exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Style oscillates between vivid metaphors and excessive ornamentation ("warmth radiated like a campfire in winter"); some phrases border on clich√©d romanticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mix of poetic conceits and thematic consistency earns merit; the metaphor of unread texts as emotional paralysis remains strikingly memorable despite uneven execution.</comment>
