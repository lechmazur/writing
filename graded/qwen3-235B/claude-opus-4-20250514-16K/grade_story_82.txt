<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise establishes Mira's reluctance and analytical nature but lacks emotional grounding for her rapid transformation into acceptance. Motivational shift feels underdeveloped despite initial consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Exposition-heavy middle section bogs pacing, but cyclical structure (inherited burden → discovery → transcendence) creates satisfying conceptual throughline within tight constraints.</comment>
