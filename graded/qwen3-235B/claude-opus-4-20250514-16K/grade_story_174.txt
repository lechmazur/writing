<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character is emotionally driven but lacks layered internal conflict; motivations are clear but not deeply layered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is elegant but the resolution feels abrupt; emotional stakes could be more thoroughly earned within the compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visionary setting details (library’s smoke-like shelves, frost’s crystalline logic) create a hauntingly tactile and symbolic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (fireworks as flawed legacies, frost patterns as fate’s malleability) resonate thematically; ending achieves poignant, non-formulaic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Some imagery risks ornateness (e.g., "ancient as erosion"), but subversion of regret-as-transformation avoids cliché; emotional subtext feels earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Elements (fireworks, frost, leaves) unify under time’s duality; the narrative’s philosophical core elevates structure beyond gimmick.</comment>
