<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are intriguingly described but lack emotional depth; his "weird staticness" feels more symbolic than human, motivations are clear but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres to tight structure (problem, demonstration, resolution) but lacks complexity; pacing is efficient yet the arc feels slightly shallow due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere with evocative details (swirling souls, recycling currents); setting directly enhances mood, tone, and narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors, thematic resonance about memory/identity, and layered subtext elevate impact; the ending’s cyclical structure reinforces the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive concept and specific imagery; tone remains consistent, emotional beats are implied rather than stated, and language balances poeticism and clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>All assigned elements merge seamlessly into a cohesive whole; style enhances clarity, the concise length feels purposeful, and the story’s theme lingers beyond the page.</comment>
