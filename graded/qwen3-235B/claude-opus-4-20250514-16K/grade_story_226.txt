<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's desperation to preserve beauty is clear, but her gloominess lacks depth beyond surface traits. Motivations are consistent yet underexplored psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses through contained action with logical steps, but the ending feels abrupt; connections between setting and arc are present but underdeveloped despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (desert vs. sterile facility) create immersive atmosphere. Timeframe's poetic phrasing enhances mood without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (sound as resurrection, orchards as memory) resonate. Subtext about art surviving destruction elevates simplicity. Emotional impact is quiet but purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements; each serves the theme. Lingering questions about lullabies' future use suggest depth, though closure feels intentionally minimal.</comment>
