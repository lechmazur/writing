<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (survival vs. duty) and aligned with aristocratic background, but emotional depth feels surface-level; internal conflict lacks nuanced exploration despite high-stakes decision.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves a circular structure (financial desperation to symbolic rebirth) within constraints, but pivotal moments like the roller coaster's activation lack buildup; pacing balances action with reflection but resolution feels overly neat.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grimwood’s decayed grandeur, synesthetic details (fog, creaking machinery), and botanical-arcana create visceral atmosphere; setting functions as both thematic anchor and supernatural engine, though temporal distortions remain underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language (chains/wings; recipes as "living" text) and symbolic progression elevate the narrative; emotional impact derives from sensory specificity rather than exposition, though the thematic conclusion veers toward neatness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés (botanical coding as family legacy is inventive) but occasionally leans on Gothic tropes; character reasoning remains humanly plausible, though the final choice feels insufficiently complicated despite strong prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Assigned elements synergize effectively—abandonment, legacy, and motion intertwine—but lean into familiar "last heirloom quest" paradigms; brevity sharpens focus while leaving thematic implications underdeveloped.</grade>
