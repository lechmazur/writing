<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is well-motivated, but her twin Lila lacks depth beyond plot function; hired actors exist only as props rather than revealing character nuances through interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Basic three-act compression works, but pivotal transitions feel abrupt (summit chamber's sudden appearance, timeline erasure) and the apocalyptic prophecy's introduction strains narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Certainly visual (crystal shadows, market contrasts), but atmospheric elements like sensory details beyond sight remain underdeveloped, creating a half-realized physical world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory-as-burden theme resonates; the final choice to embrace ignorance shows moral complexity through concise gestures and baseball symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (twin destiny, time travel pitfalls) but occasionally relies on poetic description to mask under-explored emotional logic; tone remains consistent throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements form a functional skeleton, but forced integration (farmers market, time traveler mechanics) outweighs organic development; ending's philosophical weight feels unearned.</comment>
