<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations stem from plot necessity rather than organic development. Mika's transformation feels abrupt and undermotivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Pacing issues disrupt structure—transitions between encounters feel arbitrary. Loose connection between beginning and resolution weakens cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Repurposed highway setting with decaying yet regenerative trees creates powerful, specific atmosphere. Sensory details immerse readers in the post-dreamscape.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echoes of lost wonder evoke melancholy. Effective symbolism around cyclical decay/regrowth, but emotional payoff lacks visceral specificity for profound impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original setting and concept resist genre templates. Occasional clichéd phrases ("frequency only the dreamless could hear") and predictable plot mechanics regarding notebooks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</comment>Story synthesizes elements into an atmospheric whole but relies on familiar mythopoetic structures. Lingering questions about reality vs. metaphor lack sufficient narrative grounding.</comment>
