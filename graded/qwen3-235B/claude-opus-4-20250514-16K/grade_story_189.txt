<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has consistent traits (literal, calm) that influence her actions, but lacks deeper personal stakes or evolution. Emotional resonance remains surface-level despite skillful integration of assigned traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical with clear beginning/middle/end structure and cause-effect chain. Some key plot points (anonymous notes, frequency modulation) feel underexplained within tight constraints, slightly undermining cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like glowing algae, humming capacitors, and spectral whispers immerse readers in post-apocalyptic lighthouse atmosphere. The setting's decay mirrors Earth's ecological collapse but could better integrate war-for-water timeframe.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imaginative symbolism (star maps as hope, ghosts as past knowledge) elevates narrative. Ending delivers thematic depth about human survival through innovation rather than scarcity, though emotional catharsis remains muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story avoids genre clich√©s through scientific ghost reinterpretation (EM echoes) and non-linear mythbuilding. Some overly poetic descriptions occasionally tip toward extravagance without losing narrative clarity completely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Idea of celestial migration as solution to climate collapse offers fresh metaphoric resonance. Elements combine organically within tight word count though some atmospheric connections remain unexplored.</comment>
