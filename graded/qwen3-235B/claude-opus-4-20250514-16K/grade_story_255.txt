<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits coexist unevenly; the seer’s extraordinary gift and ordinary appearance contrast well, but her analytical innovation feels underexplored. Motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth, making inner conflict underdeveloped despite the theme of justice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tightly structured within constraints; the plot flows logically from party cover to data decryption. Scene transitions are seamless, though the scent-triggered revelation strains plausibility slightly. Resolution feels earned but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful—confetti as “colorful ghosts,” petrichor’s supernatural connection to the USB password. Sensory details immerse readers, with setting and tone enhancing the theme of buried truths resurfacing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Excellent use of literary devices: “innocent cynicism” crystallizes the character’s duality; “mythic relic” redefines documentary evidence. Ending resonates thematically, though subtext about truth’s endurance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original integration of supernatural and procedural elements. Avoids most AI clichés, though petrichor’s symbolic convenience borders on contrived. Emotional nuance in the seer’s quiet triumph avoids overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite constraints; every element serves the narrative. The twist of “mythic relic” as digital evidence is intellectually provocative. Ending lingers thematically but lacks visceral emotional impact.</comment>
