<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth behind Magnus' transformation; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance. Character traits hinted at rather than fully dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on conceptual leaps rather than organic cause-and-effect. The arc is present but occasionally undermines momentum through exposition-heavy developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting possesses striking visuals but insufficient sensory immersion. Atmosphere leans on concept over lived-in details that would validate its thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (e.g., femur chandeliers as literal/metaphorical illumination) elevates impact, though some thematic statements border on overt moralizing rather than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally relies on familiar speculative tropes (visions of war, ancient secrets). Voice remains distinctive despite sporadic overwriting in atmospheric passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Barely achieves cohesion under tight constraints. Conceptual ambition outpaces execution in balancing multiple fantastical elements against character development within the word limit.</comment>
