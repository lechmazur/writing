<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment> Vera's ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are implied through actions but lack deeper exploration of her inner conflict or vulnerabilities. Motivation tied to inherited duty is clear but thinly contextualized, with reactions to the comb feeling more symbolic than visceral. Dialogue reveals wit but not layered character voice. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment> Plot follows a clear trajectory toward decoding the petroglyphs, but tight pacing leaves resolution feeling abrupt. The comb's use as a cipher drives the climax logically, though the 19-minute race lacks tension. Cause/effect is mostly coherent, but the stone circle's significance is underdeveloped. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment> Misty stone circle and radio static create vivid atmosphere, effectively tying the mundane (scuffed comb) to the mystical. Timeframe ("pause between verses") cleverly mirrors thematic urgency. Sensory details (flying gravel, spiral carvings) enhance mood, though the setting’s historical weight feels underexplored. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment> Subtext about subverting authority and preserving hidden knowledge enriches the narrative. Metaphors (comb as cipher) and symbols (flowers as cover for rebellion) are inventive. Ending ties to grandmother’s legacy with thematic resonance. Pacing limits emotional depth, but the voice balances poetic precision with dry wit. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment> Original premise avoids clichés (flower arranger as codebreaker). Language remains purposeful despite lyrical passages, and the twist of the comb as a key feels fresh. No purple prose; emotional restraint (showing via actions over exposition) enhances authenticity. Minor tonal shifts (e.g., abrupt tour group reminder) are forgivable. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment> Elements mesh cohesively (comb as heirloom/tool, stone circle as narrative/conceptual linchpin), though the "polite anarchy" trope is somewhat conventional. Style balances clarity with lyricism, and the short form serves as a sharp vignette rather than a constraint. Lingering questions about the watchers’ full history suggest intentional thematic openness. </comment>
