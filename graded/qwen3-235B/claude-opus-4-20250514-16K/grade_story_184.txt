<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Distinct voice but underdeveloped psychology; sarcasm substitutes for depth, though the tavern-hand's gritty irreverence creates engaging first-person tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractured timeline works as plot device but occasionally strains logic; backward causality maintains coherence despite compressed word count, though some sequences feel rushed or under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with sensory paradoxes (reverse-evaporating oceans, breathing vacuum gardens) that transcend mere ornamentation to shape character and concept alike.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Provocative metaphors (shells humming with "reverse entropy") and high-concept humor elevate the narrative, though emotional stakes remain abstract despite technical virtuosity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids time-travel clich√©s through surreal inversion; however, ornate phrasing ("temporal arithmetic") sometimes overshadows thematic clarity, borderlining on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Excellently compressed narrative maintains momentum despite fantastical premise; all elements feel purposeful though some conceptual layers demand more unpacking than word count allows.</comment>
