<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but not deeply explored; motivation is implied rather than demonstrated through concrete reactions to obstacles. The assignment's core traits feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mechanical progression of ritual anchors the plot, but lacks narrative stakes or meaningful conflict. The tight structure serves the word limit but sacrifices emotional urgency. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually arresting atmosphere through precise, unexpected details (porcelain eyes "like secrets," moonlight refracted into rainbows). Setting operates as a living character. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with layered metaphors creates poetic impact, though some phrases verge on ornate abstraction. The thematic resonance of empathy bridging loss through physical ritual is powerful. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally relies on atmospheric shorthand ("dolls frozen mid-reverie"). Inventive in its fusion of machinery and emotion, though some cadences feel self-consciously literary without deeper emotional excavation. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor and cohesive aesthetic, but psychological and narrative minimalism leave emotional questions underdeveloped. Memorable but risks feeling like a polished vignette rather than self-contained narrative. </comment>
