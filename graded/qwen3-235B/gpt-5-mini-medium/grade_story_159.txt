<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's symbolic traits are consistent and drive plot mechanics, but psychological depth feels abstract and distant, lacking visceral emotional grounding despite lyrical integration of motives.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is conceptually cohesive with clear arc, but compressed execution leaves resolution slightly underdeveloped; cause-effect logic is sound yet pivotal transformation moments risk feeling narratively abrupt</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting operates as living metaphor through tactile sensory details (cardboard crown, confetti texture) and spatial-poetic imagery (floating lanterns as consciousness analogues); atmosphere becomes character in itself</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Concepts form organically unified whole where each element serves thematic spine; compression enhances rather than hinders resonance; closing image crystallizes philosophical vision effectively</comment>
