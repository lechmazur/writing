<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character traits are poetically interwoven with actions and environment, but lacks emotional urgency; motivation to confront the mirror is clear but remains abstract rather than viscerally felt through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure implies a ritualistic arc, but pacing loses narrative momentum in abstract prose; transformation climax feels inevitable rather than earned, with cause-effect logic obscured by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crystal fortress and rainbow canyon create an immersive, distinctive atmosphere, though some details (singing walls) seem decorative rather than functional to plot or theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully synthesizes fantastical elements into a cohesive mood piece, though the brevity prevents full exploration of philosophical implications suggested by the mirror confrontation and immortality.</comment>
