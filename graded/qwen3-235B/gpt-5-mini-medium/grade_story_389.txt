<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Warlock's thin-lipped formality and hunger for knowledge create visual texture but lack emotional interiority or psychological complexity; motivation is clear but flattened into archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot moves with lyrical inevitability toward ritual, but brevity sacrifices momentum; transitions between object manipulation/coherence feel compressed rather than fully earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is lushly oppressive—a mine that "returns appetite" through coal dust and sutured texts; atmosphere of forbidden scholarship rendered through tactile details (ledger ink taste, fragment hums).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting imagery ("marginalia signed by hands long gone") and subtext about knowledge-as-consumption elevate the craft; ending lacks emotional resonance beyond cryptic flourish.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in merging academic obsession with alchemy, though "forbidden artifact" tropes are slightly predictable; metaphors (warlock as hungry engine) feel fresh but verge on over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Elements strain for symbolic cohesion—overpacked with motifs (calendar clocks, discredited cures) that don't fully coalesce into a singular resonant vision.</grade>
