<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rendered through metaphor but lacks psychological depth; motivation to quell rebellions (inner/outer) connects to actions but remains abstract. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite third-person omniscient; trauma-as-mapping metaphor dominates over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No traditional plot; repetition and atmosphere replace progression. Coherence emerges through thematic loops (rituals quelling chaos) but lacks causal momentum or arc. Ends with same equilibrium, weakening narrative satisfaction despite poetic intention.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly evocative: crystals as "captive moons," fungus whispers, velvet darkness, and rebellious constellations create mythic unease. Sensory details (tactile sand, visual light refractions) immerse while echoing emotional themes. Timeframe of stargazing frames ritual cadence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (trauma as "enumerated geography," grief as "fragmenting raids") elevate impact. Ending's "quiet revolutions" ties subtext to universal resilience. Shows through ritual engineering rather than stating emotions; poetic language occasionally risks becoming self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in trauma qua mapping; avoids sentimentality. "Multiply singular" and "stargazing" as timeframe feel conceptually forced. Some phrases verge on abstraction ("whispering fungus") but generally subverts tropes with mandalas as emotional hydraulics. Style prioritizes lyricism over naturalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</comment>Story's elemental cohesion is admirable but unevenâ€”the tube, mandala, and trauma interlock while timeframe/attribute feel secondary. Leaves readers with existential questions about emotional containment but sacrifices narrative urgency for tone. Stylistic ambition exceeds structural necessity in places.</comment>
