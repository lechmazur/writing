<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivations are intellectually conveyed rather than emotionally embodied. Traits like "dizzyingly grounded" are stated rather than demonstrated through tangible actions. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot moves through poetic imagery rather than causality. Jigsaw structure of concepts creates thematic coherence but lacks traditional narrative progression. Ending feels conceptually earned but emotionally diffuse due to condensed form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly realized with vivid sensory details (ash smell, cracked mirror reflections) that merge metaphor and physicality. Setting enhances theme through synesthetic blending of scientific and ritualistic elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Profoundly metaphorical language creates layered resonance - breaking cycles as both ecological act and existential quest. The mirror's reflection of "dozen possible homes" crystallizes the paradox of belonging. Conceptual depth occasionally overwhelms emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through bold juxtaposition (lab vs. ritual). Occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction but maintains originality in fusing botany with ceremonial reinvention. Emotional nuances emerge through tactile gestures rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High-concept cohesion elevates it above formulaic writing. Assigned elements create tension rather than feeling forced, though some aspects (shattered porcelain masks) seem conceptually underdeveloped relative to the plant motif.</comment>
