<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are stated but not deeply demonstrated; motivations are abstract, not fully revealed through actions; emotional engagement is limited by surface-level exploration despite poetic description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Plot is atmospheric but lacks clear progression, causality, or resolution; cyclical repetition substitutes for structure, and the "stolen moment" framing doesn't compensate for the absence of measurable narrative stakes or payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (hum of printers, smell of glue, chipped tile's symbolism) strongly immerse readers, but the cohesive atmosphere doesn't fully bridge the story's lack of plot momentum or character cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphorical depth (e.g., "folded line breaks into private jokes") elevate impact, but themes of tradition/future lack sufficient emotional or narrative weight; ending feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes with original metaphors ("kaleidoscope design studio," "chipped tooth oracle") and thematic ambition, but abstract execution occasionally veers into pretension; tone remains distinct despite some overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose and innovative imagery coexist with unresolved tensions; lacks narrative urgency or character depth to elevate it beyond fragmented poetic vignette status.</comment>
