<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's traits shape mood but emotional depth remains superficial; motivations tied to prophecy fear lack visceral urgency despite lyrical introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression works through poetic logic, though final escape relies on under-explained mechanics; tight structure elevated by recurring physical/spiritual architecture motifs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory coupling of organic (nacre, tide) and constructed (gears, blueprints) elements creates hauntingly immersive psychogeography; setting actively shapes both character and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering of architecture as both salvation and constraint creates thematic resonance; ending functions as both literal action and existential surrender, elevated by rhythmic, incantatory prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exceptional originality in conceptual blending, but occasional over-reliance on adjective clusters ("sharp gentleness") and abstract theological phrasing risks distancing readers from visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Every element contributes to the story's puzzle-box architecture; while some connections require reader interpretation, the cohesion between form and content feels intentionally labyrinthine rather than haphazard.</comment>
