<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (preserving tradition) is clear but internal conflict underdeveloped; actions like clutching a coat button symbolize deeper grief, but first-person voice lacks distinctiveness, rendering emotional resonance superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a pivotal choice, but the coffee stain interpretation feels abrupt; pacing balances brevity with tension, though some cause-effect transitions (e.g., symmetry of buttons) strain credibility within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport evokes decay through specific details (oil, rain); "flying library" imagery is vivid, but "fractal sorrow" and cosmic metaphors occasionally overwhelm atmospheric coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (coat buttons, library as "ark") and thematic subtext about collective memory; however, themes like "unity through reading" are declarative rather than dramatized, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise and metaphors ("paper maps" for emotional repair) avoid clich√©, but some phrases ("spiritually secular") feel conceptually vague; emotional beats are shown through objects (letters, buttons) rather than stated outright.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements (coffeestain divination, library-ark) merge cleverly but strain under thematic weight; the ritual's significance feels forced at times, yet the closing cathedral metaphor lingers memorably.</comment>
