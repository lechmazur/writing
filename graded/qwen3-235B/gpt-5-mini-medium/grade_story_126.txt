<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric and symbolic but lacks interiority; motivations are implied through action but remain abstracted, never fully transcending metaphor to reveal a human core.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from introspection to ritualistic rebellion, though the momentum falters briefly during the ascent description; resolution is conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting relies on sci-fi clichés (holograms, space stations) without engaging their implications; the post-tree world is referenced but never viscerally rendered through sensory specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Brilliantly layered subtext conflates ecological collapse with artificial solace; imagery (butter churn vs. holograms) and symbolic action create piercing emotional resonance without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in juxtaposing anachronistic objects with sterile futurism; avoids most AI defaults through precise, thematically charged metaphors and resistance to narrative platitudes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wealth of assigned elements overwhelm cohesion; many feel like aesthetic choices rather than narrative necessities, particularly the spaceship, butter churn’s functional relevance, and dissonant tone.</comment>
