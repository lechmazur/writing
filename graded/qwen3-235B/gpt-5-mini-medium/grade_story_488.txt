<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's abstract motivation lacks emotional grounding; actions are symbolic but disconnected from tangible behavior. The summoned "spark" never reveals a coherent psychological reality beneath the metaphors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Rhythm replaces narrative; poetic accumulation of images substitutes for cause-and-effect. The "conclusion" evaporates without resolving tension between imitation and creation. Word economy sacrifices structural clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visceral synesthesia – "rust and applause," "smell of warm copper" – creates immersive paradox. Quantum beach fused with demolition site produces frictive atmosphere that deepens thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphor density dazzles but obscures emotional stakes. The filament's "replicable light" offers conceptual punch missing in character dimensionality. Too many phrases prioritize lyricism over narrative logic (e.g., "tide ticks").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("corroded rapture," "domestic alchemy") but vocabulary often becomes self-indulgent ornament. The "family in condemned block" feels tacked-on rather than organically imagined. Tension between invention and reflection remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Style overwhelms substance; the story feels like mood board rather than narrative. Each element glows individually but fails to ignite collective combustion. Formal elegance cannot compensate for underdeveloped emotional/psychological stakes.</comment>
