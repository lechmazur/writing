<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s guilt and redemption arc are consistent, but profession as wilderness guide remains largely decorative rather than integral to his motivation or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot has cohesive circularity through coffee ritual and ring, but internal monologue-heavy progression occasionally stalls momentum within tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken ballroom’s eerie visuals and tactile details (coral, lumps in blanket) vividly enhance mood and theme, though some metaphoric connections require reader inference.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and layered metaphors (blanket as diary, ring as reconciliation) evoke emotional resonance, though ending’s transcendence risks vagueness over concrete impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avant-garde imagery occasionally veers into self-indulgence (“chandelier sang with tide of small reconciliations”), but subtext-rich handling of guilt and obsession resists formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Story excels in poetic cohesion, but the wilderness guide element feels loosely tethered to the underwater setting, creating a subtle fissure in believability.</comment>
