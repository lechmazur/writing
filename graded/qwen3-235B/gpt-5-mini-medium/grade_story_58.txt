<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character’s "fierce loyalty" remains abstract; internal motivations blend meditation with vague "storms" without grounding in tangible experiences or past context. Interactions with the journal feel symbolic but lack emotional specificity or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from solitary meditation to communal teaching, but progression feels haphazard—external outage and character’s internal states aren’t clearly causally linked. Resolution is implied rather than earned through narrative beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moth observation tower’s atmosphere is richly rendered (ozone smell, moth-wing texture), and the blackout heightens tension. Setting and tone merge to create haunting immediacy, though some details verge on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery (moths as "punctuation," breath-counting as bell-rhythm) elevates the narrative. Ending balances quiet triumph with lingering vulnerability, avoiding sentimentality. Subtext about collective resilience vs. individual discipline resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some phrases ("liturgy of warning") lean into poetic density rather than precision. Sensory details (embossed journal, ozone) avoid cliché, but "sanctified dread" risks being overdetermined. Emotional beats are shown but occasionally opaque.</comment>
