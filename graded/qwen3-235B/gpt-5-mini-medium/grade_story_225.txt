<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is motivated by unconventional love but lacks deeper exploration of psychological nuance; actions align with traits but personality feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot driven by Morse code and butterfly tracking, but resolution feels abrupt within tight constraints; cause-effect logic holds but pacing uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine setting is vividly rendered with sensory details; timeframe of broken treaties enriches political undertones but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Richly symbolic language ("moth scales as teleglyphs") elevates thematic depth; ending resonates with subtext of reconciliation through mapped longing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in apothecary's methods and steampunk-fantasy fusion; avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize cohesively (e.g., treaties mirror fragmented love), though brevity limits full thematic exploration; rewards reflection.</comment>
