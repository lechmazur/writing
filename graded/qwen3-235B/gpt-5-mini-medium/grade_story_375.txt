<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is a poetic concept rather than a psychologically nuanced figure; motivations are thematic vectors (beauty of imperfection, channeling wrath) rather than human impulses, but their symbolic coherence offsets partial lack of emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No traditional plot arc—replaces narrative momentum with thematic progression; relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than cause-effect logic, which works for mood but weakens structural tension in the constrained form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Radiant, immersive atmosphere—transmitters humming with "kindness," mannequins whispering through creaks, gorge-breath becoming code—all sensory elements serve the melancholic, urgent tone and the theme of fractured beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with original metaphors ("botanist of storms," "luminous circuits") and subtextual layering of sabotage as both destruction and care; lacks visceral emotional grounding despite stylistic virtuosity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in framing sabotage as "surgical kindness" and mannequins as archival mechanisms; occasional ornate abstractions ("ruin as rehearsal for renewal") risk obscuring specificity, but tonal consistency salvages authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive within its symbolic framework, but abstract themes outweigh narrative urgency; the experimental structure feels intentional yet risks alienating readers seeking emotional stakes over poetic abstraction.</comment>
