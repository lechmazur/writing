<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's indifference is superficially maintained but often contradicted by actions; motivation is implied but not fully explored; reactions to objects gesture toward depth without achieving emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; ritual progression substitutes for plot but creates cohesion only through repetition rather than cause-effect dynamics; narrative arc remains amorphous despite poetic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery creates lingering resonance; subtext about memory and renewal emerges subtly; elevated prose occasionally risks becoming self-indulgent but still reinforces thematic tension between creation and erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through esoteric vocabulary but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction; metaphors like "slow geometry" show ingenuity but sometimes obscure clarity; emotional nuance implied rather than dissected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; setting strongest component; thematic unity compromised by abstract characterization and amorphous narrative focus; poetic ambition exceeds structural execution.</comment>
