<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (mapping trade routes) are consistent with "kitchen table wisdom," but the orchardist remains an abstract, mythic figure without internal contradictions or emotional depth. Actions align with "trustworthy unique" trait, but the character voice lacks distinct idiosyncrasies that would ground his personality in the sensory world.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from entering city hall to map-making to spectral negotiation, but lacks discernible rising/falling action. The "reclaiming" action is abstracted into metaphysical gestures rather than concrete stakes. Pacing feels static, more a mood piece than a story with momentum. The multiverse concept complicates cause-effect logic rather than clarifying it.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Underwater setting is vividly rendered through tactile details (salt-grit pencil, anemone-encrusted columns, phantom mayoral seal hum) that evoke memory-as-physical-force. The decaying bureaucracy juxtaposed with living marine growth creates eerie atmosphere that enhances the theme of resurrecting obsolete systems.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story achieves poetic resonance through metaphors (maps as "grieving tree roots," barter chains as "servers of worlds"). The spectral negotiation scene adds thematic weight about bureaucracy outliving civilizations. Subtext about healing through reconnecting severed networks feels profound despite minimal plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in merging orchard grafts with multiverse cartography. Avoids cliche through tactile specificity ("phantom hand touch" avoiding ghost tropes). Some phrases flirt with over-wrought abstraction ("servers of worlds"), but the mayoral seal's "municipal regret" demonstrates fresh anthropomorphism of systems.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically but risks solipsistic abstraction without stronger emotional anchor. The elements serve a unified vision, but the density of metaphor and thin character voice might limit broader resonance. Formally daring but straddles line between depth and obscurity.</comment>
