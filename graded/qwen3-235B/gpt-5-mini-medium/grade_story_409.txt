<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are hinted at through abstract metaphors rather than concrete actions or decisions; motivation to "extinguish self-deception" lacks visceral, grounded emotional stakes despite lyrical language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Circular structure using the sculptor's chisel moment as a framing device creates cohesion, but the 500-word arc compresses internal transformation too abruptly to maintain narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Attic's clockwork animals and oil/stardust sensory details create haunting atmosphere; setting enriches thematic concerns of fractured time but sometimes feels like mood-driven set dressing rather than narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density (shards as truth; machines telling "small honest noises") delivers profound thematic resonance; ending achieves catharsis through symbolic action rather than plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Largely avoids AI clich√©s with original imagery (foxes as "practice in posture"), but over-reliance on compound modifiers ("precise ruin") and conceptual repetition risks ornamental overload.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Cohesive in its poetic logic, but the brief's required elements occasionally strain narrative flow; some details feel conceptually additive rather than organically integrated.</comment>
