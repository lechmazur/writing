<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's wistfulness and motivation are clear but static; lacks internal conflict or evolution, serving more as symbolic archetype than fully-realized individual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structures itself around cumulative acts of rebellion, but lacks dramatic arc despite cohesive thematic progression. The "between acts" structure limits emotional momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Cyberpunk elements feel superficially aestheticized—ozone and holo-ads dominate, but setting fails to deepen emotional or thematic stakes beyond atmosphere-as-contrast clichés.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Prose glimmers with metaphoric precision; the blacksmith's quiet revolution is rendered poignant through synaptic imagery that binds mechanical decay to organic endurance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions; metaphors ("myth root in concrete seams") and character voice remain fresh. Only faint trace of ornamental phrasing mars otherwise fiercely original synthesis of tech/nature tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Strong on poetic cohesion but underdeveloped in emotional stakes—feels like a fragment of a larger thesis rather than a self-contained narrative revelation.</comment>
