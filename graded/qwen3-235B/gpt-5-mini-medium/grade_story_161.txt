<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character depth exists but feels selectively rendered; motivations (personal tragedy, distrust) are implied through obsessions but lack emotional interiority. The seal and peacock patterns serve character logic but sacrifice deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Linear progression undermined by compressed chronology; key narrative leaps (connecting flight data to conspiracies) lack earned dramatic build. The thematic symmetry between flight patterns and betrayal is intellectually satisfying but emotionally underpowered.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes pastoral and mechanical elements awkwardly; atmosphere oscillates between forensic and mystical without full synthesis. The peacock’s visual splendor contrasts with the sterile facility but sensory immersion remains partial, relying on visual shorthand rather than cumulative details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion in linking biological design to bureaucratic falsification rewards close reading. The interplay between organic patterns and human deceit creates compelling subtext. However, the ending’s "workaday vengeance" lands as abstract defiance rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging orchard botany with cryptography logic. The peacock eye-crease parallels risk absurdity but avoid AI-like predictability through meticulous analog metaphors. Some ornate phrasing ("quiet weight of a past," "practical curing") borders on self-indulgence but overall voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambition exceeds execution; the conceptual marriage of agrarian tradition and bureaucratic skepticism fascinates, yet the truncated mystery resists full thematic gestation. The elemental framework operates at cross-purposes—each device works individually but strains coherence collectively.</comment>
