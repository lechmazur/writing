<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Faintly drawn inner conflict; the tailor's motivation to sculpt new futures exists but lacks psychological depth or emotional specificity. The restlessness manifests through actions but never fully defines his persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Meandering structure prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum; the connection between the storm incident and broader thematic arc feels vague rather than tightly engineered.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a tactile Martian biodome atmosphere, though the interplay between irrigation plans, bookshop, and tailor's work remains conceptually porous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hauntingly poetic execution of metaphor-as-survival-mechanism, with subtextual layers about hope's transactional nature. Ending crystallizes thematic coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Meticulously constructed metaphoric architecture avoids clich√©, though occasional flourishes ("cautious abandon") strain toward conceptual density at the expense of rhythm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant prose sustains interest but uneven integration of assigned elements creates impression of parallel thematic explorations rather than unified whole.</comment>
