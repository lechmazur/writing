<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations (chronicling social movements) feel grafted on rather than driving action; "disappointment" and "anxious calmness" manifest through ornate descriptions but lack psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot substitutes poetic abstractions for causal progression; "confrontation" lacks stakes or transformation; inverted waterfall setting and unplanned stop feel randomly juxtaposed rather than structurally integral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere has potent surreal imagery (upward water, "celestial dance") but inconsistent sensory details - relies too heavily on metaphorical abstraction over tactile reality to maintain immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Craft demonstrates strong literary ambition with metaphors like "passionate disinterest" and "records as communal" but struggles to connect emotional subtext with narrative momentum; ending's thematic resonance feels forced rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids AI clich√©s in setting/concept but occasionally dips into overwritten imagery ("slow beads like reluctant planets") that prioritizes style over emotional authenticity; "tarnished silver comb" as motif works well but other elements strain for significance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Coherence fails to unify assigned elements into a purposeful whole; surreal conceits overshadow thematic aims; memorable for language rather than structural ingenuity, with ending feeling schematic rather than revelatory.</comment>
