<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional dimensionality; motivations are symbolic but underdeveloped. Actions align with traits, but psychological nuances remain superficial despite the poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot's metaphorical arc resolves cohesively, but its abstract progression and reliance on thematic revelation over concrete stakes weakens narrative urgency within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underwater setting and decaying machinery create vivid, immersive atmosphere; sensory details enhance mood. However, the world feels more symbolic than pragmatically lived-in.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor (stamps as boundary-erasing acts, quilt as defiance) elevates the narrative; the ending resonates thematically. Emotional impact is implied rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids generic tropes via unique imagery (postal borders blurring) but occasionally risks pretension ("objectively biased ledger"); tone remains consistent yet occasionally opaque due to ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but rely heavily on metaphor overload; the quilt and stamps serve deeper meaning but overshadow narrative immediacy. The ending lingers conceptually but feels structurally sparse.</comment>
