<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Promises under armor and weary resolve imply depth but lack concrete emotional triggers; defiance is hinted but not fully embodied in actions beyond retrieving the ledger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Meteor-following and ledger discovery create a thematic arc but lack tangible stakes; pacing is slow, resolution feels abrupt despite strong symbolic closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Floating monastery offers vivid imagery but remains underutilized worldbuilding; incense, metallic sounds, and meteor sensations build atmosphere but their thematic connection feels uneven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (compass uselessness vs. trusting intuition) and subtext (apathy as armor) elevate the narrative; ending lands with quiet poignancy but lacks visceral emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate abstraction ("sky writing its route"); metaphors like "stolen blade" carry weight but tonal consistency wavers slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion around small acts of rebellion exists, but premise's fantastical elements aren't fully interrogated; memorable for tone rather than structural innovation.</comment>
