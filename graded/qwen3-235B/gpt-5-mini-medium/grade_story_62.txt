<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic, motivations (rewriting existence) stated more than demonstrated through actionable choices; voice has poetic consistency but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular structure with "final goodbye" repetition creates thematic cohesion but lacks traditional plot progression; meandering narrative prioritizes atmosphere over momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orchard amphitheater and sewer origins offer vivid contrasts; sensory details like sap/silence create immersive mood but occasionally verge toward overwrought symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Profound metaphoric layering (code/superstition, fear/curiosity) elevates theme exploration; lyrical prose and subversive lullaby structure make the conceptual feel visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resists formulaic structure; metaphors feel fresh (chilling stories as ethical catalysts). Slight overuse of adjectives/adverbs detracts from otherwise daring abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock conceptually but some (philosopher's sewer-dwelling) feel optional; story's brevity enhances mystery rather than constraining meaning.</comment>
