<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth; character motivations are poetic but underdeveloped. Actions remain abstractly symbolic rather than revealing humanizing detail.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambient tone overshadows plot progression. Begins and ends with atmospheric loops rather than a concrete arc, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</comment><comment>Visually rich setting with vivid analog/digital decay, but sensory details occasionally lapse into generality rather than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking prose elevates the piece, but emotional resonance is dampened by over-reliance on metaphor at the expense of human-scale stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by overly ornate phrasing and recurring metaphors that feel manufactured rather than organic to thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Individual elements impress, but cohesive synthesis falters. Requires further excavation of psychological or thematic bedrock to transcend poetic fragmentation.</comment>
