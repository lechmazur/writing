<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s pliancy and grief-seeking motivation are hinted but lack psychological depth; reactions to the owl/photographs don’t fully reveal interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Premise (influence via photos) sustains a mood but lacks narrative tension or clear progression toward a resolution within the compressed form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, oppressive atmosphere with visceral sensory details; setting shapes emotional and thematic undertones but occasionally overwhelms narrative focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language, symbolic cohesion (tears as transmission, owl as liminality), and thematic resonance elevate the craft, though occasional abstractions risk opacity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery occasionally veers into self-indulgent prose; thematic originality undercut by repetitive syntactic cadences and over-conceptualization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong stylistic cohesion and thematic ambition, but uneven pacing and abstract progression may limit broader market appeal despite literary merit.</comment>
