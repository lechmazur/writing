<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motives and consistent actions, but lacks inner conflicts or evolution; her "literally figurative" nature is described but underexplored through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Focused on static worldbuilding over plot progression; beginning and end mirror each other, creating cohesion issues despite thematic resonance within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and evocative setting merges the futuristic and tactile, with loud silence and star charts amplifying thematic tension between memory and erasure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyric prose, layered metaphors (thimbles as memory-seams), and subtext about loss elevate it; emotional impact emerges through associative resonance rather than plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evasive of clich√©s with thimble-archived storms and rideshare poetry; avoids overwriting through precise, purposeful imagery, though some phrases (e.g., "loud silence") risk abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements serve theme without redundancy; brevity deepens conceptual focus. Aestheticized melancholy occasionally overshadows emotional urgency, but leaves lingering questions about preservation.</comment>
