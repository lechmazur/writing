<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character is mythologized but lacks depth; motivation is clear but abstract, actions allegorical rather than rooted in psychological realism. Assigned traits inform poetic gestures but not a fully realized persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot implied rather than structured; poetic progression over narrative momentum. Resolution feels thematic but underdeveloped. Coherence is present but lacks tension or dramatic arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory precision; industrial decay juxtaposed with artistic defiance creates memorable mood. Setting as character, though sometimes overwhelming narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery and musical metaphors enrich the story’s philosophical undercurrents. Subtext about cultural preservation resonates, though emotional engagement is filtered through abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise with risks; some phrases verge on baroque overwriting but avoid pure formulaic repetition. Tension between mechanization and artistry feels fresh, even if occasionally overstylized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements serve the story’s lyrical thesis but strain plausibility. The brevity works as a canvas for metaphor rather than narrative economy, leaving a resonant but incomplete emotional impression.</comment>
