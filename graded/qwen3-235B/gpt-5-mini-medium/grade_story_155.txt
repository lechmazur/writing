<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is a vessel for concept but lacks emotional depth; motivations (regret, control) are abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Vocational specificity as an underwater welder remains decorative, not defining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot prioritizes poetic abstraction over causality; button box's use lacks stakes or consequences. The narrative hinges on thematic echoes rather than coherent progression from decision to tension to resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting achieves vivid surrealism—broken planetarium/nightclub juxtaposition is immersive, enhanced by sensory details (sound as "tidal breath"). Atmosphere overshadows plot integration, though.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery resonates (e.g., timelines as frayed seams), but emotional impact is diffused. The theme of choice vs. determinism emerges through metaphor rather than character engagement, hindering narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While metaphors (e.g., "tidal breath") avoid cliché, prose sometimes lapses into mannered abstraction ("ghost booth"). Tension between clinical precision and mysticism creates originality, but some phrasing risks becoming self-indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively into a mood piece, but the lack of concrete stakes or clear transformation undermines publishable urgency. Stylistic ambition succeeds, but narrative weight falters.</comment>
