<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivations (healing, war reparations) are intellectually coherent but emotionally distant; his connection to the coded letter lacks visceral stakes beyond abstract moral reckoning. The "gracefully awkward" trait is thematically consistent but remains surface imagery rather than behavioral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic gestures (ossuary rituals, decoded letters) rather than actionable stakes; tension between healing and hidden agendas dissipates into abstraction. Pacing balances lyrical pauses with episodic beats but fails to crystallize moments of decisive transformation within the constriction of the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gothic-meets-gastronomy setting is vividly realized through sensory motifs (bone broth liturgies, skull-laden arches) that mirror thematic contrasts. Atmosphere sustains a haunting yet ironic tone, though occasional overreach in grotesque elegance threatens immersion (e.g., "conspiracy of bone").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical density ("bandaging with lumberjack hands," "comfrey as military tactic") creates haunting subtext. Ending avoids pat resolution by framing care as ongoing subversion. Some lyrical flourishes risk obscuring narrative urgency, but sustained paradoxes (healing vs. exploitation) provoke lingering unease.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Subverts war/healing tropes through culinary-military parallels; metaphors avoid clich√© but occasionally strain plausibility (diplomats bartering recipes for battalions). Emotions are shown through gesture (flinching at "comfrey") but some conceptual abstractions dilute human complexity in favor of allegory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically coherent skeleton but lack muscular tension; certain components (nightmares, bike rides) feel like symbolic scaffolding rather than organic narrative. The ending's ideological pivot feels earned but more intellectual than emotionally resonant.</comment>
