<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corin’s traits are vividly articulated, but his “peaceful anger” and “amiability” lack grounding in active conflict; motivation to restore the kingdom feels poetic yet under-dramatized, leaning on abstraction over tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure emphasizes lyrical rhythm over plot momentum; charity drives and ledger entries create repetition rather than progression, while the “hydrolysis” motif drives thematic coherence but weakens narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, merging firefly-lit rituals with tactile details (jars, ledgers), though the “breeding grounds” and kingdom blueprint remain conceptually distinct worlds rather than integrated settings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (hydrolysis as societal repair, petals as votes) resonate with haunting precision; thematic unity is strong, though the ending’s “map of grief” risks over-explaining an otherwise impressionistic meditation on legacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally border on self-indulgence (“slow mathematics of chance”), and the “peace-laced anger” line feels contrived; subtext is rich, but inconsistent compression of ideas may suggest algorithmic abstraction over human rhythm.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</comment>Story coheres thematically but sacrifices narrative drive; the brevity feels intentional yet occasionally cramped, with subtextual depth compensating for minimal character or plot evolution.</grade>
