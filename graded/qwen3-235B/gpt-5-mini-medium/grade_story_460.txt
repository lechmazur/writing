<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character traits are symbolic rather than psychologically complex; motivation is clear but abstract, more philosophical than human. The monarch’s actions align with his role as a symbolic figure, but individualized emotional depth is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot is a mosaic of vignettes with no traditional arc; coherence comes from thematic repetition. The story’s brevity constraints are respected but resolution feels more implied than earned, leaning on poetic resonance over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visceral, immersive setting details dominate (acid rain, glass-like trees, corrosive jewels) and amplify the story’s themes of fragility and regeneration. Atmosphere is the story’s strongest pillar.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush symbolism (ember of choice, feather as metaphor) and lyrical prose elevate the story. The ending ties back to the monarch’s role as a guide, though emotional impact leans on the reader’s willingness to engage with abstraction over specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality is high: the acid rain forest, prismatically destructive environment, and non-traditional monarch avoid tropes. Only minor overuse of oxymoronic phrasing ("lethargically energetic") slightly distracts. Otherwise, tone and style are distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are deeply interwoven with theme and atmosphere, but the story’s cohesion relies more on poetic juxtaposition than plot mechanics. The brevity enhances the reflective tone, though some may find the lack of narrative stakes limiting.</comment>
