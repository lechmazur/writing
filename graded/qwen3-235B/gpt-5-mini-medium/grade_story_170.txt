<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's inner conflict is evocative but occasionally veers into generalized melancholy without sufficiently anchoring her specific fears or scientific expertise; the "free-spirited herbalist" duality feels conceptually thin despite lyrical execution</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot substitutes emotional resonance for action, creating cohesion through motif repetition (stitching, coral) but lacks tangible progression; the "heart of doubt" arc is atmospherically conveyed but structurally amorphous</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion (salt-slick concrete, faded ink's blue) meticulously constructs a decaying liminal space where marine science and personal decay intersect; every element from coral tanks to tide-stained trunks amplifies the theme</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric symmetry between biological restoration and psychological mending resonates through meticulously controlled prose; some phrases ("hollow echoes of shame") risk poetic abstraction over narrative weight but generally succeed in emotional evocation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally strains toward poetic density—some metaphors ("small animal that nibbled courage") verge on forced anthropomorphism; emotional complexity emerges through subtext rather than exposition</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>All required elements are symbiotically interwoven, particularly the coral station's scientific decay mirroring emotional states; would benefit from sharper narrative stakes to complement its textual texture</comment>
