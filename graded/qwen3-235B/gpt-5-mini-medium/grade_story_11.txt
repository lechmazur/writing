<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits are stylistically emphasized but lack deep psychological complexity; motivation is clear but its evolution remains underexplored, with internal conflict only implied through abstract metaphors like "serene anger" rather than embodied actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows with poetic logic but lacks narrative urgency; the structure's symbolic resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, though the 400-word arc maintains coherence through recurring motifs rather than conventional cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly immersive worldbuilding through tactile details (grease stains, crooked brushstrokes, light-play on folded paper) creates a palpable atmosphere where esoteric ritual and mechanical labor collide with visceral authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stunning interplay of symbolism and subtext elevates the story beyond its narrative; the stitched map as legacy-text becomes a profound metaphor for documenting human connection without erasing its fragile, handmade nature. End's visual metaphor lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on poetic overload ("linearize beliefs and borders"), but overall the voice balances lyrical depth with precision; emotional subtext emerges through objects rather than emotional tells, though a few adverb-heavy passages dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize with near-alchemical synergy; the story transcends its components to articulate a philosophy about authenticity in representation and the intersection of sacred tradition with lived materiality. Brief length feels architected, not constrained.</comment>
