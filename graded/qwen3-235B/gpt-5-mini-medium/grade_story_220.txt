<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Weak character interiority; aloofness and curiosity remain superficial. Motivations (reclaiming power, reconstructing truth) lack emotional anchors. Development feels external, driven by plot mechanics rather than organic human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing issues in constrained space: crucial moments (ledger discovery, citywide impact) feel rushed. Plot mechanics (logbook revelations, "wounded season") introduced but underdelivered. Cause-effect chain solid but resolution lacks narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Shipping containers as active metaphor for archival memory. Fossilized salt, copper smells, and neon-rust contrasts immerse but occasionally overreach. Atmosphere overshadows character, yet perfectly crystallizes the "lull" and "innovative nostalgia" elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("porpoise ink," "containers as ledger") elevate craft. Subtext about erasure/reclamation is present but underexplored. Emotional impact muffled by stylistic density; showing dominates telling but sometimes becomes abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original imagery strained by formulaic phrases ("wounded season," "innovative nostalgia" as checklist terms). Occasional purple prose ("archive of summers and winters") undermines authenticity. Subverts some tropes (non-hero protagonist) but leans on "lone truth-seeker" archetype.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel engineered for symbolism over narrative urgency. Breach of official records and human-scale restoration resonates, yet emotional stakes remain intellectualized. Ambitious vision constrained by word limit.</comment>
