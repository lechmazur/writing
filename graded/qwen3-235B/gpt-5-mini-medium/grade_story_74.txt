<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's minimalist ethos and defiance of AI are clear but underdeveloped; motivation is consistent but remains abstract rather than emotionally grounded. The aloofly intimate trait lacks concrete behavioral examples.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through ritualistic acts and coded sequences with lyrical momentum; non-linear time frame is cohesive. The opening and closing create circularity, though some transitions between imagery and action border on poetic abstraction rather than narrative cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pre-landfall timeframe and sterile Study Center create haunting contrasts; sensory details (salt flats, circuit boards) and metaphors ("stenciling data into graphs") immerse readers. Tone blends mechanistic clinicality with occult symbolism, though the primordial setting's full narrative potential remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Prose wields metaphor ("Fibonacci seams in knitting") and subtext ("machine-made world") masterfully; ending's resonance lies in the anti-AI exodus being both literal and philosophical. The conflict between human unpredictability and algorithmic control is intellectually and emotionally provocative within the story's scale.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in its fusion of paleontological and cybernetic imagery; avoids clich√©s via idiosyncratic phrases like "practicing analog silence." Minimal purple prose; emotional nuance is implied through oblique gestures rather than stated. The risk of overly abstract phrasing is offset by conceptual boldness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements are interlaced with thematic precision (cards=resistance, tide=change). The experimental structure feels intentional, prioritizing mood over conventional plot. Leaves a lingering meditation on incremental rebellion's power, though the brevity risks leaving some connections implicit rather than fully articulated.</comment>
