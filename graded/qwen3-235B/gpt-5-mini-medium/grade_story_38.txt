<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and poetic vocation define his actions but remain superficially explored; motivations (non-violence) are clear but lack psychological complexity; reactions to objects hint at deeper themes without full emotional embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plots flows through recurring rituals rather than a traditional arc; resolution feels abrupt yet thematically purposeful; assigned action/method integrate well but lack narrative complexity; pacing balances poetic reflection with structural vagueness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting permeates tactile details (whispers in piping, static-dense rafters); botanical samples and subway interstices create liminal realism; sensory motifs (vinegar, pressed fern, coffee-sour dawn) build immersive, mythic ambiance supporting core concepts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose fuses metaphysical inquiry with concrete imagery; metaphors (confessions as tinctures, silence as solvent) resonate thematically; subtle subtext about language's reparative power emerges; ending achieves poetic resonance without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echoes of Gothic tradition and AI-style recursive patterns exist ("empty abundance," "meticulously messy") but are counterbalanced by original structural choices; emotional nuance surpasses algorithmic clich√©s, though occasionally overwritten; voice remains distinct if occasionally arch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually despite occasional thematic redundancy; brevity feels intentional to reinforce cyclical rituals over narrative incident; style enhances theme while occasionally obscuring urgency; leaves intellectual rather than emotional haunting.</comment>
