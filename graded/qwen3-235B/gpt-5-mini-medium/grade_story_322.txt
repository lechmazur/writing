<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pitched on rationally whimsicality without revealing psychological depth; motivation explained more than demonstrated. Character consistency maintained but lacks emotional complexity beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eddies of action substitute for cohesive plot progression; episodic structure weakens narrative drive despite strong central metaphor. Repairs and measurements lack consequential stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</comment></grade><comment>Lush atmospheric details (ink-smelling ledger, chiming pebbles) create dreamlike immersion but setting remains a poetic abstraction rather than active force shaping events.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical scaffolding impresses (interconnectedness embodied through physical measurements), particularly in childâ€™s laughter-weeping duality; occasionally overexplains thematic elements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Resists genre tropes through lyrical abstraction but occasionally slides into ornate vagueness ("ink-licked margins"). Emotional nuance implied through objects rather than direct expression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coherent but fragile synthesis of elements; conceit wears thin. Lyrical precision elevates craft over substance; thematic resonance never fully transcends poetic scaffolding.</comment>
