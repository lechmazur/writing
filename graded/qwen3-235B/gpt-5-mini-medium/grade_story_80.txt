<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits consistent traits (cluelessness shaping unorthodox methods) but lacks depth beyond poetic descriptions. Motivation exists but feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded in the text.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has cyclical structure (beginning/ending at roller coaster) but lacks traditional arcs or tension. Abstract progression through poetic imagery challenges conventional causality within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting's atmosphere of decay and mystery permeates the narrative through sensory details like "ink stains," "wind turning doorknobs," and "mildew-written instructions," creating cohesive, haunting ambiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric prose with fresh metaphors ("moths mapping light") and layered meaning elevates impact, though some emotional weight remains intangible despite strong thematic subtext about eroding wonder through discovery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original, dreamlike approach avoids genre tropes. Language is purposefully unconventional rather than purple prose, though some transitions between poetic passages could feel more organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of assigned elements creates a memorable experience, though the narrative sacrifices traditional stakes and character complexity for atmospheric abstraction.</comment>
