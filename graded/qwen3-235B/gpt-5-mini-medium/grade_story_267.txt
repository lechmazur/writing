<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (refusing binaries, shaping identity) are clear but remain abstract; internal conflict is implied through symbolism rather than concrete choices. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot but uses vignette structure effectively; progression is atmospheric rather than event-driven, which suits the concept but may frustrate expectations of narrative momentum. Pacing is uneven between dense metaphors and sparse action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black hole resort's surreal blend of decadence and decay is vividly rendered through sensory details (neon/eclipse olfactory mixing) and contrasts with subterranean alleys, though the setting sometimes leans on its own novelty rather than deep integration with the character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (anvil/guilt shaping, cats/blurred margins) are intricate and layered, with "savage bliss" and "improvised ethics" creating resonant tension. The ending encapsulates the theme beautifully. Occasionally risks overwriting but generally rewards careful reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original use of anvil/identity metaphors feels fresh. Avoids overt tropes while risking occasional abstraction. Some phrases ("petty salvations and quiet violences") verge on generic, but most imagery (dusk as garment, cats as teachers) feels inventive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Coherence emerges from thematic unity rather than plot. The brevity works as an aesthetic choice, and the layered metaphor of the anvil anchors the story. However, the poetic density may overwhelm some readers seeking narrative clarity.</comment>
