<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than psychologically developed; motivations are implied through esoteric rituals but lack emotional grounding or personal stakes beyond the abstract 'mission.'</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks conflict/resolution; circular meditative actions replace structured progression. Word limit exacerbates the absence of narrative momentum or definitive conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive and atmospheric, though the giant's book setting strains logic. Sensory details (lignin scent, 'electric peace') evoke mood that complements the abstract theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic polish and poetic metaphors ('moth-wing footage') impress, but emotional resonance is diluted by conceptual obscurity. The ending's 'electric peace' offers thematic cohesion but feels intellectually distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Original imagery balances on the edge of pretension. Avoids tropes but occasionally succumbs to ornate phrasing ('tactically reckless scholar of weather'), risking alienation of readers seeking emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding and metaphors are distinctive, but underdeveloped character and plot undermine its publishability. The story lingers as an idea sketch rather than a completed work.</comment>
