<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Lacks concrete character psychology; traits exist as poetic abstractions but produce no emotional resonance or internal conflict. "Innocent cynicism" remains a superficial descriptor rather than a lived paradox.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coherence maintained within brevity but sacrificed logical progression; decryption-to-discovery leap glossed over with poetic metaphors rather than narrative mechanics. Ending feels tacked-on, not earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Exceptional olfactory and tactile details create vivid atmosphere; however, the control tower remains underutilized as a spatial narrative device beyond aesthetic decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strikes original imagery chords ("metadata and myth") but overestimates poetic abstraction's ability to substitute for thematic depth or emotional engagement. The justice theme drifts toward abstract musing rather than urgent revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elevates "rain-smell decryption" beyond gimmick through recurring symbolism, but occasionally drowns in its own lyrical register. Avoids tropes by virtue of surrealism but risks incoherence through dense metaphoricity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic layering exists at the expense of narrative urgency; the story's individual components dazzle but don't fully cohere into a transcendent whole. Lingering question exists about justice's practical implications rather than its metaphysical framing.</comment>
