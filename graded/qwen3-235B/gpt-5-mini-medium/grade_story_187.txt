<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's actions align with stoic, archivist motivations but psychological depth feels oblique; the blend of brashness and tenderness lacks full emotional resonance despite poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Narrative momentum exists through symbolic gestures but lacks narrative inevitability; fragmented structure within the word limit sacrifices clear progression toward resolution or transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details like 'animal sleep' and iron smells immerse readers; setting functions as a character itself through rich, mythic atmosphere that crystallizes the story's thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ('nightmares traced in smoke') and archiving-as-ritual concept provoke thought; emotional engagement suffers from deliberate obfuscation of character interiority and narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose avoids clich√©s with phrases like 'hollow of that floorboard' but occasionally over-ornamented sentences ('wooden dummies curl like question marks') suggest self-indulgence rather than precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion despite density; some assigned elements feel more ornamental than essential to the story's conceptual scaffolding despite its linguistic accomplishment.</comment>
