<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's sincerity in preservation is clear but lacks personal stakes or flaws to ground his motivation; actions mostly static, limited depth in showing his resolve beyond vague gestures and internal theorizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pacing meanders without clear conflict progression; thematic coherence outweighs narrative urgency; resolution feels like a loop (hiding the note) rather than an arc, diminishing impact within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (dust, echoing boots) and sensory immersion; setting feels symbolic but underutilized—haunted passage’s "living" qualities rarely influence plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates mood and metaphor (e.g., "braided bitterness," "house breathed") but prioritizes style over emotional resonance; theme of craft preservation is poignant but thinly developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Refreshing fusion of preservationist struggle with ghostly metaphor, but repetitive phrasing ("constantly changing," "braided") and overwrought descriptors ("shared secrets") risk stylized affectation over authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery but lacks narrative urgency; assigned elements cohere aesthetically but rarely intersect to drive plot or deepen character beyond surface-level symbolism.</comment>
