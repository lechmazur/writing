<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character concept is poetic but lacks emotional depth; motivation is clear but internal conflict remains under-explored. Personality manifests through symbolic actions, but human nuance (like doubt or physical struggle) feels absent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc through environmental transformation, but lacks traditional narrative momentum. Key incident with skeptic provides tension, yet progression feels diffuse despite strong thematic consistency within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</price><comment>Atmosphere excels through synesthetic imagery (metal "leaning to listen") and temporal paradox of decay/hope. Sensory details overwhelm slightly, leaning too heavily on personification to carry mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "soft ledger of apology" and structural irony of machinery being swaddled create powerful layers. Emotional undercurrents sometimes stated rather than embodied, but ending's "tide of small reckonings" satisfies thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original use of tablecloth embroidery subverts expectations, avoiding clichés. Some phrasing ("arc of empathy," "circuit closing") borders on self-consciously clever, but overall resists formulaic emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into striking metaphysical metaphor about inherited trauma. Brief length serves poetic abstraction but risks vagueness—lingers conceptually but lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
