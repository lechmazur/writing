<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits are vividly sketched but insufficiently grounded in actionable, emotionally resonant depth; the shepherd’s "chaos as teacher" motivation lacks evolved internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on atmospheric beats rather than causality; thematic progression exists, but the narrative arc feels more like a vignette than a complete journey within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly textured Sumerian palace setting immerses readers through synesthetic details (e.g., whispering reliefs, trembling torchlight) that deepen mystery and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and extended metaphors (ledger of repressed cruelties, hairpin as wager) elevate thematic discourse; ending’s symbolic "reckoning" crystallizes the protagonist’s paradoxical idealism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting justice-as-memory over vengeance, but occasional overreliance on abstract, recursive phrasing (e.g., "chaotic humility") occasionally dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a mosaic of ideas and style, but its mosaic-like structure prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum; feels conceptually ambitious yet psychologically underdeveloped for maximal impact.</comment>
