<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "assertively meek" trait is established but inconsistently embodied; motivations for escaping the tech labyrinth are clear but lack psychological nuance beyond surface-level rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Firework-timed escape creates tension, but the method's success relies on vague technobabble; plot coherence falters in explaining how golden threads interface with algorithms. Pacing prioritizes atmospheric tension over logical clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Neon palms and QR ripples create a cyberpunk-adjacent tone, but the mirage oasis feels conceptually disjointed from the village-festival setting; sensory details dazzle but lack tactile consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor of cloth-as-code is striking, and subtext about folk technology vs. surveillance capitalism resonates; however, the ending's emotional impact is diluted by clinical prose and underdeveloped desperation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fresh concept of "xenialize" elevates originality, but purple prose ("firewall breathing," "mirage oasis") and abstracted emotions ("desperate optimism") lean into AI-generated affectlessness; tone leans on overwrought descriptors rather than earned poignancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are technically woven together but feel artificially assembled; the story's ambition exceeds its execution, offering intellectual stimulation over emotional resonance, with some narrative shortcuts undermining its high-concept premise.</comment>
