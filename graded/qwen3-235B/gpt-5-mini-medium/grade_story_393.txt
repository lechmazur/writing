<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underexplored; driven by desperation but lacks emotional nuance beyond the plot's demands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression through coincidences is inventive but occasionally disjointed; cause-and-effect logic is sometimes strained within the tight structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but uneven; suburban-to-mythic shift lacks grounding, weakening sensory immersion. Butterfly imagery and oil-smell details stand out.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (kinship as gears) and subtext about care over gold are striking; some themes telegraphed rather than shown. Ending resonates but feels slightly manufactured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in blending alchemy with mundane settings; avoids trope-presentation. Some metaphors verge on forced (e.g., "iron and bone sentries"), but mostly fresh and unexpected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion despite ambitious element-load; suburban-alchemy-to-kinship arc feels intentional. Watchtowers/glyph elements occasionally strain believability.</comment>
