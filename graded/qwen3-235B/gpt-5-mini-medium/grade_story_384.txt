<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (exposing institutional deceit) is clear but underdeveloped. His use of the eraser as both tool and talisman shows thematic depth, but his profession as a cook remains symbolic rather than psychologically integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression prioritizes poetic logic over clear causality. The central action (decoding notches) lacks concrete mechanics, but the structural symmetry of beginning/ending with "layers of dust" creates a closed loop that compensates for compressed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually dense atmosphere merges metaphor and reality (dust as both physical substance and archival obfuscation). The facility's temporal palimpsest ("centuries of dust over decades of instruments") creates uncanny tension between scientific permanence and historical fragility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor density achieves lyrical resonance (eraser as liturgical tool, notches as "tremor grammar"). The ending delivers conceptual payoff rather than emotional resolution, favoring intellectual over visceral impact. Subtext about erasure as historical reconstruction feels profound but under-embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality resides in subverting expert epistemologies through a domestic outsider. Some phrases risk preciousness ("paper ghosts," "frenzied tranquility"), but the central conceit of geological time as narrative weapon avoids clich√©. Thematic ambition outweighs occasional stylistic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story transcends gimmick through atmospheric cohesion. The core metaphor (scientific erasure vs. domestic reconstruction) lingers, but narrow focus on institutional critique limits broader philosophical exploration that might elevate it to masterwork status.</comment>
