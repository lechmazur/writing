<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional nuance; motivations are implied through actions but rarely dramatized. Humility shapes methodological approach but feels more mythologized than humanized. Voice remains atmospheric rather than distinctly individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot prioritizes texture over progression; the pilgrimage-as-ritual creates circularity but lacks tension or evolution. The middle section drifts without clear stakes. Pacing suits meditative tone but struggles to satisfy narrative expectations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is transcendent: sunken lab’s moss, algae-slick metal, and bottled light create a tactile, haunted dimension. Sensory details (root-tangled stories, solvent ghosts) fuse memory and environment seamlessly. Settings function as active extensions of character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is densely lyrical, using metaphor (“tiny oracles,” “moral geographies”) and layered subtext about inherited care. Emotional impact lies in cumulative imagery, not climactic beats. Ending lands thematically but sacrifices visceral stakes for abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality thrives in surreal logic—mapping as devotion, sleepwalking as methodology, humility as compass. Avoids clichés through granular specificity (e.g., “repairs glass” as love’s cartography). Only minor drifts into ornate abstraction threaten immersion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High thematic cohesion—every element reinforces the idea of quiet inheritance. Limited by vignette-like structure for standalone impact, but the interplay of mapping and memory leaves an intellectual imprint. Feels intentional, not constrained.</comment>
