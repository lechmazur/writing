<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation to protect the bird is clear but occasionally overshadowed by excessive focus on metaphorical abstractions; some traits (e.g., "earnest flippancy") feel imposed rather than organically demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through distinct vignettes but lacks a strong emotional arc; the birdâ€™s recovery and chemical accident create tension, but the tight word limit leaves little room for sustained dramatic development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting blends espionage and domesticity effectively, with vivid sensory details (solder/motor oil smells, mirrored booths), though the secret workshop occasionally strains credibility as a space for both espionage and bird rehabilitation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("liquify fear," "listening for tumblers") deepen the theme of quiet heroism; ending resonates emotionally, though some abstractions risk vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original conceptual contrasts (aristocratic manners vs. espionage tools) shine, but uneven phrasing ("the walls themselves learned mercy") and overused semicolons border on self-conscious stylization rather than organic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified metaphor about understated competence; tonal consistency and layered symbolism suggest strong authorial control, though some assigned elements feel underexploited.</comment>
