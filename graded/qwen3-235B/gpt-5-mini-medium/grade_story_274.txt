<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Abstract motivation and non-human perspective limit emotional weight; internal conflict feels more metaphorical than character-driven, with actions often arbitrary to the plant's nature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Meandering structure substitutes coherence; the spontaneous decision lacks causal momentum, while symbolic resolutions remain intellectually stimulating but narratively diffuse within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, synesthetic sensory details (lavender, rusted metal) and decaying drive-in imagery create immersive melancholy; atmosphere becomes character in absence of traditional development.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unconventional premise and poetic abstraction feel fresh but occasionally risk collapsing into self-indulgent prose; avoids tropes but skirts the edge of pretension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Linguistic density and atmospheric worldbuilding suggest authorial vision, though the balance between lyrical excess and narrative clarity remains debatable for strict publishability standards.</comment>
