<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than fully realized; motivation exists but lacks psychological depth, with actions feeling abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks conventional progression; poetic momentum substitutes for narrative development, risking coherence and satisfying resolution within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in the library’s ghostly atmosphere, though the setting’s scientific poetry aspect feels conceptually underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly evocative prose with layered metaphor; tension between silence and sound creates subtextual richness, though emotional payoff remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors, but occasionally veers into mannered lyricism; some phrases ("small-town sheriff," "tarnished silver chain") feel assigned rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story’s cohesion resides in tone and imagery rather than narrative; ambitious but struggles to balance experimental style with thematic clarity in the constrained format.</comment>
