<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to decode interstellar secrets through stories is intriguing but lacks emotional depth; the renegade's methods are consistent but insufficiently grounded in tangible emotions or vulnerabilities.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively but remains episodic; the astronomer's arrival feels underdeveloped, and the resolution of decoding the postcard lacks narrative urgency or stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with ozone, seaweed, and ink creating a tactile library setting; the zeppelin's movement and "small sad music" enhance the melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., "constellations resolving into sentences") elevates the prose; the story's thematic interest in hidden narratives is compelling but occasionally undercut by overly abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphors like "braidings of memory and math," but phrases like "sharp gentleness" risk becoming self-consciously poetic without fully avoiding AI-generated abstraction patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambient beauty and high-concept ideas coexist with vague emotional beats; the story's cohesion and lingering questions about untold stories suggest depth but lack the structural rigor of a publishable masterpiece.</comment>
