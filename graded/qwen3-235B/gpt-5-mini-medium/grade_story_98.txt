<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's faintheartedness is established but never fully explored beyond symbolic gestures; development relies more on metaphor than emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on the sentinel’s interaction with the tapestry, but the arc feels more like fragmented introspection than a traditional structure; pacing is deliberate yet occasionally meandering.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory contrasts between the chamber’s ritualistic atmosphere and mundane dog-walking soundscape create tension; the secret society setting is vivid but occasionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subtle use of metaphor (ruler as delusion of control, tapestry as palimpsest) elevates the narrative; the ending’s shift from paradox to vantage is emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Imagery feels fresh (e.g., “air stitched with ceremony”), but the sentinel’s interiority occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction rather than earned tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into theme and tone, though the societal rituals and tapestry’s mechanics could be more fully realized; the ending feels earned but underexplored.</comment>
