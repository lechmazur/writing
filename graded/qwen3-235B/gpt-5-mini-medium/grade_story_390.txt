<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation (spinning prophecy into possibility) is vivid but remains abstract; actions align with traits but lack emotional depth; reactions to objects like the botanical press reveal some nuance but stop short of profound insight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Amalgamating rumor/ritual drives the plot; butterfly-wing method is internally consistent but underexplored; the "before first question" timeframe creates urgency yet disrupts traditional arc; pacing is tight but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting's sensory details (jasmine, incense, lacquer) create immersive, ornate atmosphere; tone contrasts humor and gravity effectively; integration of objects (botanical press, silk) with setting is meticulous but occasionally stylized to a fault.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (butterfly wings as prophecy, "palace inhales") elevate craft; subtext about literalizing metaphors anchors thematic cohesion; writing style is lyrical yet purposeful, though some lines border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through surreal specifics (e.g., pigeon inspecting combs); metaphors are inventive but occasionally obscure; emotional resonance emerges through subtext rather than exposition; tone shifts feel intentional and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich, if slightly hermetic, whole; style enhances rather than distracts; brevity feels purposeful, leaving evocative ambiguity rather than vagueness; lingering questions suggest depth without overexplaining.</comment>
