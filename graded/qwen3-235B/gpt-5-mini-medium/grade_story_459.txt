<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "elegantly clumsy" trait and spectral sensitivity are vividly established, but motivations remain abstractly philosophical rather than viscerally felt. Some actions (e.g., crown rituals) hint at depth, but the core existential conflict feels observed rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story lacks traditional plot progression, relying on meditative repetition rather than cause-effect dynamics. The thematic arc about release is clear but the compressed form creates uneven momentum between introspection and external action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric worldbuilding through tactile industrial decay (damp gypsum, humming dehumidifier) and liminal spaces. The sand castle lab's fragility mirrors the protagonist's spiritual preoccupations with impermanence, creating visceral environmental storytelling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking poetic language elevates the piece - "silence dissection," "granola bar surgeries," "confessions in sand" showcase layered metaphor. Subtext about trauma-as-maintenance work resonates, though some abstractions ("palms of time") risk preciosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Resists genre tropes by framing paranormal interaction through blue-collar labor and scientific methodology. Avoids melodrama with controlled lyricism - the flower crown's salt-stained fragility and tactile ghost-hunting (measuring silence) subvert conventional haunting narratives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion through sand metaphors and silence motifs creates organic unity. The brief form feels purposeful as fragmented vignettes echoing the protagonist's fractured connection to life/death. Leaves questions about the technician's own unspoken burdens.</comment>
