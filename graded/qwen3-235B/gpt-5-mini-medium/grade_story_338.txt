<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character exists as a thematic anchor but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear yet static, reducing engagement beyond their symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose compensates for absent plot; momentum stalls as wandering and disconnected vignettes replace structured progression or resolution.</comment>
