<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Symbolic depth outweighs concrete character motivations; traits like "grudgingly sweet" feel more atmospheric than psychologically grounded. Actions align with abstract themes but lack visceral internal consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot exists as cyclical introspection rather than linear progression; the knocker's strike serves as both climax and unresolved question. Structure prioritizes thematic resonance over causal clarity, bordering on narrative ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sturm-tossed sea, mirrored prison, and jagged reef create a hauntingly coherent metaphorical landscape. Sensory details (tar-scented hands, clicking seashells) anchor ethereal concepts in tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (random items as grammar of regret, silence made of light) elevates beyond surface narrative. Ending resonates as both philosophical meditation and visceral experience, though abstraction risks emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging lighthouse prison with mirrored futures. Avoids formulaic tropes through poetic precision; occasional phrases like "grudgingly sweet smile" flirt with overwrought elegance but mostly succeed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesion emerges through relentless thematic focus, though brevity sometimes flattens emotional arcs. Elements function as poetic machinery rather than narrative scaffolding, leaving lingering questions rather than closure.</comment>
