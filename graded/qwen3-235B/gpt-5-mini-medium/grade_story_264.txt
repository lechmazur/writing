<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are atmospheric but underexplored: the alchemist's "unruly" nature and the custodian's skepticism lack psychological depth or transformative arc; motivations are stated but insufficiently dramatized through interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent moment without conventional plot structure; the custodian's shift from skepticism to openness is implied but lacks concrete behavioral or emotional progression; episodic pacing suits the atmospheric focus but undermines narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting merges poetic abstraction with tangible details (projector's bulb-as-heartbeat, ballpark juxtaposition) to evoke liminality; atmosphere dominates over functional worldbuilding, but the dreamlike consistency reinforces the thematic tension between wonder and routine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exquisite use of metaphor and subtext elevates the story; the projector as "mechanical lullaby" and "city map of brief, brave lives" exemplify lyrical precision that amplifies the theme of fragile wonder without veering into sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; metaphors are specific and purposeful (e.g., "laughter replacing doubt's mortar"), though the "unruly alchemist" archetype slightly edges toward romanticized trope territory; emotional nuance prioritizes implication over exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly weighted; some (cracked lens, projector) are organically thematic, while others (timeframe) feel structurally pivotal yet narratively peripheral; the ending suggests transcendence without fully earning its emotional resonance.</comment>
