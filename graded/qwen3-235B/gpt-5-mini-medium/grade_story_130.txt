<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between self-acceptance and apprenticeship is clear, but motivations (especially regarding the apprentice's knot and traveler's advice) lack layered development. The shift from mocking to softened affection feels abrupt rather than earned through consistent action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot arc from folded silence to truth-telling is coherent and condensed effectively within the limit. Reverse-engineering static into maps logically shapes the transformation, though the ship's pollen satellites as symbolic gesture feels underdeveloped in the final act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Interstellar orchard setting is vividly rendered through sensory paradox (citrus/gravity wells) and objects (solar-filament nests). Atmosphere of migratory stasis perfectly mirrors the character's liminality, though the "garden cabin on Io" feels geographically vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (nest as confession, static as maps) and recursive imagery (paper cranes/nests/coiled knots) create profound thematic cohesion. The ending's "key turning" laugh transcends sentimental clich√© through its orbit metaphor. Subtext about truth requiring deconstruction resonates intellectually and emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose avoids overt tropes with original comparisons ("voice like salt and honey," "privately open as a moon's underside"), though minor phrases ("promises of changing winds") lean on familiar poetics. Emotional beats are implied through ritual (reweaving nests) rather than stated, but some atmospheric details verge on indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Each element (interstellar orchard's hybridized ecology, silence-as-method, nested confessions) serves character growth and thematic aims. The story's poetic density rewards multiple readings, leaving resonant questions about identity as both constructed and organic. Length feels exact, not abbreviated.</comment>
