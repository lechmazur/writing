<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's secret and creative block shape his actions, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Core motivation to offer peace is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict exploration. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Memory-triggering method drives the plot, but the resolution with Mara feels abrupt. Pacing is tense yet cohesive within word limits; cause-effect between tactile memory and emotional shift is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk elements (oil, mechanical orchids) evoke mood but lack specificity. Atmosphere supports melancholy tone but feels generic. Sensory details are vivid yet insufficient to make setting integral to thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Comment:</question><question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade>  
<comment>Linguistic precision and tactile metaphors elevate impact; subtext about reconciling guilt through memory is present. No overt "purple prose," but some descriptors (e.g., "coral reef in high tide") border on abstract ornamentation. Emotional resonance is subtle but occasionally undercut by overly lyrical phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but relies on familiar redemption arcs. Elements like the gauntlet serve thematic purpose, but compression feels limiting rather than intentional. The final truce evokes lingering complexity but lacks visceral immediacy.</comment>
