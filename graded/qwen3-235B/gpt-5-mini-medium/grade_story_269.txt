<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched through metaphor and specific actions (stitching memories, garments as vessels) but lacks psychological depth; motivations are poetic yet abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Meanders through poetic imagery rather than narrative momentum; coherence exists but structure feels more like a mosaic of moments than a conventional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (coal, lightning, brass) immersive but occasionally overwhelm narrative function; steampunk elements atmospheric rather than integrally shaping the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "stitches as secret seams") and symbolic gestures (mirror confessions) create haunting resonance; themes of transcendence linger, though emotional engagement fluctuates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagining identity as patchwork garments and storms as ritual; some phrases ("hopeful desperation") verge on overpolishing but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a cohesive mythos, though the brevity leaves some seams visible; the transcendence theme feels deliberate but occasionally strained by complexity.</comment>
