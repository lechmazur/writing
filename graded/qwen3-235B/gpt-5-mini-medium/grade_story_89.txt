<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's zeal is central but remains abstract; motivation for silent revolution feels conceptually poetic rather than emotionally grounded; spiritual-material duality isn't fully dramatized into behavioral specifics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot builds through ritualistic actions and subtle consequences, but progression relies on prose elegance over narrative causality; shifts from individual act to societal impact lack concrete bridges.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered through sensory alchemy—variable star shadows, tactile descriptions of rust and cloth—that make the abstract metaphysics tangible and uncanny.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose itself becomes revolutionary: metaphors (statues dissolving as ink in rain), recursive structure, and the tension between "confusing certainty" create profound thematic resonance and linger beyond the final line.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI markers but occasionally falters into recursive abstractions ("materially spiritual," "whispered legends") that feel more decorative than functional to the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion—every symbol ties to memory-as-corrosive; time capsules as revolutionary architecture feels conceptually bold yet narratively ephemeral.</comment>
