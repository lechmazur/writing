<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is poetic but inconsistent; their gardening metaphor doesn't fully integrate with emotional decoding actions. Voice remains diffuse despite lyrical introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fragmentary vignettes lack causal progression and resolution. The method (decoding emotions) dominates over structured plot, making momentum feel stagnant despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical atmosphere (bird calls, scent of rain) immerses through precise sensory details. The universal translation center's abstraction paradoxically enhances the story's introspective tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich subtext about language's limits and memory's physicality elevates the narrative. Metaphors like "punctuation of feeling" and showing-over-telling create lasting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors are consistently startlingly fresh ("pocketwatch of moments"). Escapes purple prose through rhythmic repetition. No clich√©s or mechanical phrasing despite density of imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Elements like the purse and silent retreat feel woven into thematic tapestry, but the universal translation center's purpose remains abstract rather than integral to structural cohesion.</grade>
