<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Main character lacks emotional depth; traits and motivations are implied rather than embodied through concrete, layered behavior or subtext. Nuance is overshadowed by abstract metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on internal resolution rather than narrative progression; structure feels compressed and elliptical but lacks tension or transformative arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich, evocative details (smells, light, water) immerse the reader, but the setting occasionally verges on affectation rather than functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (leaves, frost as blueprints) are vivid, but emotional impact is diffused by overly abstract prose; ending lingers but feels under-resolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality emerges in unconventional metaphors and the fusion of chemistry, art, and regret; occasionally undermined by lyrical excesses that border on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story weaves elements into a cohesive meditation on time and apology, though brevity prevents full thematic realization; poetic but unevenly impactful.</comment>
