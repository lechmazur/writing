<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; the character exists as an enigmatic archetype rather than a fully realized persona. Motivations remain abstractly philosophical rather than emotionally grounded. The "robustly delicate" trait is superficially applied without exploring paradoxical implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure follows a procedural loop rather than narrative arc - this works within the constraints but sacrifices traditional coherence. The library card opening creates false expectations of causality that never fully resolve into satisfying structural symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ethereal vapor-and-brass city blends effectively with the scapegoat's liminal existence. Some imagery (metal washer as "tiny moon") creates striking sensory resonance, though atmospheric continuity falters during abstract philosophical digressions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrically recursive language creates hypnotic rhythm. The washer-as-talisman and "guilt settling into new skins" metaphors achieve poetic resonance. However, excessive abstraction risks disconnecting emotional engagement from the conceptual elegance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surrealism, though some phrases ("echo of that signature") border on familiar melancholia. The decoding-as-atonement mechanic shows ingenuity, but occasional ornate descriptions weaken impact ("threading the washer on invisible lines as if tuning the sky").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>6.7</grade>  
<comment>Maintains cohesion through recurring symbolic motifs without achieving transcendent unity. The brevity works conceptually but limits character investment. Lingers through atmosphere rather than narrative gravity.</comment>
