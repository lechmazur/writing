<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's naive cleverness informs his nuanced method, and motivation remains consistent. However, emotional depth feels slightly surface-level despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight cause-effect structure with lyrical pacing. The machine's defeat flows logically from setup, though the transition from listening to resolution lacks visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere intertwines with plot through sensory motifs (quince/smoke) and resonant spatial logic (maze/orchard). The setting becomes an active participant in the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate thematically (machines as collective memory, edges as fragmented truth). The ending resonates emotionally but could complicate the "sabotage as mercy" duality further.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases verge on ornate abstraction ("pruning-smoke"), but the central conceit of a memory-fixation machine feels conceptually inventive. Emotional beats occasionally rely on adjectival scaffolding rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around memory's duality. The knight's quiet victory avoids pat answers, leaving intriguing questions about the ethics of forgetting. Concise yet resonant within constraints.</comment>
