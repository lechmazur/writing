<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength lies in the protagonist's consistent defiance as motivation, but lacks emotional evolution beyond abstract resilienceâ€”depth exists but feels static despite poetic attempts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on introspection over action; the maze's structure mirrors thematic patterns but sacrifices narrative momentum. Resolutions feel more like declarations than earned progressions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly tactile: mirrors as prejudice, the orchard's rot/cider juxtaposing decay and memory. Atmosphere amplifies theme without feeling redundant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lush metaphors elevate the story (e.g., rope as "old compass"), but some poetic abstraction undercuts emotional immediacy. Ending thematically resonant but emotionally reserved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unconventional tone and symbolic richness suggest human creativity, though occasional metaphors (e.g., "calculated wilderness") risk contrivance. Balances originality with potential overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel loosely bound narratively. The brevity works conceptually but leaves some tensions underdeveloped. Lingering impact stems from imagery, not plot.</comment>
