<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist’s internal conflict and backstory remain surface-level despite symbolic actions with the ticket punch. The dialogue-driven resolution with the woman feels slightly rushed but effectively ties consent to character voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Circular structure prioritizes thematic resonance over plot momentum; the central action of exchanging the brass punch lacks narrative escalation. Coherence is maintained through tone but suffers from abrupt pacing shifts and underdeveloped cause-effect chains.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone, rust, tomato stems) create an immersive atmosphere. The abandoned spaceport’s decay mirrors emotional and societal neglect, though setting feels more symbolic than functionally integral to the plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (consent-as-ritual, decay-as-prejudice) elevate the subtext. The ending’s ceremonial exchange avoids pat resolution but occasionally sacrifices emotional immediacy for lyrical abstraction. Subtext dominates over explicit action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes through unconventional pairings (professional cuddler/heirloom tomatoes). Some overwritten lines (“cathedral of departures”) edge toward purple prose, but the central metaphor of puncturing time/empathy feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere more thematically than structurally; the 7A-J requirements feel both purposeful and occasionally contrived (7G, 7F). Tight prose elevates the concept, though the brevity leaves some threads (e.g., father’s hucksterism) underexplored.</comment>
