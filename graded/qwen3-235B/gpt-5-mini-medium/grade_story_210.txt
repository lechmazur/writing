<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits (meticulous archivist/collector of nonsense) and a central motivation to fuse old/new knowledge, but lacks emotional complexity. Actions align with assigned elements but feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Circular structure (unfinished-to-finished crossword) provides minimal arc. Pacing is dreamlike but lacks strong forward motion. Plot coherence exists through mood more than events, weakening within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hauntingly specific details (tide charts + LED meters, ship timber whispers) create immersive sensory dissonance. Timeframe repetitions create narrative unease rather than confusion. Atmosphere elevates all other elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("Morse of salt and wood," "confession" of ship timbers) enhance thematic layering. Ending lacks overt resolution but achieves poetic closure. Tension between antiquity/modernity resonates through style rather than plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unique conceits avoid clich√© (ship timbers humming lullabies, crosswords as maps). Some overwritten phrases ("slow Morse of salt," "fog pressed like a question") border on self-caricature, but originality outweighs excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>All elements present but unevenly integrated - "waiting room once good news arrives" especially disrupts flow. Style suits lyrical intent but sacrifices immediacy. Lingering impact comes from haunting imagery rather than narrative propulsion.</comment>
