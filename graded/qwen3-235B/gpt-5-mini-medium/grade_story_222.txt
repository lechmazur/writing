<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority; motivation hinges on abstract "stewardship" with minimal emotional grounding. Traits like "secretive" and "philosophically shallow" are stated but underdramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>No clear plot arc—reads as static vignette. The action of taming ecology lacks stakes or transformation. Pacing lingers decoratively without narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (bio-lights, sealed vents) but inconsistent—extraterrestrial elements feel generic. Sensory details (salt/pollen) work but lack integration with deeper world-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery ("bio-lights shifting hue," "root maps") elevates the prose. Themes of compassion vs. control have subtext, but emotional resonance is muted by abstraction. Ending achieves quiet resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some elegant metaphors ("treaties like weather") but occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing ("blueprints for mercy"). Avoids overt clichés but risks ornamental prose over narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack thematic propulsion. The tight word limit feels restrictive, leaving the story impressionistic rather than resonant. Lingering questions about purpose are underdeveloped.</comment>
