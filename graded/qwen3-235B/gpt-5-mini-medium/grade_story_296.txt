<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s introspective rituals convey depth, but motivation remains introspection-heavy with minimal external grounding; hatefully adored chopsticks lack psychological nuance despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot’s ritualistic pacing achieves mood but lacks narrative stakes; the cyclical structure around the fluorescents dying creates cohesion but minimal progression beyond iterative symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Submarine facility’s sensory details (hull sighs, fluorescent buzz, kelp) immerse effectively; atmosphere leans into claustrophobic introspection, though connections between setting and emotional subtext could deepen.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (chocksticks as “keys,” currents as scripture) elevate; poetic language weaves spiritual subtext into mundane decay. Ending achieves thematic resonance but risks abstraction obscuring emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes; metaphors (“hatefully adored,” “ruin become grammar”) are original. Some phrases flirt with overwrought lyricism, but subtext in mapping loneliness as algae growth feels inventive and restrained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize in tone but lack narrative propulsion. The story leans on lyrical cohesion over traditional plot, which suits its thematic focus but undermines urgency or emotional payoff.</comment>
