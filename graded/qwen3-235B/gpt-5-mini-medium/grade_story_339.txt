<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's conflicted nature is evident but remains abstract; motivation tied to guilt is consistent though underexplored, with insufficient depth to sustain emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven within constraints; the connection between organizing props and emotional resolution feels strained, with cause-and-effect relationships implied but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (prismatic lake, construction sounds) create atmosphere but occasionally overwhelm the narrative; the setting leans toward aesthetic ornamentation rather than functional integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements are stylistically cohesive but thematically fragmented; the storyâ€™s brevity accentuates disjointedness between abstract symbolism and narrative progression.</comment>
