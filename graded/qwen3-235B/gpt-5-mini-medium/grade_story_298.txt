<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits and motivation are present but underdeveloped; chameleon nature only superficially explored through emotional shifts rather than core personality conflicts. Impulsive rationality remains abstract rather than manifesting in concrete decisions that reveal contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; action revolves around thematically linked vignettes that create atmosphere but insufficient narrative progression. Cause/effect relationships between discovery of objects and emotional revelations feel implied rather than dramatized with clear stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create haunting atmosphere through motifs of decay and memory, but setting remains stylized abstraction rather than culturally grounded reality. Ancient Chinese palace elements feel symbolic rather than historically textured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story's emotional weight carried by poetic metaphors and emotional mathematics conceit, which elevates it beyond mere imagery. Theatrical metaphors for healing historical trauma create lingering resonance despite diffuse structure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Nuanced metaphors (emotional mathematics, translating grief through performance) avoid clich√©s, but some phrases border on overwrought ("threads the courtyard like a patient question"). Emotion resides in abstractions rather than embodied character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive thematic mosaic rather than narrative engine; excessive focus on atmospheric prose comes at expense of character psychology and concrete conflict resolution within tight word limit.</comment>
