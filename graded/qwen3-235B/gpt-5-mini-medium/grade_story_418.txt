<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Core motivation is clear but emotional complexity lacks; character’s "headstrong" trait drives plot more than inner conflict. Actions align with traits but psychological depth remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc exists, but pacing falters in middle due to compressed word limit. Connections between opening/closing images feel thematic rather than tightly causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glittering decay of the orchard viscerally contrasts fragility/rebellious vibrance. Sensory details (glitter as "constellation," metallic fruit, glittering dust) richly unify tone and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor (glitter as gendered transformation, stained glass as fractured memory) elevates the narrative. Ending’s quiet revolution through shared subversion of grayness resonates emotionally and thematically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose occasionally verges on ornate abstraction ("feminize angles of her face") but retains stylistic individuality. Emotional nuance emerges through symbolic actions over interiority, avoiding overt telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements function as deliberate thematic tools rather than checklist. Some surface-level motif repetition (e.g., "tenuously certain") slightly weakens cohesion, but overall execution feels intentional.</comment>
