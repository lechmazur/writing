<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits and actions are symbolically cohesive, but psychological depth is secondary to metaphor, leaving motivations feeling conceptual rather than humanly visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plosive vignettes replace structured pacing; the duel finale feels underdeveloped despite poetic tension. Arc is implied rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (steam, gears, lullabies) are lushly immersive, with log flume's "splinters of history" perfectly evoking memory's role in diplomacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors ("soups folded treaties") are inventive, though reliance on abstract emotional states (forgiveness, truce) risks vagueness. The duel resolution lingers subliminally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally veers into ornate density, but the fusion of culinary alchemy and dimensional politics avoids generic speculative tropes. Emotional nuance is implied through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere and thematic cohesion elevate structural looseness. The interplay of ingredients-as-diplomacy offers contemplative resonance, though narrative scope feels constrained by ambition.</comment>
