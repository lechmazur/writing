<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's bluffing nature and energetic lethargy are vividly depicted through physicality and internal conflict, but the sudden shift from swindler to collaborator lacks sufficient psychological grounding despite strong voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Non-linear structure driven by symbolic encounters works within constraints, but the frozen computer restarting as plot trigger feels over-determined, weakening organic cause-and-effect despite strong atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Toppled skyscraper/orchard fusion creates haunting ecological uncanny through precise sensory dissonance (e.g., apple blossoms/smoke), making decayed future tactile and conceptually resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Allegorical weight of erased property history emerges organically from tactile symbols (price tags, ledgers); ending's moral ambiguity and use of "invisible allies" as metaphor for systemic forces elevate thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through ecological surrealism, but occasional overwritten lines ("energetically lethargic motor") and underdeveloped ghost-as-metaphor motif prevent perfect clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements synergize into mythic realism, with brevity enhancing poetic compression; the ledger-reveal climax's thematic weight justifies word economy despite slight underdevelopment in character psychology.</comment>
