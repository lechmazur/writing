<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but psychological complexity is thin; escapes via an abstract act rather than concrete decisions, diluting emotional resonance despite evocative phrasing of servitude.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from abrupt disappearance mechanics; the paradox of "theoretically spontaneous" lacks narrative payoff, leaving tension between poetic abstraction and grounded cause-effect underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting through fragmented celestial metaphors and tactile details (comet dust, sludge), though the base’s intrigue remains atmospheric rather than structurally functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("soap suds as galaxies") and subtext about artistic self-erasure create lingering impact, though dialogue absence limits emotional multiplicity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in disappearance but skirts AI-like abstraction with phrases like "filaments of complicity"; metaphors are fresh but occasionally over-polished, risking preciousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole about creative autonomy, though some components (intrigue, timeframe) feel decorative rather than integral to the core metaphor.</comment>
