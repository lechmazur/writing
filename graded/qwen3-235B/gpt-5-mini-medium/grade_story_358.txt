<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is vivid but motivation remains abstract, blending sanctified dread with filial care without fully reconciling their tension. Rituals reveal dedication but lack grounding in human-like reasoning, making his frontier obsession feel more symbolic than emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows from meditative routine to climactic revelation, but the tight structure relies on lyrical abstraction over narrative momentum. The connection between opening atmosphere and closing stewardship is poetic yet feels abrupt; the frontier's consequences lack concrete resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse is rendered with rich sensory details (wool/lamp oil, frost sigils), and the juxtaposition of playground time against sanctified dread creates haunting contrast. Atmosphere excels, though the distant base’s children occasionally feel like thematic props rather than organic elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors intertwine science and ritual with precision (e.g., “liturgy of praxis,” “panes became windows into the possible”). The ending’s stewardship revelation lingers effectively, though dense prose risks overshadowing emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending pharaoh’s coffin and polar setting, but prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction (“consecrated tundra”). Avoids clichés but sacrifices some immediacy; children’s role feels intuitive rather than deeply earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole, though playground time’s purpose feels secondary. The frontier theme carries weight, but the narrative’s brevity leaves the mage’s internal conflict slightly underexplored. Lingering questions about the frontier’s cost elevate its intrigue.</comment>
