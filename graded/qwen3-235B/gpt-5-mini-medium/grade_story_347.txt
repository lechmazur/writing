<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Poetic abstraction undermines character clarity; traits like "singularly multiple" lack grounding in tangible behavior or relatable internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Abstract motifs substitute for narrative momentum; the shoelace incident lacks emotional stakes or clear resolution within the compressed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visceral sensory language (oil, violin strings, chlorophyll) creates immersive atmosphere but struggles to anchor the story's metaphysical abstractions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</comment>Richly original imagery occasionally veers into preciosity; avoids genre tropes but sometimes replaces clich√©s with impenetrable symbolism, muddying thematic clarity.
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh human resonance; the synthesis of philosophical concepts and mechanical-biological fusion is ambitious but unevenly executed within the constraints.</comment>
