<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Penance and scars imply deep motivation but lack tangible backstory; contradictions between "disgruntled" and sudden resolve feel poetic rather than psychologically convincing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escalation from observation to action is thematically cohesive, but the 500-word arc feels compressed; shifts between contemplation and movement lack visceral cause-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (tin jingling, rain-blurred corridors), but some metaphors ("wind as stitch") verge on overabstraction; tone sustains the eerie urban mystery effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery-rich prose creates haunting subtext about guilt and redemption; ending ties scars to purpose elegantly, though emotional impact leans on lyrical abstraction rather than dramatic payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through stylized prose and ambiguous setting, though "wishing well" remains under-recontextualized; metaphors like scars-as-direction feel earned, but some adverbial phrasing ("inherited mystery") risks pretension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Elements interlock thematically (scars/relaxation, shadows/ghosts) but narrative momentum wavers; style elevates material while occasionally obscuring emotional immediacy.</grade>
