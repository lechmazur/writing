<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but underexplored; inner conflict hinted at through abstract metaphors rather than concrete emotional layers. The sculptor's actions align with stated motives but lack visceral, individualized reactions that fully ground their transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure relies on lyrical abstraction over cause-effect clarity. The inciting action (ring disassembling) emerges logically from the method but feels emotionally inert due to sparse narrative scaffolding. Tightening could enhance arc definition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through fossil-specific details (light corridors between vertebrae, petrified bark grooves) that blend scientific and mythic registers. Sensory immersion elevates the setting from backdrop to active participant in the character's metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong on metaphor (light as mappable boundary, failure as seed) and thematic cohesion (reconfiguration as rebirth). Prose occasionally tilts toward abstraction but earns lyrical risks through precise, resonant imagery. The ending's tactile "ridiculous truth" lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but leans on poetic abstraction to mask narrative thinness. The sculptor's "bored exhilaration" feels idiosyncratic, though some phrases ("sentimental paralysis") veer toward academese. Metaphors are fresh but occasionally diffuse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements like the fossilized setting and puzzle ring are organically intertwined with theme, though the "boundaries of light" concept remains visually potent but narratively peripheral. The brevity works but sacrifices deeper psychological stakes.</comment>
