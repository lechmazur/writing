<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's vendetta and creativity are implied through symbolic actions but lack intimate emotional depth or vulnerability; motivations tied to erased motherland are present but under-explored, weakening the emotional resonance of her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot pivots on the photograph trail's revelation of erased geography, but the compressed narrative struggles to balance expository weight with poetic brevity; thematic resolution is elegant, but transitional logic between key beats feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pervasive sugar-and-siege atmosphere creates eerie, dreamlike cohesion; sensory details (caramel, seaweed, brittle maps) immerse effectively, though the rebellion's temporal scope remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (sugar-as-resistance, maps-as-memory) elevates storytelling; elegant subtext about erasure and collective hope lingers, with the child's locket trade functioning as a gut-punch of narrative symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality thrives in merging culinary craft with cartography; avoids clich√©s by framing revolution as confectionary artistry. Some phrases ("scent of possibility") flirt with overused lyrical tropes, but overall stylistic clarity prevails.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically but unevenly execution-wise; rebellion timeframe and anonymous kindness feel secondary to the cartographic vendetta. The core metaphor of sugar-as-memory remains potent and resonant.</comment>
