<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are evocative but remain surface-level sketches; motivations are implied through metaphor rather than humanized psychology. The assigned attribute "passionately indifferent" is conceptually present but lacks internal conflict or transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure mimics the cyclical hush and after-images, but lacks causal momentum. Repetitive phrases like "in the hush" create static pacing, and the story's arc leans on abstract atmosphere rather than narrative progression or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sustained atmospheric detail (e.g., "ash," "coal dust," "persistent nightmares") creates immersion, but the secret society setting feels underdefined and disconnected from the miner's personal grief. Sensory elements are precise but unevenly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose elevates the story's emotional resonance—e.g., "technological shifts ripple through lives like shafts of light"—but some abstract phrasing ("memory-lilt") risks over-ornamentation. Subtext around memory-as-machinery is compelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Demonstrates individual style and rich metaphor, but borders on purple prose. Phrases like "theater of small inventions" feel fresh, while "persistent nightmares" and "collateral change" verge on academic abstraction rather than raw human specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Highly evocative but loosely unified. Assigned elements function more as thematic anchors than narrative drivers; cohesion emerges through tone rather than tight synthesis of parts. Ends with lingering questions rather than lingering impact.</comment>
