<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but remains abstract; actions align with traits, but lacks psychological complexity or significant transformation. Voice is poetic but distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure with resonant resolution, but lacks traditional stakes or dynamic conflict. Pacing is contemplative yet occasionally stagnant within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly constructed through synesthetic details and thematic setting, though the echo chamber occasionally feels symbolic rather than organically integrated into action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphor (e.g., "heartbeat of nothingness") create profound emotional resonance. Subtle subtext about healing through auditory archaeology elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors, but occasional over-reliance on abstract phrasing ("calibration and formal humility") risks alienating readers through intellectualized emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements work cohesively within a tightly wound thematic unity, though the storyâ€™s brevity leaves some character/plot potential unfulfilled despite deliberate design.</comment>
