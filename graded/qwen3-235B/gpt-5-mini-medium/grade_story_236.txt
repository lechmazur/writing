<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character's motivation and actions merge abstractly but lack psychological depth; his "meekness" influences his hidden role but feels more symbolic than human. The assigned traits shape behavior but fail to reveal a concrete identity beneath the poetic metaphors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into poetic loops; no discernible arc in constraint, just circular collection and ignition. The method of verifying stories drives little forward motion; the vague "unfinished bargain" and static scenes create stasis rather than progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater city's bioluminescent algae and rust-proof drafting table create immersive, melancholic atmosphere. Sensory details about iron-tinted air and humming draft tubes immerse readers. Setting and tone synergize with themes of submerged grief and fragmented light.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance of sorrow as fuel and dictionary marginalia as emotional ledger. Ending's open tension—"city would warm and forgive"—avoids pat closure. Subtext about bureaucratic denial of emotion lingers, though subtle action weakens character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality in sorrow-as-fuel concept and "openly hidden" duality, but stylistic excess ("taste of iron and salt," "slow arithmetic of ache") risks self-parody. Too many abstractions ("stitched seams of heartbreak") dilute emotional authenticity despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Cohesion survives through recurring symbols but feels more like tone exercise than story. Elements serve theme but lack narrative urgency; brief length highlights conceptual gaps rather than deliberate concision. Lingering questions about "lineage's debt" remain frustrating, not thought-provoking.</comment>
