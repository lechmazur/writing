<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically implied but lack psychological depth; the dreamer's ferocity and politeness create tension yet never fully resolve into a tangible personal history or inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves with lyrical inevitability but sacrifices structural clarity; the coin toss framing works as cyclical anchor, though compressed progression from debate to deployment feels schematic rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually sumptuous worldbuilding dominates, with workshops smelling of violets and sunlight mapped in bands; atmosphere functions as active third character shaping actions and tensions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (seed banks in marginalia, mariner's wheel as ecological compass) elevates thematic resonance; dialogue remains abstractly rhetorical rather than dramatically charged, weakening emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant prose avoids clich√© but occasionally indulges in baroque abstractions; "dams rebuilt with living roots" shows ecological innovation, though some sensory descriptions verge on ornamental excess without subversive edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements function interdependently - masks inform political tension, the workshop enables covert preservation - though compressed format necessitates sacrificing individual character specificity for collective symbolism.</comment>
