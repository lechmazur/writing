<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character is poetically symbolic but lacks emotional interiority; motivations are coherent but understated, conveyed through actions more than psychology, which may feel too abstract under extreme scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Meandering structure prioritizes theme over plot, with repetitive gestures substituting for progression; lacks a clear arc but maintains subtle momentum through cyclical actions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Gorgeous, immersive atmosphere; scorched comet-orchard fusion creates haunting sensory cohesion. Every detail enhances tone, with firelight and decay blending into a visceral, singular vision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich literary craftsmanship: metaphors are fresh ("embers cathedral"), themes resonate (rebellion via patience). Undermined slightly by over-reliance on ornate phrasing that occasionally obscures emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through precise imagery (e.g., "salvage of water"), but some phrases ("deliberate wilderness") verge on self-parody. Striking originality in framing rebellion as a slow, agrarian ritual.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not narratively; prose sings, but the story’s "impact" lacks narrative urgency for mass-market viability. A niche masterpiece, not a mainstream triumph.</comment>
