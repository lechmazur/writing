<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's unease is shown through actions and memories, but motivations remain abstract. Redemption arc hinted but underdeveloped; reactions to objects like coathanger reveal internal conflict but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional conflict/resolution, relying on vignettes. Orbital data and picnic rituals create cohesion, but fragmented structure risks incoherence. Pacing prioritizes mood over momentum; ends without distinct closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imaginative fusion of orbital debris tracking and domestic rituals creates immersive, haunting atmosphere. Metallic and oregano sensations ground surreal setting, though technological specifics remain vague.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (debris as human heartbreak, postcards as cosmic maps) create profound resonance. Theme of small acts as repair mechanisms transcends sci-fi tropes. Lyrical prose risks pretension but generally earns its emotionality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with inventive imagery, but some phrases ("method the kitchen taught him") strain credibility. Emotional nuance present but occasionally overshadowed by poetic flourishes that feel calculated rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptually daring but structurally unstable. Assigned elements weave through text like orbital debris - present but not always orbitally synchronized. Leaves intellectual impression rather than visceral impact.</comment>
