<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's traits are vividly shown through actions (scowling at starlings, softness for seedlings) but inner conflicts remain underdeveloped despite environmental metaphors. Motivation to change fate feels more thematic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression through memory and implication creates cohesive thematic flow. Subtle cause-effect (cafe encounter → beetle → transformation) avoids formulaic beats while maintaining integrity within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (brass shell "clicking like a tiny carnival," "heavy robes with morning mist") create a mythic yet tangible world where pollution and wonder coexist organically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors function as existential undercurrents rather than decorative flourishes. The metamorphosis reveals layered meaning about communal transformation without didacticism. Tension between resistance and embrace of responsibility lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids predictable arcs through poetic abstraction rather than strict plot mechanics. The blending of bureaucratic absurdity (accidental election) with mystical realism feels deliberately uncanny rather than algorithmically eclectic. No purple prose despite high lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Every element serves thematic architecture rather than feeling imposed. Timeframe creates urgency while allowing quiet character epiphany. Leaves residue of existential possibility rather than neat resolution.</grade>
