<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is intellectually stated but not deeply embodied; actions often feel like symbolic gestures rather than organic choices from a fully realized psychological landscape.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot structure relies on vague, poetic transitions rather than dramatic momentum; the mirror ritual's consequence is underdeveloped, leaving the ending inert rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("ivy-stitched tombs," "tobacco breath of solidarity chants") create intermittent atmosphere, but the protest/graveyard duality lacks cohesive tonal fusion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like the mirror as "a throat clearing" demonstrate linguistic ambition, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction; the central "conscience" metaphor hints at subtext without fully delivering it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The brewer's manifesto and "encroaching darkness" flirt with cliche; some imagery ("decorated with purpose") borders on self-seriousness rather than earned profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ideas about values and social decay feel forced through contrived set pieces; the protest's metronome-like chanting operates as an atmospheric device rather than narrative engine.</comment>
