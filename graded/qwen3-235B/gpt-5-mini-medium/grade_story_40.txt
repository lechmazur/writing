<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive but motivations remain abstract. "Tentatively fierce" is a poetic epithet rather than behavioral trait. Reincarnation aspect doesn't meaningfully shape actions or worldview.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weather-driven encounter initiates plot but connection between soldier and recipe-altering resolution feels thematically elegant rather than causally necessary. Pacing balances lyrical digressions with forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Milky surrealism avoids concrete sensory engagement. Setting functions primarily as metaphorical surface rather than inhabitable space with tactile details. Atmosphere impresses while evading specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphors "amputated traditions" and "salt to grief" demonstrate conceptual originality. Subtext about ritualized recovery/duty resonates beyond surface plot. Language elevates ordinary acts into philosophical meditation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Story avoids formula through unexpected metaphors (recipes as stories, soldiers as tradition relics) and restrained emotional expression. Style purposeful rather than ornate. Subtext emerges organically through objects rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stylistic brilliance contrasts with structural looseness. Assigned elements function more as thematic ornaments than narrative infrastructure. Brief length showcases poetic compression but weakens causal logic between key moments.</comment>
