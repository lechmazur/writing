<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's prudence shapes his subdued rituals and guarded curiosity, but inner conflicts remain abstract. Motivation to trace ancestry is consistent but lacks tangible emotional grounding beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently with a clear arc from tram to quay, but transitions feel slightly mechanical. Pacing is efficient, though the resolution relies on thematic resonance rather than earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid, original fusion of Minoan motifs with urban commuting—armor glowing under fluorescent lights, frescoes in ads—creating a haunting atmosphere that deepens the theme of hidden history.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is rich with layered metaphors and sensory details that evoke haunting subtext (grief-as-armor, lineage-as-pattern). Ending resonates as quiet revelation rather than melodrama, elevating its lyrical impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mingles originality (tram-bound knight decoding letters) with some overwritten phrases ("whispered into clay"). Avoids tropes but occasionally veers into vague mysticism that feels more aesthetic than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively around hidden histories, though the knight’s prudence and cheerfulness feel more symbolic than psychologically real. Lingering questions about identity and memory linger effectively.</comment>
