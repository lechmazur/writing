<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched but lacks emotional depth; motivations are hinted at through symbolism rather than earned through concrete psychological development. The "docile bruiser" concept is visually striking but under-explored in terms of internal conflict between those traits. Actions loosely connect to traits but rarely deepen them.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves with dreamlike logic but lacks tight cause-effect chains; key revelations (name discovery, plant reactions) feel more poetic than structurally necessary. The 500-word arc achieves thematic resonance but sacrifices narrative urgency, making pivotal moments feel unearned despite lyrical elegance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse atmosphere is visceral and original, with sensory details (drum solos as "impatient rain," chlorine-thick air) creating haunting immersion. The setting actively shapes plot and theme rather than merely framing action, particularly through plant behavior reflecting the character’s myth-building. Minor inconsistency: drum solos’ relevance feels more symbolic than integrated into physical space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with metaphors that deepen theme (e.g., "belief louder than returned corpse"), but emotional impact feels curated rather than earned—readers are shown awe without being immersed in it. Ending carries satisfying thematic resonance, though quieter moments could use subtler handling to avoid leaning on lyrical abstraction over character-specific stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagining "raising the dead" as myth-making, while the greenhouse setting avoids cliché through grotesque beauty. However, phrases like "soft danger" and "ancestral grammar" sometimes feel more atmospheric than purposeful, bordering on purple prose. Character motivation avoids trope reliance but could distinguish itself further from archetypal "mythmaker" stereotypes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around myth-building theme but unevenly integrate; the drum solos and treasure map feel more decorative than essential. Language barriers and baton drive momentum, while timeframe occasionally serves as convenient backdrop rather than shaping plot. Narrative economy is admirable but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative urgency.</comment>
