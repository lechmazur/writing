<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's "intelligently foolish" trait manifests in clever plans but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict; motivation to shift cosmic balance feels abstract rather than personal, reducing narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from figurine activation to corridor creation, but compressed structure leaves the "overthrow" resolution feeling abrupt rather than earned; high-concept scenes lack narrative breathing room.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rain-slick atmosphere and acoustic cave descriptions create visceral immersion, but post-empire setting remains underexplored as a decaying cultural/political entity rather than aesthetic backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Language dazzles with fractal metaphors and stone-song imagery, but intellectualized tone distances emotional engagement; ending's "exact, ridiculous intent" provides thematic closure without earned catharsis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality thrives in conceptual layering (shared taxi alibi plan, child equations), but risks poetic excess through over-embellished phrasing that occasionally obscures narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion emerges from thematic obsession with imbalance, but tight word count strains character-object connections; leaves intriguing questions about power redistribution rather than providing concrete resolution.</comment>
