<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivations are implied rather than embodied through actions or choices that distinguish him from archetypal tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plotted with elegant verbs but strained by word countâ€”resolution feels abrupt, causality between key-activation and mapping conclusion remains abstract.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich olfactory and tactile layering creates an immersive, haunting atmosphere; some metaphors ("whispers sharpened into warnings") verge on overworked abstraction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original conceit undercut by repetitive cadence and ornate phrasing ("neat calculations") that occasionally masks emotional vagueness rather than amplifying it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Element integration feels curated rather than organic; stylistic ambition occasionally overrides narrative cohesion despite evocative central metaphor.</comment>
