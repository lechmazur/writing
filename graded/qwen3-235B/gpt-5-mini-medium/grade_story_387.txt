<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Selfless musicality drives motives coherently, but lacks interiority; actions reflect altruistic mapping, yet character remains archetypal rather than psychologically textured.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot functions as iterative vignette rather than progression; lyrical repetition sustains thematic momentum but lacks traditional cause-effect arc within constrained form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship's sensory alchemy—solder/cedar, magnetic spindle's resonance—crafts visceral atmosphere; "savage grace" tonal dissonance slightly undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density (sound as rust-resistant cartography, migration as carved memory) operates on multiple symbolic layers; poetic cadence elevates thematic resonance despite minimal plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in vinyl-as-compass and chime-harmonic navigation transcends genre tropes; occasional adjectival excess ("intangibly tangible") risks ornamental overload.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>Story's mosaic structure coheres thematically but unevenly weights assigned elements; sensory tapestry lingers more than narrative teleology.</comment>
