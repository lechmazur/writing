<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but underdeveloped; motivation stated rather than dramatized; inconsistent voice between mythic abstraction and concrete gestures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uneven tone oscillates between fresh metaphors and overwrought abstraction; some phrases ("strange training still sang") suggest algorithmic residue; emotional nuance feels curated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</question><grade>Story generates transient mood over durable impact; elements coalesce into aesthetic rather than thematic unity; linguistic precision distracts from narrative vacancy.</grade>
