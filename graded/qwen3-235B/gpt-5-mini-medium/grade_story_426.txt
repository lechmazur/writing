<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character has intriguing traits but lacks emotional depth; motivations are implied through actions but not fully dimensionalized. Aloof passion and angry peacefulness remain more descriptive than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ghosts of past/future plot elements present within word limit, but pacing falters during transitions between marathon training and playlist subplots; resolution feels condensed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rust, camphor smells, and distorted carnival sounds create strong atmosphere, but the amusement park's haunted quality isn't fully leveraged for narrative tension or symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "quiet rituals" have potency; subtext about intangible heritage works well. However, excessive abstraction sometimes obscures emotional engagement despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uncommon combinations (botanical prodigy + digital sabotage) invigorate the narrative. Some phrases flirt with over-ornamentation but remain purposeful more often than not.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than average for an assignment-driven piece, though thematic weight occasionally overwhelms narrative urgency. Lingering resonance comes from atmosphere more than plot mechanics.</comment>
