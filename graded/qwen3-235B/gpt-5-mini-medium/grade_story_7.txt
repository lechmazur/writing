<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Abstract but underdeveloped character traits dominate; motivation hinted rhythmically rather than emotionally; actions (ritual gestures) align obliquely with stated goals but lack psychological depth; voice exists as poetic abstraction rather than individuated persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lacks conventional arc; exists as ritualistic tableau where action equals stasis; time flows but doesn't progress; thematic coherence over structural rigor; static pacing fits tone but subverts traditional plot expectations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exquisite sensorium—a cathedral of humming vats, phosphor-lit dew, clinking porcelain—merges industrial and sacred; setting as active participant; star-scorched ceilings and nectar-prayer sequencing create atmospheric logic that transcends exposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sustained metaphor mastery—chorus as machinery, healing as alchemy, ritual as industrial process; ending's threshold-burning pays off symbolic architecture; "showing" dominates through synesthetic imagery rather than explicating emotions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eccentric lexicon avoids generic formulations (compass dust, fossil constellations); emotional resonance emerges through juxtaposition, not declaration; avoids AI-adjacent banality but risks baroque excess; sublimates cliché into original mythic language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Highly cohesive despite element load, though some (cane/vats) serve thematic scaffolding better than others; form follows function but sacrifices visceral engagement; lingers as vivid impression rather than narrative conclusion.</comment>
