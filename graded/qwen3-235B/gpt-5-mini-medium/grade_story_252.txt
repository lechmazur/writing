<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's penitent arc and duality are evident, but emotional depth feels abstract and underexplored. The theft/redemption framework works, but internal nuance is sacrificed to poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but relies on atmospheric interludes over causal momentum. The petal-tracking method introduces elegant rhythm but risks plot stasis within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vault's sensory textures (frost, preserved fruit, creaking time) create an immersive, tactile atmosphere where icy and warm elements clash/coexist beautifully. Only minor disconnects in timeframe integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Breathtaking imagery and rich symbolism (block as key/apology, petals as temporal maps) deepen thematic resonance. The cyclical hush framing device and subtext about memory ethics linger provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh metaphors, though some phrases flirt with overworked poeticism. Emotional subtext is shown through action rather than stated, but occasional ornateness teeters near purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements serve a cohesive vision of guilt and restoration. Story's brief form feels intentional, with haunting metaphors and unresolved tensions between erasure/regrowth creating lasting resonance.</comment>
