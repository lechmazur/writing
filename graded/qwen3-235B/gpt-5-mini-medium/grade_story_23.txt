<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's actions and traits align but lack depth; motivation feels abstract rather than visceral. The bard remains an archetypal figure without psychological layers or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has circular logic but minimal dramaturgical tension. Ritual-like structure succeeds within constraints but lacks narrative urgency or irreversible change.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich, textured atmosphere merges sci-fi and myth. Sensory details like "copper leaves" and "lantern light" create a fully imagined liminal space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and lyrical cadences elevate the prose. Thematic coherence ties technology and renewal, though emotional resonance remains understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("sky accepted repair like a patient, dazzled guest") risk ornamental excess, but originality in blending ecology/machinery salvages. No AI formulae detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>Coherence exists, but story feels more like an illustrative vignette than self-contained narrative. Elements serve aesthetics over narrative momentum.</comment>
