<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters are vividly textured but motivation (preserving games) feels more thematic than deeply personal; brashness is consistent but lacks emotional layering beyond surface quirkiness</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Exquisite imagery undermines structural coherence; ritualistic climax lacks narrative progression - story is a singular mood piece rather than a shaped journey with rising tension</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere dominates over setting logic; peppermints/cardboard/fluorescent hum create immersive world-building, but the discount store never fully integrates with the mystical game mechanisms</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Florid descriptions often eclipse organic character psychology; some sensory details feel algorithmically generated ("sawdust and coal") rather than contextually earned</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Exquisite lyrical passages undermine cohesion; the element of a ritualistic game night works, but metalworking metaphors and retail setting clash tonally</comment>
