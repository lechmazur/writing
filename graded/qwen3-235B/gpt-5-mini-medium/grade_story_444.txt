<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character is consistent and poetic but lacks emotional depth and clear internal conflict; motivations are conceptually anchored to an abstract ideal rather than human-scale struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists only as a metaphorical loop; no clear arc or progression limits narrative engagement despite evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is intensely atmospheric, with sensory details that immerse the reader in a surreal, decaying world where history and dreams collide.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and conceptually resonant, with metaphors that linger, though emotional distance prevents deeper connection with the abstract protagonist.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with inventive metaphors, but some phrasing ('methodically playful,' 'calm frenzy') risks feeling like deliberate contradiction rather than organic insight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story is cohesive in execution but sacrifices narrative urgency for mood; the brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
