<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and consistently pursued, but psychological complexity feels implied rather than fully developed through situation/choices. Voice lacks distinctiveness in this 3rd-person poetic mode but shows consistency with the ethereal grit tone.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks traditional causality or transformation; more a succession of poetic tableaus. While thematic arc is present, it reads as vignette rather than fully realized narrative progression within the word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered with vivid sensory details that establish a world where light and darkness hold symbolic weight. The setting breathes with tactile specificity, from ozone/sugar smells to burn-marked counters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Storytelling impact derives from consistently applied metaphors where light represents hope/resistance. Lyrical prose and symbolic actions create emotional resonance that lingers. Subtext about cultural transformation through small acts elevates beyond surface plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines through inventive use of ordinary objects as profound symbols. Avoids clich√©s through specific, unexpected imagery. Language is ornate but purposefully stylized rather than purple prose, maintaining consistent tone and voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive despite many elements, each serving the theme of resistance through fragility. Style enhances rather than hinders clarity. Brief length feels purposeful, with lingering emotional impact through metaphorical framework.</comment>
