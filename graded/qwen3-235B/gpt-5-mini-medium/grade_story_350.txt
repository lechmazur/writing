<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but overly abstract; actions reveal traits but lack emotional depth. The "irritatingly perfect" album ties to his obsession but feels more symbolic than lived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured but relies on cryptic gestures over concrete cause/effect. The ending resolution feels abrupt, though the arc from grief to revelation is coherent within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visceral and immersive; sensory details (salt-vow silk, moonlight, temple acoustics) create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (stamps as "symphonies of truth") and musical lyricism elevate the prose. The ending’s thematic payoff about truth-as-performance is resonant, though occasionally obscured by dense imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original use of stamps/album and wedding gown as narrative devices; however, phrases like "irritatingly perfect" and "cella where stone shadows kept counsel" flirt with overwrought phrasing without collapsing into cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements blend into a cohesive, evocative whole. The tight word limit amplifies mystery rather than restricting it; the central theme of reclamation through fragmented truths lingers post-reading.</comment>
