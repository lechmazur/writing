<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically expressed but often conflated with abstract concepts—philosophically practical approach lacks nuanced psychological grounding. Telekinetic ability is central but becomes metaphorical rather than organically driving decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes suggest momentum but lack causal tension. The tapestry's cipher revelation and flame interaction create intriguing hooks, yet the narrative arc feels more like catalogued moments than a cohesive progression toward resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually visceral worldbuilding through sensory details (oilskin preservation, microtorch flame distortion) creates hauntingly hybrid medieval/space atmosphere. The navigation room's sacred disorder feels organically connected to both character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Symbolism of dragons-as-agricultural-knowledge and tree-planting-as-future are executed with layered subtext. The linguistic mapping of phonemes to woven ciphers demonstrates sophisticated intellectual architecture beneath the surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Occasional overelaboration ("whispered secrets" repetition) threatens to become tics, but the fusion of mystical farming terminology with cyberpunk elements feels purposefully disruptive rather than formulaic. Emotional resonance is subtly implied through gestures rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Despite dense conceptual layering, the story maintains thematic unity through recurring motifs of preservation. The short form works advantageously here—each paragraph functions as concentrated thematic capsule rather than diluted summary.</comment>
