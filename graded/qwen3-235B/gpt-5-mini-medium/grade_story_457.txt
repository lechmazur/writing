<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character exists as a collection of idiosyncrasies without psychological depth; motivation to "forge new paths" feels abstractly stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; momentum exists through atmospheric accumulation rather than narrative causality; circular structure risks feeling static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory layering creates a tactile universe; neon's tang, subway pigeon sighs, zipper pull's apologetic jingle crystallize the setting's existential texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise elevated by unconventional metaphors ("neon on tongue," "folding heroes in margins"); occasional ornate phrasing threatens to become self-indulgent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outweighs emotional immediacy; elements combine cleverly but create an elegant construct rather than a resonant experience; style occasionally outpaces substance.</comment>
