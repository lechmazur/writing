<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains a fragmented concept; actions and psyche are driven by the assigned elements but lack deep emotional grounding or evolution beyond setting up the plot's poetic machinery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic arc, but lacks narrative pressure; the DNA-to-harmonics sequence feels abstracted from stakes, leaving coherence dependent on lyrical prose rather than causal progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Neon orchard's sensory overload creates vivid atmosphere, but cyberpunk underworld remains ornamental; fails to integrate fully with the story's thematic ambitions, existing largely as a backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and emotional undercurrents suggest depth, but relies too heavily on linguistic density to obscure structural thinness; the ending lands as a conceptual coup, not an earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original use of DNA sonification concept is clever, but overwrought prose and clich√©d "sympathetic magic" redemption arc veer into pretension; emotional beats are stated, not earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>High-concept elements overwhelm cohesion; story reads as a proof-of-concept for a larger idea rather than a self-contained narrative of publishable rigor or clarity.</comment>
