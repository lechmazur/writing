<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's joviality isn't clearly established despite "precarioulsy confident" gestures. Motivation to "negotiate with darkness" remains abstract and disconnected from tangible emotional stakes, though his technical actions align with the blacksmith motif. Minimal internal conflict undermines depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The action (building a lamp) drives the plot, but the connection between his endurance and the climax is vague. The metronome device attempts cohesion but undermines pacing—ending feels abrupt rather than earned. Tightening cause/effect logic would enhance structural clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting details (oil, coal dust, ticking devices) create vivid immersion. The "final wave" timeframe evokes transience, but its relationship to the blacksmith's task feels symbolic rather than functional. Atmosphere excels, but the setting doesn't actively shape the plot beyond mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery ("invention is a stubborn prayer") elevates thematic depth. The ending avoids sentimentality, but emotional resonance is limited by the character's affectless narration. The central metaphor (darkness/light) is compelling though undercut by didacticism in dialogues about "human condition."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avant-garde metaphors ("gears pausing for a beat") feel fresh, but excessive abstraction ("fervent indifference") borders on pretension. Avoids cliché through lyrical precision, though some sensory details ("coal dust clinging like memory") veer into poetic excess without sufficient narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Technical cohesion from tightly braided motifs (darkness/endurance/metronome) but uneven thematic integration. The brevity serves the solitary protagonist's focus yet feels incomplete—major themes lack the complexity they deserve. Lingering impact resides in metaphors over character.</comment>
