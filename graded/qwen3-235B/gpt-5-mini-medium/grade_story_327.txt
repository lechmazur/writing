<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Restless conjurer's motivation to turn imagination into reality is clear but underexplored; actions show determination but lack emotional depth. The 'restless' attribute manifests visually but doesn't drive internal conflict or significant character transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arc from blank card to pearl creation is cohesive but feels compressed; cause/effect between road closure and conjurer's triumph remains underdeveloped. Pacing balances lyrical moments with narrative progression within constraints but lacks urgency despite time-sensitive elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sensory details like "kelp-wrapped tranquility" and "moonlight rope" immerse readers. Cave setting visually supports concept but never directly challenges the conjurer's magic. Atmosphere enhances mood but rarely interacts with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("torches as soft bells") and cyclical structure elevate craft. Subtext about creativity under constraint resonates, though emotional beats about legacy remain told rather than shown. Ending feels inevitable yet poetic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some phrases ("complexly simple," "layered tranquility") verge on empty lyricism, but the cave school's originality saves it. Avoids most clich√©s through unique imagery but occasionally prioritizes style over clarify. Tension between tradition/invention feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Story maintains cohesion through recurring motifs despite high-concept density. Elements like the fading reflection propel the narrative but could feel less ritualized. Lingering resonance stems from poetic language rather than thematic complexity.</comment>
