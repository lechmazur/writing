<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Limited character definition; actions and traits remain abstract, more symbolic than fully realized. Motivation is clear but underexplored in emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Surreal progression lacks concrete stakes or causality; structure exists but feels amorphous. Conceptual momentum occasionally falters under disjointed imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with tactile sensory details; haunted cellar and mosaic realities create a haunting, layered environment sustained throughout.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and metaphors (e.g., "rewrite grief into tune") elevate thematic depth; emotional impact is diffuse rather than piercing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original concept execution, but some ornate phrasing borders on self-indulgent. Unique voice balances against occasional poetic abstraction typical of algorithmic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive in tone and theme despite elements; experimental style might polarize. Leaves lingering resonance through metaphor, not plot.</comment>
