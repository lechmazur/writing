<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has stylized, poetic traits but lacks emotional depth; the concept-driven motivation feels more thematic than personal; has distinct voice but relies heavily on metaphorical descriptions rather than nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plothas loose, vignette-like structure that creates poetic cohesion but lacks traditional narrative beats; progression from night to dawn creates a sense of change, but lacks concrete transformation or tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Has atmospheric details but leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than physical immersion; "night workers" and diner setting create mood but lack specificity that would make them feel lived-in and authentic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of literary devices creates strong impact; metaphors like "throne of reason" and "jester cushions" resonate; ending effectively encapsulates the story's themes; shows rather than tells through symbolic storytelling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with its fresh perspective on anxiety; uses some AI-like poetic abstraction but generally avoids repetitive phrases; metaphors feel original but occasionally overreach; balances poetic style with emotional resonance in most areas.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story has cohesive thematic framework; some elements feel more conceptually driven than organically integrated; experimental form aligns with theme but could better serve emotional weight; leaves lingering thoughts about communal anxiety and healing.</comment>
