<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paper-thin character defined by abstract phrasing over concrete actions; motivation implied through metaphor rather than tangible choices; no discernible arc, just existential repetition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No plot progression, just cyclical gestures; surreal flourishes obscure structural incoherence; lacks clear beginning/middle/end; "countdown" device never pays narrative dividends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (peeling posters, ozone scent) create haunting atmosphere; setting as decaying liminal space perfectly mirrors thematic stagnation; some dream-logic elements strain credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical density creates lingering resonance; language elevates premise beyond gimmickry; emotional connection remains intellectualized rather than visceral; ending circles back effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Phrases like "drainingly invigorated" walk tightrope between brilliance and pretension; avoids predictable plot beats but sometimes substitutes poetic abstraction for authentic human dimensionality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work as thematic scaffolding rather than checklist fulfillment; brevity enhances conceptual purity; style occasionally overpowers emotional substance.</comment>
