<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by occasional over-writing; some phrases like "mosaics suggested rivers that never had to be mended" feel overly ornate rather than organically poetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements work in concert despite contrived premise; thematic unity between guilt, restoration, and "logically illogical" mechanics creates memorable conceptual resonance.</comment>
