<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits (shyness, cosmic fixation) are present but underdeveloped; motivations are intriguingly abstract yet lack psychological depth; connection between her method and personality remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure has thematic cohesion and cyclical logic, but the high-concept through-line (social media breadcrumbs) strains credibility within the confined space; shifts between timelines could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vividly realized oceanic decay with tactile details (oilskin, brine-slick tables), but atmospheric elements rarely deepen character or conflict; the setting’s beauty doesn't fully intertwine with emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness (ledger-line souls, tidal timelines) lingers conceptually; the ending’s resonant metaphor of "names returned" elevates the craft beyond mere surrealism into philosophical territory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through quantum-adjacent mythmaking; the social media/timeline interplay feels inventively non-AI in its thematic collision; language occasionally veers toward ornate detachment but serves the character’s emotional repression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements function in service of the ledger-realignment theme; some assigned props (specific photographs) integrate more organically than others (social media’s persistence in a drowned market); ambitious fusion of modern and mythic rarely falters.</comment>
