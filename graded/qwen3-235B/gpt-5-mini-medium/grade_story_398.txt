<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but lacks depth; sincerity drives actions but isn't fully realized beyond symbolic gestures. Motivation is clear but underexplored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are generally cohesive but uneven in integration; the story feels intentionally compressed yet occasionally strained by thematic density.</comment>
