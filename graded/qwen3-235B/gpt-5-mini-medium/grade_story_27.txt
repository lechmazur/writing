<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and curse are central to actions but lack psychological depth; motivations are consistent but thinly rendered, with reactions to assigned elements (feather, tapestry) feeling symbolic rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the petrification sequence drives momentum yet sacrifices cause-effect clarity for moon-phase logic; connections between haunted booth and birdwatchers' subsequent evolution are vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive with visceral details (popcorn ghosts, resin scent) and haunting duality between carnival decay and natural cycles; birdwatching timeframe contrasts stagnant vs. evolving states through precise atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry as moral loom, petrification as truth's weight) resonate through layered subtext; ending delivers quiet catharsis where wingbeats symbolize transformation, aligning surface action with existential themes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending mythic logic (curse mechanics) with concrete imagery; avoids clichés through specific, disquieting details (petrified vendor as "frozen syllable"). Lacks slight tonal consistency in balancing lyricism with narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around transformation theme but uneven execution—moon-phase magic disrupts internal logic; brief format accentuates poetic strengths and structural weaknesses equally; leaves intellectual afterimage rather than emotional imprint.</comment>
