<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but remains static; motivations are clear yet lack emotional resonance. The assigned attribute is thematically consistent but underexplored in inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates ingenuity, though pacing stumbles in compressed scenes. The method of rebellion feels logically sound within the world but relies on slight narrative hand-waving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion creates a cohesive dreamlike atmosphere, though some elements (time machine, shadows) risk tonal dissonance without clearer thematic reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors bloom with poetic precision; the ending achieves haunting economy. The central theme of idea-propagation-as-rebellion resonates powerfully through layered symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story transcends gimmickry through thematic cohesion, though the brevity sometimes forces superficial execution of complex ideas. Lingering impact stems more from style than sustained emotional investment.</comment>
