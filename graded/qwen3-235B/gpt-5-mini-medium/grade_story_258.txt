<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve dances is clear and thematically resonant, but interiority feels sparse - motivations are stated more than demonstrated through impactful choices. The "nimble" trait is visually expressed but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elegant circular structure (leaf drop as beginning/end) anchors the narrative, but the connection between the storm of secrets and the dance revival feels conceptually underdeveloped. Tension remains diffuse despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative setting achieves cohesion through tactile sensory details (tide-chart fingers, sea-slick planks) and metaphorical logic - driftwood foundation mirrors fragile cultural preservation. Atmosphere consistently reinforces thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("fingers precise as tide charts") and subtext about cultural erasure create lingering impact. Some emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction rather than earned catharsis, slightly diluting resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing with fresh imagery (e.g., "yearbooks hummed like moths"), though the "jaded wonder" tone occasionally verges on affectation. Some descriptions verge on ornate but rarely obscure narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite fantastical elements - every detail (map, oak, yearbooks) ties into cultural preservation theme. The brief length feels intentional, though ending's return of elders strains suspension of disbelief slightly.</comment>
