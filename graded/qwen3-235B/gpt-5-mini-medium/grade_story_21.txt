<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's actions align with "measured diplomat" trait, but internal monologue remains opaque, relying on abstract descriptors ("abrasive calm") without sufficient behavioral grounding. Motivation to decode genetics ties to revenge but lacks emotional dimensionality beyond intellectualized conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure pivots on one decisive moment, but pacing stumbles in middle exposition. Genetic pattern pursuit drives plot, yet denouement's abruptness undercuts emotional weight. Concept shapes arc but resolution feels imposed rather than earned within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory atmosphere through "shuttered theater's must," "powdered skylights," and drum-circle rhythms creates immersive decay. Tone contrasts effectively with setting's tension. Some details verge on excessive ornamentation without payoff (e.g., "genetic patterns the city archivists whispered about").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("revenge tasted like ledger ink") and layered symbols (tassel's duality) create thematic resonance. Conflict between science/mercy emerges clearly, though subtext about political repercussions feels underdeveloped. Voice maintains consistent, haunting tone; ending provides thematic closure but minimal emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrases ("human scale eclipsed scientific," "hereditary whispers") lean toward pretentious abstraction. Avoids major tropes, but "bandit's jest" and "diplomat's internal struggle" border on familiar archetypes. Emotional nuance emerges through action (discarding the tassel) rather than mere description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements work collectively despite occasional contrivance (fox-tail's synthetic organics). Narrative momentum prioritizes thematic density over organic character psychology. The story's brevity enhances its philosophical focus, leaving lingering questions about truth's cost without glib resolution.</comment>
