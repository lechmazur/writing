<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's abstract motivations and traits are poetically rendered but lack emotional anchor; "baffled" and "confusingly lucid" are conceptually rich but underdeveloped in concrete behavioral terms. The dummy's role as a dialogue partner remains symbolic rather than revealing nuanced character depth. Transformation is intellectualized over lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot substitutes thematic momentum for traditional narrative arc; poetic acts shape atmosphere but fail to create clear causality or stakes. The lighthouse-as-metaphor evolves coherently, yet lack of conflict resolution feels intentional rather than insufficient. Pacing prioritizes linguistic texture over dramatic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haunting industrial setting achieves visceral intensity through precise tactile details (grease, heat) and uncanny juxtapositions (ghostlight, metaphorical machines). The engine room becomes a synesthetic character itself, where even condensate "writes" poetry, creating an immersive liminal space that transcends standard Gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with inventive metaphors ("scorching poise," "paper ghosts of doctrine") that transform theft into metaphysical inquiry. Subtext about language as rebellion resonates, though emotional impact is muted by stylistic abstraction. The ending lands as both culmination and invitation, rewarding careful reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High stylistic originality avoids genre clich√©s, yet occasionally tips into ornamental density that obscures emotional clarity. Some phrases ("subsonic hum," "fissure of recognition") feel self-indulgent, while the core idea of poetry as subversion remains compellingly fresh. Nuance exists in thematic contrasts rather than psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story uses restrictive parameters as creative catalysts, weaving assigned elements into a cohesive tapestry of ideas about power and perception. While the experimental structure may alienate some readers, the deliberate fragmentary rhythm and metaphor-as-plot succeed in transforming constraints into artistic liberty.</comment>
