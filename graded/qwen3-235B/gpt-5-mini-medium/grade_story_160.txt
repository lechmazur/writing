<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's analytical freedom and defiance of finality are consistently portrayed, but motivation remains abstract. Internal contradictions (prickly wonder vs. mechanical duty) hint at depth but lack concrete grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows through tactile rituals to engine revival, but lacks emotional stakes despite elegant pacing. Abrupt ending lacks payoff for structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive atmosphere with rust/cologne echoes and sleeping zeppelins. Theatrical decay contrasts with mechanical resurgence magnificently.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose shines with tactile metaphors and thematic symmetry between performance closure and mechanical resurrection. Ending resonates intellectually but lacks emotional ballast.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in texture but flirts with purple prose ("prickly wonder bloom"). Avoids most clich√©s but analytical detachment creates emotional distance typical of experimental fiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Successfully weaves elements into haunting meditation on impermanence. While lacking traditional narrative payoff, lingers conceptually through poetic interweaving of decay and rebirth metaphors.</comment>
