<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched through symbolic gestures and intellectual drive but lacks psychological depth; motivation to decode rock art is clear but abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Minimal plot; relies on thematic repetition rather than dramatic progression, undermining structural rigor; the cyclical emphasis on pauses and decoding creates circularity rather than momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered through tactile details (comb's moonlight, stone hum) and mythic-tinged setting; environment and metaphor merge to evoke intellectual obsession and impermanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and floral/rock art parallels create intellectual resonance; ending achieves thematic closure through pattern resolution; emotional impact is cerebral rather than visceral, which suits the conceptual premise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through surreal combinations but occasionally lapses into ornamental abstraction ("watcher's burden" as diffuse metaphor); road trip element feels contrived; metaphors prioritize aesthetic over psychological authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>Coherence emerges from thematic unity despite minimal plot; brevity amplifies the enigmatic tone; conceptually driven but risk-taking elevates it beyond mere assemblage of elements.</comment>
