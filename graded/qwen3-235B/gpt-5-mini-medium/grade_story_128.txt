<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Surface-level motivation ("see through unfiltered eyes") lacks emotional depth; character defined more by conceptual role than organic traits. Assigned attributes shape actions but lack psychological resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on poetic juxtapositions but lacks cause-effect logic; resolution feels preordained by theme rather than earned through narrative. Fragmented structure sacrifices coherence for symbolism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (smoke, alabaster, cracked screen) build haunting atmosphere. Ancient setting juxtaposed with anachronistic elements generates tension but weakens historical grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose elevates thematic cohesion; ending reverberates through layered imagery. Occasional obscurity dilutes emotional immediacy despite lyrical strengths.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending TV subtitles with ancient narrative; avoids clich√©s through surreal, unexpected combinations. Language never feels derivative despite occasional ornamental flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant surface obscures thin emotional core. Elements cohere thematically but sacrifice character dimensionality and grounded narrative progression.</comment>
