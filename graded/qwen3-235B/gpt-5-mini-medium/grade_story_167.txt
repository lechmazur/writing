<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but internally unexamined; actions align with assigned traits but lack emotional texture; the 'uncommonly typical' attribute remains superficially performed rather than earned through psychological complexity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot advances through restrained, methodical actions but the circular ending creates a sense of stasis rather than resolution; cause-effect logic holds but tension dissipates in final paragraphs; time-loop implications hinted but not capitalized on</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges sterile futurism with visceral intimacy through sensory details (temporal currents vs. the warmth of metal); setting functions as second character; gravity-as-lullaby metaphor is hauntingly executed</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor layers (coils as second throats, contamination as mercy) create thematic resonance; ending's emotional register teeters between transcendence and ambiguity without fully committing either; shows vs. tells in nuanced balance</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally succumbs to lyrical overreach ("whispered histories fold into daylight"); emotional restraint feels authentically human; the "old well" method edges toward mythic cliche but redeems itself through metallic sensory grounding</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere through tonal consistency despite ambitious concept density; the capsule hotel's temporal bureaucracy serves as effective narrative skeleton; leaves questions about institutional mechanics that exceed brief's constraints</comment>
