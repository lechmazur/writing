<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's ambiguous morality lacks sufficient integration with his actions; motivations are intriguing but underdeveloped, with symbolic gestures substituting for psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through decoding the seed packets, but the abrupt shift to the smoke tower and unresolved ending create a sense of incompletion within the constrained timeframe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (dust/sea smells, fogged windows) create immersive atmosphere, but grocery store-to-tower transition sacrifices spatial coherence for symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Balances assigned elements competently but unevenlyâ€”some (xerograph, seed packets) are indispensable while others (grocery shopping) feel perfunctorily integrated.</comment>
