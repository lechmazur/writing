<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inner conflict is clear but lacks dynamic evolution, reliance on telling vs. showing through introspection weakens emotional investment in motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Arc is implied rather than structured; atmospheric moments replace plot progression, creating episodic fragmentation within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (chalk, salt, bells) create a haunting, specific atmosphere; the setting's physical and emotional textures are masterfully interwoven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (paths as gardener, rituals as "living threads") provide deep thematic resonance; ending's quiet triumph feels earned through accumulated subtextual layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Economical language with minimal purple prose, though some abstract phrasing ("cheerful gloom") risks poetic conventionality; emotional nuance emerges through concrete gestures rather than stated dichotomies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element cohesion is impressive, but the story's static quality and minimal narrative propulsion limit its potential for sustained literary conversation.</comment>
