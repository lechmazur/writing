<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is thematically consistent but underdeveloped; motivations regarding "language of the soul" feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded; interactions with stranger lack emotional layering despite strong conceptual hooks.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has thematic momentum through tile's history and character growth, but the tight arc occasionally strains under compressed dialogue and under-explained transitions; resolution feels conceptually satisfying but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stylistic richness in neon corridors and synthetic incense contrasts unevenly with generic "artificially tamed wind" details; atmosphere evokes mood but inconsistent sensory specificity weakens full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical integration of maps, memory, and the napkin-boat ritual succeeds; subtext about tangible emotional geographies resonates; dialogue occasionally prioritizes thematic weight over naturalism; ending avoids sentimentality but feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in blending cartography with memory rituals stands out; avoids generic melancholy through tactile details (glaze heat/grief as map-readable data); some phrases ("eager resignation") recur like refrains rather than organic voice; emotional nuance present but occasionally flattened by thematic emphasis.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements mostly coalesce around existential navigation theme; "inconspicuously blatant" feels conceptually underexploited; length works but reveals structural scaffolding in crossroads exposition; prompts reflection on memory's materiality without descending into pure abstraction.</comment>
