<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits shape her actions well (academic past informs postcard use), and motivation to restore faith is clear, but some attributes feel imposed rather than organically revealed through actions. Nuance in internal conflict could deepen the portrayal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression but creates thematic momentum through cyclical actions. The chalkboard as through-line works, but tight word limit weakens the sense of narrative arc and cause-effect clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (attic dust smell, fireflies as votive lamps, shaky chalk epigraphs) amplify mood effectively. Fireflies and seasonal setting enhance atmosphere but remain peripheral to plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic prose elevates thematic cohesion (e.g., "thrifted sentences as scaffolding for renewal"). Ending resonates metaphorically, but the story avoids explicit conflict, relying on lyrical abstraction over narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids expected tropes through original metaphors (postcards as "compressed novellas," fireflies as punctuation). Language occasionally leans into stylized abstraction ("bruised exhilaration") but maintains voice distinctiveness without feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively (postcards, chalkboard, fireflies unify theme), but the storyâ€™s brevity sacrifices narrative urgency for lyrical density. Lingers beautifully but risks feeling too self-consciously symbolic to meet strict publishability standards.</comment>
