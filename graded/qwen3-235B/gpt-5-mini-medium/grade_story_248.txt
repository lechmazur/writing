<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Characters function more as symbolic objects than living entities; motivations exist but are subsumed by poetic abstraction rather than psychological realism or compelling existential stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant miniature arc compressed into liminal space; structural cohesion emerges paradoxically from the emphasis on fragmentation, though some causal logic dissipates in the conceptual density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Radiant atmospheric cohesion through tactile metaphors (glass air, taste of coolant) and quantum-mystical interplay between derelict machinery and cosmic-scale stakes creates vivid, unforgettable psychic space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Profound thematic resonance between form and content (letters as fate, rearrangement as defiance), with lyrical precision sustaining emotional weight beneath abstraction; ending's bittersweet synthesis of truth and consequence achieves transcendent minimalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal synthesis of sci-fi and mythopoeic elements; occasional ornateness serves thematic purpose (entropy, misinterpretation) rather than empty flourish; emotional subtext emerges through structural silences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Beneath metaphysical shimmer lies a technically masterful but emotionally guarded narrative; cohesion triumphs over assigned constraints but sacrifices some visceral urgency in favor of cerebral resonance.</grade>
