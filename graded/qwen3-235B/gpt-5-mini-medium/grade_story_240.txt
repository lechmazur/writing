<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually layered but rendered abstractly; the soothsayer’s internal conflict lacks concrete emotional grounding despite poetic descriptions of his methods.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Non-linear structure and thematic repetition compensate for compressed arc; resolution with the sapling introduces tension but feels abrupt rather than inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and immersive; the gnarled village’s tactile details (e.g., “woven bark and iron”) and tonal resonance with “dreadful hope” create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphor (“song as schematics”) and existential tension elevate the story; the ending’s thematic payoff (miracles as accountability) resonates beyond its allegorical surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids cliche through surreal precision, though occasional phrasing (“terrible patience”) veers toward abstraction without sufficient emotional context; largely fresh metaphors (e.g., “steam sang back like obligation”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements feel conceptually fused but occasionally thematic overreach undermines cohesion; brevity enhances lyrical impact, though some connections (e.g., memory/timeframe) remain underexplored.</comment>
