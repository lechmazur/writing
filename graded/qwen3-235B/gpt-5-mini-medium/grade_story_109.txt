<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical traits are intriguing but underdeveloped; some motivations feel imposed by plot devices rather than organically expressed, particularly the knight's duality in a modern setting.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Meandering structure lacks clear narrative progression; atmospheric vignette qualities compensate somewhat, but plot mechanics remain nebulous despite effective imagery anchoring the theme of quiet care.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elegant descriptions create mood, but worldbuilding inconsistencies disrupt immersion (medieval knighthood vs bureaucratic espionage) and sensory details lack tangible specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layering elevates craft—particularly altar-as-painting and knightly-vulnerability motifs; subtext about institutional healing resonates through precise, controlled prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unexpected juxtapositions (bureaucratic healing rituals); some overwritten passages threaten to tip into purple prose but maintain just enough tonal restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uneven execution—while thematic threads around care and secrecy are compelling, structural choices feel dictated by assignment constraints rather than creative imperative.</comment>
