<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is compelling yet underdeveloped; his naivety and unlucky traits drive motivation but lack psychological depth. Actions align with traits but feel more symbolic than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but structurally fragmented; plot moves from desire to discovery but suffers from vague progression and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich atmosphere occasionally devolves into aesthetic over-engineering; sensory details immerse but occasionally feel self-indulgent rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly evocative language with potent metaphors (wind as syntax, scars as musical notation) creates enduring unease and hope, though thematic clarity falters slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional purple prose and formulaic phrasing ("laughing salted the air"); metaphors like chimes-as-language are fresh but inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in tone but uneven in execution; ambitious themes outpace narrative containment, leaving poetic fragments without visceral resonance or structural rigor.</comment>
