<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is distinct but motivations lack psychological depth; the swordsman's grace and discipline are tied to his actions but his internal struggles remain abstract and generalized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc from innovation to unintended consequences to resolution, but pacing leans on poetic abstraction rather than narrative urgency; the ending feels earned but not fully earned through conventional plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially cohesive world-building with the ocean ruins, corrupted technology, and eerie synesthesia of bird songs; the setting operates as a character itself, shaping the protagonist's tools and conflicts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative prose with layered metaphors (broadcasts as "static landscapes," blades as "metronomes") and resonant themes of resisting conformity through fragmented creation; the ending's "true human broadcast that sounded like breathing" lingers as profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linguistically inventive but occasionally veers into self-satisfied lyricism ("contagious insistence on sameness that slid like oil into his compositions") that prioritizes sound over earned emotional weight; some AI-like cadences in repetitive structure of cause-effect sequences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a thematically unified whole, though the story occasionally relies on linguistic virtuosity over structural efficiency; the brevity works as an intentional stylistic choice rather than a limitation.</comment>
