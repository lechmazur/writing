<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prince's exile and mortar/pestle connection to mother provide emotional logic, but his regal background lacks contextual weight. The "unintentionally iconic" attribute manifests through the stranger's gaze rather than the prince's intrinsic traits, making it feel externally imposed rather than organically developed through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The snowstorm's chance encounter drives the plot, while the turning key creates temporal urgency. The tightly-wound structure compresses emotional arc effectively within word limits though the ritualistic powder's transformation feels abrupt without clearer cause-effect mechanics connecting it to the metaphysical shift in the final scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sensory alchemy through porcelain clinks and thyme scent creates visceral immersion. The abandoned customs office's decaying officialdom contrasts beautifully with mystical elements. The "familiar unknown" tone crystallizes in how storm intrudes on institutional ruin, making exile tangible as both physical space and metaphysical state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors like "umbrella as accidental chapel" create haunting resonance. The central theme of ritualized healing through shared witness emerges organically. Subtext of bureaucratic magic in "customs ledgers" and "official papers" adds unexpected depth, though emotional beats rely too heavily on descriptive abstraction over concrete character choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids easy archetypes through specific alchemical logic and bureaucratic decay imagery. Some phrases like "weather worn like garments" risk poetic overfamiliarity. The stranger's instant philosophical symmetry with the prince risks feeling contrived. Emotional progression blends show-don't-tell principle with occasional overabstraction, but maintains human texture beneath lyrical veneer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically - exile's mortar becomes communal cure, storm creates narrative vessel, sealing key completes transformation. The "cure through recognition" theme emerges organically. Tight structure never feels constricted, though the stranger remains more symbolic force than fully fleshed presence within the limited space.</comment>
