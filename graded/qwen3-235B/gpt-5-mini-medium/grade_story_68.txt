<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's moral code and motivation are clear but underexplored; her actions align with her traits, but emotional depth is sacrificed for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc but feels compressed; the connection between tea-steeping and the technical process is underdeveloped, and the resolution arises abruptly without sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, unique setting with sensory details and genre-blending, but the Roman elements feel more aesthetic than culturally integrated, weakening thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and layered symbolism elevate the story, but emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction rather than earned, visceral impact; the ending suggests depth without fully delivering it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with hybridized worldbuilding, but "woven circuits," "cat's snarl," and overly intricate mechanics verge on tech-poetic ornamentation rather than purposeful invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Concepts are tightly woven, but pacing and underdeveloped themes prevent transcendent cohesion; the ending gestures at philosophical potency without fully realizing it.</comment>
