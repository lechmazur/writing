<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's late-blooming heroism and obsession with cosmic balance are conceptually strong but lack visceral emotional grounding; motivations are cerebral rather than human-scaled.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>No traditional plot progression; cohesive as lyrical meditation but sacrifices dramatic urgency; repetitive circling of themes weakens tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ruined city's fossilized seas, rusted hinges, and solar panels create hauntingly tactile atmosphere; sensory details immerse but occasionally overwhelm narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (loss as measurable growth, spyglass as tool for microcosmic order); ending crystallizes theme powerfully; risks didacticism but earns resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Occasional overreliance on abstract phrasing ("architecture of cosmic balance") and overdetermined metaphors; mostly avoids AI-adjacent clich√©s but flirtation with mannerism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere through metaphysical throughline; brevity sharpens its poetic focus; sacrifices narrative specificity but achieves thematic unity.</comment>
