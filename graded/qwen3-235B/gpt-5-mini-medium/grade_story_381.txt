<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character defined more by metaphor than substance; motivation implied through poetic association but lacks visceral emotional grounding, nuance in relating to assigned objects, or convincing behavioral patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot eschews traditional structure for lyrical abstraction; momentum exists in sensory impression rather than cause-effect logic, making it feel ephemeral despite intentional pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's crowning achievement—sensory details like ozone-tinged ink and refracted dialogue crystallize into a haunting, otherworldly environment that transcends genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose exhibits virtuosic control; metaphors (undead maps, noir cadence as technical tool) are revelatory. Ending's "mapped silence" delivers philosophical heft through negative space rather than explicit resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through surreal juxtaposition but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing that strains toward profundity. Subtext feels intentional rather than algorithmic, though precision occasionally falters.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>ELEMENTS INTEGRATED INTO A WHOLE THAT TRANSCENDS "COHESION"—THIS WORKS AS PROSE-PERFORMANCE WHERE TECHNICAL CONVENTIONS MATTER LESS THAN RHYTHMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN TERMINOLOGY AND TONE.</comment>
