<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic rather than fully realized; motivations (gloating over survival, emotional detachment) lack depth despite atmospheric integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative tension between personal survival and shared escape is clear, but pacing stumbles in midsection due to abrupt conceptual shifts (e.g., avalanche as both literal/metaphorical device).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Setting relies on over-familiar dystopian tropes (neon decay, vertical slums) with insufficient specificity to differentiate from genre defaults; sensory details overwhelm rather than enhance atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Transcendent use of metaphor (recipe as prophecy, collapse as destiny) creates thematic resonance; sparse but purposeful language elevates emotional subtext beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality in linking culinary imagery to urban decay and emotional dislocation; prose avoids excess ornamentation despite density, with consistent tone and inventively twisted clichés ("destiny written in margins").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Premises intertwine effectively, but the story’s abstract core and elliptical structure may alienate readers seeking narrative closure or concrete stakes.</comment>
