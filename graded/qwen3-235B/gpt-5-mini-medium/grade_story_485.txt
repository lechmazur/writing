<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's brazenness and impulsivity are evident but motivation (redemption/self-punishment) feels implied rather than deeply explored through actionable choices; the charcoal ritual connects to his past but inner conflict lacks textured emotional realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot advances through symbolic action of drawing the sigil but lacks dynamic progression; beginning/middle/end structure exists abstractly rather than through concrete narrative stakes; coherence maintained despite compressed arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting with salinated corrosion and coral decay; oceanic metaphors amplify themes; atmosphere supports tone but timeframe tensions feel underexploited</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("charcoal sigil as apology") and subtextual exploration of betrayal/redemption resonate beyond plot; poetic cadences and symbolic acts create lingering impact despite minimal action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally lapses into mannered prose ("candle in tidewater"); avoids genre tropes yet occasionally prioritizes lyrical flourishes over narrative clarity</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly drive narrative; some aspects (social upheaval) underdeveloped; stylistic ambition elevates structural limitations</grade>
