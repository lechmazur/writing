<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's ethically questionable nature and cosmic wonder motivation are consistent but thinly developed; actions align with traits but lack interiority to deepen engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through deliberate, symbolic actions but feels compressed; the etchings’ effect on guests lacks concrete cause/effect progression, slightly undermining coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Jazz Age time capsule evokes era-specific atmosphere but underutilizes sensory details; numb fascination is conveyed through vague descriptors rather than visceral immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric language (e.g., "semantic rust") elevates impact; ending resolves thematically but lacks emotional weight; subtext about questioning reality is effective but understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors counteract some predictable beats; ethical ambiguity avoids cliché; "numb fascination" is specific but occasionally veers into abstract vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; jazz age setting doesn’t fully integrate with core tensions; the story’s ambition exceeds its narrative execution.</comment>
