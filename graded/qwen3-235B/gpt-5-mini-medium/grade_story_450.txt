<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s intelligence contrasts with linguistic struggles, creating nuanced emotional tension. Motivation for fulfilling prophecy is clear but lacks depth in emotional payoff. Internal conflict is strong, but the arc feels compact rather than fully developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot relies on internal transformation over external events, making the arc feel incomplete. Prophecy resolution is conceptually satisfying but structurally abrupt. Pacing is thoughtful but lacks narrative momentum due to minimal action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Antiseptic-citrus scent, humming simulations, and blurred steam create a vivid, mood-enhancing setting. The chamber’s design ties to the conceptual weight of denial, though some elements feel conceptually borrowed rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Poetic precision in metaphor (“lead apron around ribs,” “thermometers of remorse”) elevates the story. Emotional subtext is conveyed through gesture and silence rather than explicit emotion. Ending’s thematic payoff balances ambiguity and revelation effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rich thematic undercurrents prevent predictability, but some elements (e.g., self-acceptance) lean on familiar ideas. Sensory details are specific but occasionally verge on ornate. Twists on legacy and ritual feel fresh, though inconsistently emphasized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements interlock conceptually, but brevity leaves some underexplored. The story hinges on metaphorical cohesion rather than conventional structure; its strength lies in evoking lingering unease rather than narrative closure.</comment>
