<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks interiority, consistency, or distinct voice; motivations (salvaging libraries) are stated but not dramatized through specific choices or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>No discernible narrative arc; plot exists as a series of disconnected, abstract images with no momentum, resolution, or logical cause/effect relationship.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (lemon/salt smell, "acoustic blackness") create a haunting atmosphere, but the surreal setting prioritizes poetic tone over coherent worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (juggling as translation, tea leaves as cartographers) offers layered meaning; the ending suggests cultural continuity, though emotional impact remains intellectualized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors coexist with overwritten phrases ("oceans of waterlogged stacks"); the narrative veers between inventive leaps and vague poetic abstraction, occasionally feeling generative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><comment>Strong aesthetic unity and thematic ambition, but the story reads more as a mood piece than a fully realized narrative; the brief feels intentionally exploited rather than organically contained.</comment>
