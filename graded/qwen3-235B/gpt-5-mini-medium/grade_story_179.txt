<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's symbolic role is clear, but lacks emotional depth; motivation to combat envy is conceptually coherent but insufficiently grounded in human-like psychology; assigned traits (confidence, forced gentleness) shape actions but remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional progressionâ€”more vignette than narrative; assigned action (mobilizing cooperation) creates thematic unity but no clear arc; coherence maintained but momentum stymied by abstract repetition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly textured atmosphere through synesthetic details (honeyed light, humming combs); setting serves as both literal and metaphorical framework; enhances theme through evocative, consistent sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphor layering (fingerprints as maps of jealousy, combs as emotional barometers); subtext of societal control vs. individual longing resonates; ending balances closure and ambiguity; prose elevates conceptual resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction; metaphors feel fresh but occasionally over-extended; emotional nuance implied through symbolism rather than visceral character work; voice remains singular but risks didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully fuses assigned elements into poetic allegory, but sacrifices narrative urgency for aesthetic precision; brevity works conceptually but leaves thematic weight underexplored; lingering impact comes from metaphor, not emotional stakes.</comment>
