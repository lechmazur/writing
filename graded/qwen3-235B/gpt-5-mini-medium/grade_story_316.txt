<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's timidity and vow drive action but feels more archetypal than psychologically layered; motivation clear through symbolic acts but lacks interior conflict complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Scoreboard consults and quilt-stitching propel plot, but pacing falters under word limit; narrative arc resolved yet feels compressed, sacrificing nuanced progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie fusion of industrial decay and mythic imagery creates vivid atmosphere; sensory details (neon votives, smoke-dyed threads) immerse but occasionally overwhelm functional logic of setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose elevates theme of mending; subtext of communal resilience resonates; ending leans on poetic summation rather than earned emotional crescendo.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in blending myth and machinery motifs; some phrasing ("unapologetic timidity") risks aestheticizing trauma; emotional resonance implied rather than viscerally shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eccentric elements coalesce into thematic patchwork; ambitious in scope but uneven in execution, leaning on lyrical abstraction over narrative cohesion.</comment>
