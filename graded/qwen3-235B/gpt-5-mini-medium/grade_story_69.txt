<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character acts as metaphorical construct rather than dynamic entity; assigned traits emphasized conceptually over emotional depth, but motivations remain abstract with thin psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Meandering vignettes lack forward momentum; structural cohesion absent between shop/library/audition threads; "completeness" undermined by haphazard pacing and undefined stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ambient sensory details (ozone, greasepaint) create texture but worldbuilding contradicts itself (mechanical ferns + druidic rituals); tone shifts between weary and mystical without integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich but uneven metaphors (glitch-flowers, analog ghosts) dazzle while subtext about finding meaning in chaos remains under-realized; ending gestures at thematic closure too abruptly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unique fusion of fantasy/sci-fi tropes risks contrivance; lush descriptors strain credibility ("lullaby for analog ghosts"), though some choices (teacup timekeeping) show refreshing specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Compelling fragments coexist with structural and emotional gaps; atmospheric flourishes cannot fully compensate for diffuse narrative purpose or underdeveloped human stakes.</comment>
