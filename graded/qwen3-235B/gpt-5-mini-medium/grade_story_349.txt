<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's cynically hopeful duality is present but underexplored; motivations are poetic but lack psychological depth; interactions show transformation but inner conflict remains abstract</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Meandering structure finds focus in the herb-distribution climax; the dating event's absurdity drives thematic connection but sacrifices narrative momentum; resolution feels thematically consistent yet structurally strained</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visionary synthesis of technological and archaic elements through sensory-rich descriptions creates haunting atmosphere; every setting detail serves emotional or thematic resonance</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some overwritten metaphors border on pretension ("glass room" repetitions), but surreal originality and tonal consistency counterbalance; emotional nuance emerges through setting rather than character interiority</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Synthesis of disparate elements creates unique genre fusion; some worldbuilding dominates over character logic, but atmospheric cohesion and resonant themes compensate for occasional narrative fragmentation</comment>
