<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional specificity despite poetic abstractions; motivations are implied through metaphoric gestures but lack visceral psychological granularity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>No traditional plot progression; coherence derives from thematic repetition rather than narrative action, risking static disengagement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fetid waiting area and funhouse mirror create a haunted, post-historical limbo; sensory details immerse while thematically intersecting with the vigilante's fractured identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (bead's fingerprints, mirror's distortions) ache with philosophical weight; ending's "narrow clear music" crystallizes war's moral ambiguity through virtuosic poetic compression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in conceit but risks overwrought abstraction; some phrases ("slow arithmetic of the price of war") transcend clich√© through context, others strain toward profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragmentary cohesion achieved through obsessive imagery rather than narrative; succeeds as literary artifact but lacks urgent emotional propulsion for broader resonance.</comment>
