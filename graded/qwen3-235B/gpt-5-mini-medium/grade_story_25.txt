<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent but remain symbolic; motivations are clear but lack nuanced evolution. The diary externalizes internal struggle but does not develop him as a humanized figure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through thematic actions, but cause-effect is abstract rather than fully grounded. Pacing veers between lyrical reverie and abrupt shifts; cohesion suffers slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere and tactile details (e.g., "ultraviolet glow," "salt-stained coat") immerse readers, but setting often feels evocative background rather than a fully integrated narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolic resonances (ladders as choice, fire as rebellion) elevate the tale, though emotional payoff lacks visceral immediacy. The ending satisfies thematically but not viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original imagery (e.g., "species of light") is undercut by occasionally overwrought phrasing ("controlled unraveling in their chests"). The ladder-as-metaphor feels freshly conceived; broader tone occasionally leans on poetic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but unevenly synergize. The ultraviolet forest and theater framing create intrigue, but some components (ladder, diary) feel more integral than others.</comment>
