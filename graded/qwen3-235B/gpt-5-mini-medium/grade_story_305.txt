<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Reticence is shown through sparse action and physicality but lacks emotional depth; motivation is thematically clear but underdeveloped in character's choices; assigned attribute is present but doesn't drive decisions. No distinct narrative voice weakens psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Circular action of knocking/driving echoes lacks traditional plot momentum; the method's mechanics strain plausibility in physical terms; while atmospheric cohesion exists, structural progression feels amorphous; resolution through spectral debates reads more poetic than narratively satisfying within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Submerged opera house creates potent liminality between ruin and artistry; lanterns' distortions and water's resonances masterfully engage multiple senses; timelessness of decay meets active intervention; setting isn't just backdrop but interactive force shaping both character and concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (cake-making as antidote to inertia) operate with lyrical subtlety; theme of artistic responsibility lingers through symbol integration; conflicts are existential rather than externalized; subtext about legacy vs. stasis manifests beautifully in tableaux-like ending; dialogue absence mitigated by vivid gestural language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details avoid clich√© (metallic hymns, echoes as parliament) but verge on overload; metaphors like laughter-made-physical feel fresh though occasionally overwhelming; emotional register remains abstracted rather than visceral; structural looseness suggests deliberate stylization, not algorithmic drift; cake's domesticity contrasts effectively with spectral elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically even when plot remains ambiguous; brevity focuses attention on resonant images rather than conventional storytelling; symbolic layering invites interpretation without feeling contrived; some aspects (cousin's sketches) feel underexploited but don't disrupt overall unity.</comment>
