<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations feel abstract rather than rooted in recognizable human logic. Empirical traits clash with occult methods without meaningful tension. Reactions to objects/concepts remain symbolic rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Abstract actions (decoding light, trapping sound) lack causal logic. Pacing drifts between poetic imagery and inert moments. Ending feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned through narrative progression. Fragmented structure mimics poetic meditation more than coherent plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting evokes haunting beauty (tethered stars, floating space), but world-building remains decorative rather than functional. Sensory details like sea glass texture or silent resonance hint at atmosphere but fail to create immersive physicality. Tension between mechanical and mythic elements underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stylistic brilliance in blending scientific and mystical diction elevates the piece. Metaphors ("radiance on doubt's compost") create philosophical resonance. Subtext about creative perseverance beneath cosmic indifference lingers, though emotional impact diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elevates beyond formulaic sci-fi through surreal juxtapositions (microfilm/seaglass) and fresh metaphoric logic. Avoids overused tropes while maintaining internal consistency. Some overwritten phrases ("narrow sunbeam through a porthole") verge on cliché but are exceptions. Voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Loose cohesion binds elements—floating observatory and sea glass provide aesthetic scaffolding, but their narrative necessity remains questionable. Story feels constructed around assigned elements rather than organically unfolding from them. Lingering questions about meaning lack payoff.</comment>
