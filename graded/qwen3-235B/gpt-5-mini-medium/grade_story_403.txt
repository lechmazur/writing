<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation and 'hope-worn' trait are clear but remain more symbolic than deeply internalized; his conflict is hinted but not fully dramatized beyond abstract reflections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Weak narrative arc; the story is atmospheric but struggles to establish a clear middle or progression. Pacing is inconsistent in its limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive sensory details (rocking library, shell's pulse) ground the surreal setting, though the 'floating' aspect feels underexplored beyond poetic metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and imagery enrich the surface, but the theme of 'perception's limits' leans on abstract statements rather than concrete emotional/subtextual execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Language risks becoming self-indulgent ('kindness first, observation second, imagination mandatory'), with some phrases evoking AI-adjacent ornateness over human nuance.</comment>
