<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Fragmentary structure lacks clear narrative arc; abstract progression fails to create satisfying beginning/middle/end; cause-effect relationships are diffused; timeframe manipulation feels decorative rather than structural; no cohesive tension or resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere via specific details (jaundiced light, clinking vials) but tenuous connection between setting and narrative function; worldbuilding is impressionistic rather than integral to character's journey; sensory details are vivid but serve style over substance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stylish but self-conscious prose with memorable metaphors ("measuring tears with a bent ruler") and rich imagery; lacks emotional heft despite literary flourishes; theme of defiant compassion introduced but underdeveloped; shows more than tells but struggles with meaningful subtext.</comment>
