<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaknesses in explicit backstory and underdeveloped internal consistency of 'carefully reckless' trait; strengths in symbolic gestures (amber confession) revealing character depth without exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meandering progression with underdeveloped cause-effect; atmospheric momentum compensates for loose structural scaffolding in compressed form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, singular atmosphere marries setting to theme through concrete sensory textures; cathedral's metamorphosis from ruin to vibrant space is conceptually vital.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original interplay of military and artistic elements avoids genre tropes; some descriptions verge on poetic excess but maintain stylistic individuality; emotional subtext emerges through oblique gesture rather than direct declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematic unity; stylistic brevity serves introspective arc; lingering questions outweigh explicit revelations; ambitious but not flawless.</comment>
