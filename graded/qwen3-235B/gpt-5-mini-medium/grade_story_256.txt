<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character has visual/behavioral coherence but motivation remains abstract and undefined. The "kindly guard" embodies poetic gestures without psychological grounding, making loyalty/disloyalty feel decorative rather than thematically necessary.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; episodic imagery replaces narrative momentum. The midnight timeframe creates structural cohesion but fails to produce meaningful stakes or resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s backbone: ethereal grocery store setting, midnight sensory details, and surreal geography create immersive, emotionally resonant worldbuilding through precise, original metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistically daring with potent literary devices (metaphor sequences, symbolic objects) that evoke wistful yearning. The ending synthesizes theme/imagery effectively, though overt "tasting a promise" gesture risks over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality radiates in blending mundane supermarket elements with metaphysical longing. Avoids predictable emotional beats, favoring textural strangeness that resists clichés despite occasionally mannered phrasing ("seize the horizon").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Elements coalesce thematically but sacrifice narrative dynamism. The poetic style works as deliberate artistic choice, though brevity leaves thematic weight underexplored, weakening lasting impact.</comment>
