<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks emotional nuance; actions align with stated goals but feel abstract rather than lived. "Merchant" background has minimal impact on decision-making processes. Aloof passion remains more descriptive than demonstrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot advances through conceptual gestures rather than concrete developments; ascending via poster edges lacks narrative weight. Pacing maintains steady momentum but resolution remains purely ideological rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through juxtaposition of organic decay and sterile technology; sensory details like flaking paper and starlight refractions effectively ground abstraction. Spatial logic occasionally muddled between visceral imagery and metaphysical implications.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Layered symbolism (butter churn as cultural artifact, poster as decaying memory) creates rich subtext. While dialogue absent, thematic cohesion between environmental collapse and information control sustains intellectual engagement. Ending resonates as thematic culmination rather than narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional rebellion mechanics. Metaphorical choices (butter churn as anti-tech symbol, ascending via disintegration) feel freshly conceived. Language occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction but maintains purposeful construction rather than algorithmic filler.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but narrative payoff leans heavily on conceptual satisfaction. Stylistic precision elevates execution, though brevity prevents full emotional realization. Lingering resonance emerges from provocative juxtaposition of obsolete objects and digital surveillance.</comment>
