<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid but lacks interiority; traits exist as poetic descriptors rather than psychological motivations. Actions lack emotional stakes or personal consequences.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows mystical logic rather than narrative causality; the transformation of prophecy lacks tangible stakes or consequences within the story's confined scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting exists as atmospheric backdrop rather than lived-in world; "ancient Chinese palace" elements are superficially decorative rather than culturally specific or functionally integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality evident in concept pairing but undermined by over-reliance on esoteric abstraction; some lush descriptions border on purple prose while failing to fully ground metaphysical elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Story succeeds as poetic mood piece but lacks dramatic tension or philosophical depth; assigned elements are cleverly deployed but narrative remains conceptually hermetic.</comment>
