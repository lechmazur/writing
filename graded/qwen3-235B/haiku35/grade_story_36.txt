<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but overly abstract; symbolic representation dominates over human complexity. Assigned attribute "calm doomsayer" shapes tone but lacks visceral behavioral grounding. The skateboard reveals backstory but feels more like metaphor than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward motion; exists as a static tableau of ideas. Assigned action "resume" anchors vague backstory but fails to drive progression. Beginning and end mirror each other without meaningful development. Cause-effect relationships implied but never dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and barn loft coexist uneasily, undermining atmospheric cohesion. Sensory details (whistle, sunlight) work but feel disconnected from setting. Distant train sound isn't meaningfully connected to workshop machinery. Timeframe provides mood but little narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (peeling stickers as old skin, skateboard/weapon dichotomy) elevated by lyrical prose. However, excessive telling rather than showing dilutes impact. Theme of radical renewal emerges clearly but remains intellectualized. Ending lacks emotional or narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dense with clich√©d binaries (calm/ferocity, stagnation/rebirth). Overly ornate descriptions ("mechanical breathing of gears") verge on parody. Metaphors recycled from counterculture tropes lack originality. Paragraphs exhibit AI-like cadence with repetitive sentence structures and forced symbolic connections.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements functionally assembled but lack organic unity. The concept-driven approach prioritizes abstraction over emotional resonance. Story's brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful. Lingering impression is of aestheticized rebellion without tangible stakes or fresh perspective.</comment>
