<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation feels abstracted rather than embodied; loyalty exists conceptually without substantial demonstration. Actions (coded comedy) lack psychological grounding in the scout identity. The "voice" relies heavily on exposition over lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a performative structure but lacks causal progression - nothing escalates or transforms meaningfully despite the word limit. The beginning and end mirror each other without resolution or revelation, making the arc feel static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting relies on evocative terms like "sanctified dread" and "moth observation tower" that sound impressive but lack sensory specificity. The flickering lights create atmosphere but aren't integral to the story's mechanics or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts thematic depth about subtle revolution but fails to evoke visceral engagement. Literary devices (moth symbolism, comedy-as-code) remain surface concepts rather than immersive experiences. Conflict between tradition and transformation feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Feels assembled from archetypal elements (revolutionary journals, power outages) with formulaic transitions. Over-reliance on vague but weighty terms ("sanctified dread," "radicalization through comedy") reads like generative filler rather than specific invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>ELEMENTS FEEL CHECKLIST-BASED rather than organically integrated. The brief format reveals skeletal plotting rather than intentional constraint. Ending aims for philosophical weight but lands as superficially profound rather than intellectually generative.</comment>
