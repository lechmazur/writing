<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character is paradoxically defined by contradictions, with motivation clearly tied to escaping perception's limits. However, internal conflict isn't dramatized through concrete actions, limiting developmental impact.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Circular structure effectively frames transformation within constrained space/time, but the epiphany feels abrupt rather than earned through progressive tension or narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully merges ethereal and tactile details (e.g., "whispered manuscripts," "calloused fingers"), creating a liminal space where abstract ideas become palpable through sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose balances philosophical inquiry with visceral imagery; subtext about perception's malleability resonates through symbolic objects, though some metaphors risk over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digressive lyricism occasionally veers into self-indulgence, but innovative metaphors (miracles as "subtle rearrangements of possibility") and psychological nuance maintain literary distinction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified thematic whole, with the knight's perceptual transformation serving as both plot and existential metaphor, though tighter dramatic construction could elevate it further.</comment>
