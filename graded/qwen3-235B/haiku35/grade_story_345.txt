<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character's motivation (defiance against fate) is consistent with his background as lapsed priest, but lacks dynamic development beyond philosophical introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abstract journey lacks narrative urgency; snow patterns as a plot driver are conceptually strong but structurally underdeveloped. Some coherence issues due to surreal shifts.</comment>
