<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (rebellion against corruption) is clear and consistent, but emotional layers remain underdeveloped. The photograph as a physicalized memory is effective, though "serine anger" contradicts the tense bodyguard description. Reactions to objects (photo, greenhouse) reveal inner conflict but lack nuanced complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has coherence through rebellion arc but strains under word limit. Park visits as intelligence-gathering lack connection to lunar setting. Pacing rushed during quarterly review climax; cause-effect logic between fragment collection and resolution feels simplified. The "timely rebirth" concept shapes the ending but lacks full integration with earlier tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lunar greenhouse's visual contrast (Earth's blue vs. monochrome landscape) and hydroponic biological rhythms create strong sensory immersion. "Serene" tone juxtaposes effectively with underlying rebellion. Park visits reference feels disconnected from moon atmosphere, weakening temporal cohesion. Metaphor of constrained growth aligns well with theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plant survival metaphors and rebellion subtext show thematic depth, but emotional impact diluted by exposition. "Serene anger" concept has potential but becomes stated rather than dramatized. Ending achieves thematic resonance with "new chapter" gardening metaphor. Conflict remains intellectualized - physical sensations of rebellion insufficiently 'shown'.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh lunar botany angle, but contains predictable rebellion tropes. "Botanist vs. evil consortium" setup borders on clich√©. The photograph device avoids overused imagery through specific physical details (worn edges). Some overwritten phrases ("delicate dance of survival") verge on purple prose. Nuanced motivation elevates above formula.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into coherent whole despite ambitious scope - the lunar setting and rebellion mechanics support each other. Story effectively uses brevity to create urgency rather than limitation. Park visits framing device weakens cohesion. Ending provokes reflection on liberation through biological adaptation but lacks visceral punch. Demonstrates creative synthesis but uneven execution.</comment>
