<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's controlled exterior is shown, but motivations (preserving techniques, regret) lack depth. Internal logic between rebellious core and actions remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has rising tension but lacks resolution. Offloading mission drives action, yet the 500-word limit exposes rushed pacing and an arc truncated before payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</comment><grade>Atmosphere is richly detailed but inconsistently integrated. Carnival decay creates mood, but tone clashes with tech-heavy elements, diluting cohesion.</grade>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Uses effective imagery ("mechanical ghosts") but relies on surface-level themes. Subtext like the unsent letter hints at depth but isn't emotionally realized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (quantum tech, abandoned spaces). Descriptions like "tracking threads" feel derivative. Lacks fresh subversion of clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but forced. Style leans on ornate prose over clarity. Short length highlights gaps rather than enhancing impact.</comment>
