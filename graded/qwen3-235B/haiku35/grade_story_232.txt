<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lack of nuanced character development undermines motivation; profession mismatch (physician vs. archaeologist) confuses traits. "Quietly dramatic" attribute feels superficial, while supernatural perception emerges abruptly without gradual characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing bogs down in atmospheric excess before rushed revelations; no clear arc despite tight word limit. Cause-effect logic weakens when coffee grounds directly "speak" - plot hinges on mystical convenience rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative details like LED shadows and satellite hums create hybrid mystique, but tone fractures under "dire enchantment" - technological/ancient contrasts lack psychological grounding for the supernatural elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Geometric pattern imagery mesmerizes initially, but themes remain surface-level; ending with "silent dance of revelation" feels like evasion rather than catharsis. Metaphors (artifacts watching) lack payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Clich√© AI giveaways abound: "pulse with energy," "whispers from forgotten worlds," and repetitive "edge of horizon" framing. Attempts at subversion (coffee grounds as decoding method) feel forced rather than inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements function mechanically rather than organically - digital camp's significance dissolves under scrutiny. Lingering questions about "dire enchantment" lack purposeful ambiguity; overall impression remains one of unfinished conceptual scaffolding.</comment>
