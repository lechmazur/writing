<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Exposition-heavy character moments undercut otherwise compelling philosophical depth; transformation feels narratively convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure sacrifices coherence for poeticism; certain plot connections (confetti to labyrinth) remain superficially linked despite ambitious conceptual goals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but conceptually underutilized setting elements; labyrinth's breathing walls and lanterns suggest deeper symbolic systems never fully articulated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (kaleidoscope as epistemological tool) elevate narrative but are undermined by pat resolution that simplifies rather than explores paradoxes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by familiar redemption arc; sensory details occasionally verge on overwritten but mostly avoid AI-generated redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Competent execution of high-concept framework lacks the transcendent punch required for elite publication; too many elements feel conceptually adjacent rather than organically fused.</comment>
