<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (making amends), and curiosity drives actions, but emotional depth lacks nuance; dialogue feels slightly mechanical despite consistent alignment with traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic arc but feels truncated; cause-effect logic holds, though pacing stumbles under word constraints and resolution feels rushed without sufficient emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting merges metaphor and technical detail beautifully; the nano-city’s sensory vividness and symbolic connections to emotional states elevate the atmosphere significantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths lie in poetic metaphors and thematic cohesion, but emotional resonance relies too heavily on stated feelings (e.g., “persistent hope”) rather than layered subtext or surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by blending sci-fi with intimate drama; metaphors feel fresh, though occasional tech jargon (“quantum threads”) risks overfamiliarity. Overall style is controlled but not visionary.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All elements contribute to theme without feeling forced; concise format amplifies tension between emotional and scientific reconciliation, though some aspects (e.g., Marcus’s arc) remain underexplored.</comment>
