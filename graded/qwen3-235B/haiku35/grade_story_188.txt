<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character defined by surface traits (haunted eyes, lawman past) but lacks psychological depth; motivation exists but feels more like abstract thematic anchor than human-driven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements mechanically assembled without apparent narrative necessity; style prioritizes ornamental description over urgent storytelling; conceptual themes outweigh character-driven momentum.</comment>
