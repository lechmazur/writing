<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Main character’s motivation is abstract rather than viscerally embodied; emotional stakes remain generalized despite thematic resonance. Marcus functions as a plot device rather than a fully realized counterpoint.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single unchanging action (the broadcast) with minimal narrative complication; structural symmetry between beginning and end feels predetermined rather than earned through dynamic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive—living shadows, celestial grotto, and spectral figures create haunting sensory textures that amplify thematic concerns through richly layered imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (chessboard as erased narratives) are conceptually resonant but occasionally heavy-handed; subtextual depth is undercut by exposition-heavy dialogue that explains rather than integrates ideas.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perspective and metaphors avoid genre clichés but occasionally border on didactic; emotional resonance emerges through symbolic gestures rather than nuanced character psychology or subversive narrative risks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under the weight of their symbolic burden; the brevity feels like a structural constraint rather than an organic narrative choice.</comment>
