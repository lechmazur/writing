<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Main character's warrior aspect underutilized; zealous obsession with relics shown but lacking personal stakes, backstories, or meaningful flaws. Motivation explained more than demonstrated through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Static contemplation dominates; no discernible narrative arc within constraints. Time capsule revelations don't translate to concrete plot momentum, leaving story feeling suspended without progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere established through cosmic descriptions and oppressive historical context. Sensory details inconsistent - visual descriptions strong, but other senses neglected. Worldbuilding hinted at without full realization.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphors about history and revolution undercut by lack of emotional grounding. Open-ended conclusion lacks payoff; central conflict remains abstract rather than tangible. Poetic language present without sufficient narrative heft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Recycles sci-fi revolutionary tropes without subversion. Descriptive passages sometimes descend into ornate abstractions. Emotional resonance remains conceptual rather than visceral. Style occasionally overwhelms substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively on concept level but lack narrative depth. Short form constrains impact rather than enhances it. Central ideas about historical truth have lingering power, but execution feels incomplete.</comment>
