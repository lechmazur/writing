<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's theatrical persona is distinct and influences actions, but motivations lack depth. Emotional stakes remain abstract despite surface-level justification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed. The riddle sequence is logical yet lacks necessary buildup. Resolution satisfies the immediate quest but has minimal aftertaste.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting contains vivid visual elements (translucent architecture, trembling foundations) but sensory details lack integration with action. Atmospheric tone inconsistently maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story employs effective metaphors but relies heavily on expositional declarations rather than showing. The thematic link between performance and cosmic manipulation is conceptually stimulating yet emotionally detached.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most AI writing signs but contains moments of overripe description ("linguistic ballet") and occasionally predictable archetypes. Combines surreal elements with genre conventions in moderately innovative fashion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Variably successful integration of assigned elements. While concepts connect logically, emotional weight and narrative cohesion suffer from word constraints. Ambitious but insufficiently realized for top-tier standards.</comment>
