<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict; Elena's alien identity shapes actions but "righteously flawed" trait feels underexplored and simplistic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a coherent arc but pacing feels hurried; the concert timeframe and organ's influence lack sufficient integration to create satisfying narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative through organ imagery and tile descriptions, but the Roman bathhouse setting remains underdeveloped, weakening temporal connections between past and present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (organ as historical bridge) and subtext about dormant human potential, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition and underdeveloped character interiors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids major AI clich√©s but relies on predictable sci-fi tropes (aliens preserving history, chosen child); some purple prose in atmospheric descriptions and overly precise sensory details that feel calculated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but unevenly executed; elements like the organ's method and bathhouse origins feel tacked on rather than purposefully woven into a unified whole.</comment>
