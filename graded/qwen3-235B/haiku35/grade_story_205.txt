<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Purely descriptive with no character voice; traits assigned through labeling rather than behavior. No internal conflict or transformation despite stated motivations. Cynicism never manifests through action or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Meandering vignette structure lacks forward motion; the promised "moment of revelation" never materializes. No discernible plot progression between paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fireflies and swamp atmosphere create visual texture, but sensory engagement remains cerebral rather than visceral. Swamps should smell like rot and promise death—this one indulges abstract "knowing".</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors operate at textbook proficiency, but emotional impact is muted by excessive abstraction. The ending's revolutionary promise feels unearned through lack of narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Verbal embroidery compensates for hollow core—phrases like "peaceful frenzy" and "living canvas" ring hollow. Reliance on clichéd warrior tropes undercut claims of originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present like checklist items rather than organic components. Excessive thematic overlay obscures narrative clarity; would require complete restructuring for market viability.</comment>
