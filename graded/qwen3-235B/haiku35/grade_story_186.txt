<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara’s whimsical nature is stated but underexplored in actions; her mortality-driven motivation feels abstract rather than embodied through concrete conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>No clear narrative arc—static focus on creation without stakes; the method of sculpting fortune-tellers drives the plot but lacks cause-effect momentum or satisfying resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid, mist-laden stalactites and mechanical workshop create mood, but the suspended palace’s creaks feel symbolic rather than integral to character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Environmental metaphor through brass workings is inventive, but the ending’s thematic declaration (“testament to humanity’s potential”) undercuts subtler mechanical allegories.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on ornate descriptors (“stone fingers,” “delicate painted expressions”) and eco-apocalyptic tropes dulls the otherwise original premise of mechanical prophets.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Solid cohesion but lacks urgency; elements like the thermometer and palace blend tone and concept but fail to elevate beyond a thematic essay dressed as fiction.</comment>
