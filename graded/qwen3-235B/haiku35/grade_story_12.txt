<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and motivation exist superficially but lack psychological depth; reactions to the tile hint at emotional complexity but remain abstract, never coalescing into a fully realized persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot drifts without concrete action or progression; the static mall setting and internal monologue create cohesion issues, leaving the narrative feeling like disconnected vignettes rather than a structured arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Futuristic mall contains vivid sensory details, but the hi-tech atmosphere remains decorative rather than integral—never meaningfully intersecting with Elena's internal world or advancing thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors connecting memory to cartography offer intellectual intrigue, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction; ending lacks cathartic resolution despite ambitious thematic scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overly ornate prose ("eager resignation," "cartography of the soul") frequently veers into purple territory; reliance on melancholic tropes and fragmented structure feels like affectation rather than authentic innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outweighs execution; assigned elements function more as checklist items than organic components—narrative remains self-consciously literary without achieving transcendent cohesion.</comment>
