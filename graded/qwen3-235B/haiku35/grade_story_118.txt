<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters feel schematic, serving atmospheric and thematic goals over depth. Elena's "primary motivation" is stated but not dramatized; Marcus's trauma lacks emotional specificity despite vivid imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as fragmented vignettes rather than structured progression. Excessive thematic abstraction undermines narrative momentum; the "eve of a bold discovery" setup remains unrealized and disconnected from the unresolved emotional revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely realized through precise sensory details (pulsing charger plug, candle wax landscapes) and paradoxical tonal contrasts. The sterile training facility's role in absorbing "merry bitterness" creates haunting environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (wax as memory, anchors vs ephemera) elevates the prose. However, emotional impact feels intellectualized rather than viscerally conveyed. The "disclosure that would change everything—and nothing" embodies the story's tension between profundity and ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original conceptual framework (hive-mind psychology, wax-encoded trauma) is compelling. Avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into poetic abstraction that risks vagueness. Some phrases ("slow drip of candle wax") border on mannerism rather than innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere stylistically but narratively feel like atmosphere-draped fragments rather than a unified work. The brevity serves thematic condensation but sacrifices character and plot resolution necessary for lasting impact beyond initial intrigue.</comment>
