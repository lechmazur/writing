<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks depth; traits like "secretive" are stated but not meaningfully demonstrated. Emotional shifts (e.g., sudden kiss) feel unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies heavily on abrupt transitions ("life-changing kiss") and compressed logic. Cause-effect relationships (e.g., how doodles lead to discovery) are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory immersion in setting details (mustiness of books, bird calls) creates mood, but connections between sanctuary and tech themes feel superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (birds as restoration) and subtext about knowledge resurrection elevate impact, but emotional beats (kiss revelation) strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©s (secret genius, ancient diagrams as magic) and awkwardly formal phrasing ("undying creativity pulsed through these pages"). Overused "sanctuary as hidden workshop" trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than integrate; tight word limit strains narrative cohesion. Lingering questions about character psychology or thematic implications are shallow.</comment>
