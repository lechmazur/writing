<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation ("liberation through understanding") is clear but underexplored, with psychological depth sacrificed to allegorical function. Reyes' "elegant clumsiness" remains surface trait without revealing character interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable ghost-story arc with forced convergence of elements. Cause-effect between elevator repairs and narrative resolution stretched credulity despite word constraints; structural symmetry feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Setting relies on atmospheric clichés (whispering machinery, sterile labs) without establishing authentic spatial logic. The sand castle preservation concept lacks technical specificity to ground its historical importance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphoric use of elevator mechanics as narrative device shows ingenuity. Ending achieves thematic resonance through object transformation (flower crown) but emotional impact remains muted by didactic exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clichés but falls into patterned contrasts (mechanical/spiritual, silence/resonance). Sensory descriptions verge on formulaic ("peculiar silence that vibrated") without creating unique phenomenological experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Element integration displays competent craftsmanship rather than daring cohesion. Technical precision in execution outpaces thematic innovation; feels written to assignment specifications rather than from urgent creative impulse.</comment>
