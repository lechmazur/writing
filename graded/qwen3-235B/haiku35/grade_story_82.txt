<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete reluctance despite assignment, but motivation to decode mysteries is consistent. Analytical-playful duality is implied through narrative contrast but underdeveloped. The dragon tooth's significance reveals curiosity but doesn't fully showcase core traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>No discernible narrative arc within constraints - story functions as mood piece rather than structurally coherent plot. Atmospheric progression replaces dramatic momentum. Assigned action/method connections remain abstract rather than driving concrete plot developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually evocative fusion of techno-agricultural elements with mystical elements works atmospherically. Sensory details (luminescent tooth, breathing orchard) create immersive liminality. Modern/futuristic elements sometimes superficially applied rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creatively juxtaposes scientific rigor with poetic speculation through stylistic oscillations. Lyrical prose creates haunting atmosphere without emotional payoff. Central theme of decoding hidden histories remains abstract despite textual richness. Memorable imagery outweighs narrative substance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unusual combinations but occasionally succumbs to ornate description ("fossilized dragon tooth's impossible luminescence"). Subtly subverts AI tendencies through specific botanical anomalies but maintains somewhat formulaic mystical revelation patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic architecture rather than narrative skeleton. Ambiguous cohesion between technological and mystical dimensions creates thematic resonance without narrative conviction. Strong atmospheric unity but lacks urgent, unifying dramatic principle.</comment>
