<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are obscured by excessive atmosphere; spineless mercenary trait contradicted by sudden resolve without emotional groundwork, rendering actions disconnected from established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under the weight of its own abstraction; beginning/end linkage artificial, pacing suffocated by verbose descriptions over forward momentum or consequential stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere meticulously crafted with sensory overload, yet setting functions more as aesthetic wallpaper than narrative engine—its potential to shape character or conflict remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elegant prose fails to compensate for shallow thematic engagement; symbolism operates at surface level, and ending’s tremulous 'potential' feels artificial rather than earned through narrative investment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overabundance of ornate abstraction borders on self-parody; repetitive 'shadow'/geometry motifs, unnatural philosophical declarations, and inconsistent emotional stakes scream workshop-avoidance tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High-concept promise collapses under its own density—elements function as intellectual scaffolding rather than narrative flesh, leaving little oxygen for reader engagement or thematic resonance.</comment>
