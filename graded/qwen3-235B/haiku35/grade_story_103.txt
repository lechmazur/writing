<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lack of depth in motivation beyond vague regret; prisoner's characterization remains superficial despite key role. Dialogue feels symbolic but lacks authentic emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coherent existential dilemma compressed into tight word count, but tension resolution feels abrupt. Pacing hesitates between introspection and action without clear narrative propulsion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral maritime atmosphere through kinetic descriptions of sea/light/reflections creates immersive psychological landscape that meaningfully reflects internal states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical framework (mirrors/beacon/reef) with resonant final line, but emotional impact diluted by exposition-heavy interiority rather than embodied consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Attempts lyrical prose but slips into clich√©d symbolism ("razor's edge of revelation"). Subtle emotional contradictions undercut by overly programmatic atmospheric brooding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole despite uneven execution. Abstract conceptual scaffolding prevents full immersion in character truth.</comment>
