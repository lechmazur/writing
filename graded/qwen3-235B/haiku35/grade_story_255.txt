<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (analytically innovative, innocent cynicism) are described but not demonstrated through specific actions; motivation framed as abstract philosophy rather than embodied psychology; reactions to USB drive overly intellectualized without visceral human dimension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal momentum - decoding process summarized rather than dramatized; connections between timeframe (post-party silence) and action remain symbolic rather than functional; climax feels like philosophical declaration instead of earned narrative resolution; pacing emphasizes lyrical description over plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere rich in tactile details (petrichor, skeletal creaks) that connect to themes, but setting functions more as gothic tableau than active environmental force; decaying tower symbolic but spatial logic inconsistent; rain's narrative purpose remains ambient rather than mechanistic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (DNA of silence, cartography of manipulation) but occasionally ventures into purple prose; ending attempts thematic resonance yet feels abrupt; emotional impact undercut by over-reliance on abstractions like "pure truth"; sophisticated subtext about institutional memory but underwhelming character specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mix of original (mythic relic as information) and clich√©d elements (labyrinth mind, skeleton metaphors); overly ornate language occasionally obscures narrative clarity; emotional nuance conveyed through concepts rather than tangible moments; consistent tone but repetitive phrase structures suggest algorithmic default patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion masks structural looseness - assigned elements present but unevenly integrated; themes echo rather than amplify each other; ambitious ideas constrained by compressed format that prioritizes mood over development; provocative but not fully realized.</comment>
