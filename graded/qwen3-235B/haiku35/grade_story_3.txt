<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (cosmic patterns) is consistent with actions, but "surly" aspect lacks behavioral demonstration; voice remains distinct but underexplored through dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end structure within word limit, but pacing feels slightly compressed; riddle drives plot, though connection between cosmic patterns and resolution remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid liminal atmosphere through sensory details (wind, snow, yarn textures), but settingâ€™s connection to cosmic themes feels underdeveloped beyond superficial alignment metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (yarn as interconnectedness) resonate; ending prompt reflection on mystery, but emotional impact diluted by abstract, occasionally detached prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some overuse of abstract descriptors ("dignified chaos") and occasionally ornate phrasing; avoids major tropes but struggles to subvert "mysterious watchman" archetypes fully.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but unevenly integrated; brevity serves theme but sacrifices deeper exploration of character and cosmic concepts.</comment>
