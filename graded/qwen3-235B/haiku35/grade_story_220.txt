<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (obsessive truth-seeking, family mystery) are clear but underdeveloped; Elena's aloofness feels superficial rather than shaping her interactions; reactions lack psychological nuance despite high-stakes discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has linear progression but feels compressed; the delay-driving-event mechanic works logically but lacks narrative urgency; the encounter and revelation arrive with minimal buildup, diluting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Shipping containers create visual potency and claustrophobic atmosphere; "wounded season" establishes mood but with generic autumnal decay tropes; sensory details (rust, shadows) effective but insufficiently textured for full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Imagery (whispering containers, pulsing envelope) creates mild intrigue but lacks poetic intensity; theme of obscured histories resonates, though resolution feels abrupt; subtext about narrative control exists but remains undercooked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains semi-generic descriptors ("weathered man", "industrial labyrinth"); metaphors verge on overused yet maintain freshness through specific maritime grounding; tension between archival obsession and action remains compellingly human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesion struggles under the weight of assigned elements; the "wounded season" and "aloof page" feel tacked on rather than integrated; writing shows ambition but uneven execution in balancing atmospheric demands against narrative progression.</comment>
