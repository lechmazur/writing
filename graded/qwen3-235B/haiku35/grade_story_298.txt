<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (weaving emotional honesty into illusions) aligns with actions and transformations, but inner conflicts lack depth. Rationally impulsive trait feels underexplored beyond vague descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves completeness through performance arc, but pacing feels rushed - key historical/cold-case elements lack development despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Post-oil palace atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though futuristic elements could integrate more with actual setting mechanics rather than just aesthetic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Craft shows strong symbolic use of skin transformation as narrative device, but emotional impact diluted by overly abstract descriptions rather than concrete sensory embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls with unique premise, but contains occasional overworked phrases ("anxious serenity") and underdeveloped paradoxical traits that feel conceptually neat rather than psychologically real.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack narrative urgency - futuristic context and historical mystery feel juxtaposed rather than interdependent. Some elements (cold-case methodology) remain underexploited.</comment>
