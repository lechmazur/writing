<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract concept; lacks emotional depth, personal history, or concrete behaviors to embody the restless wayfarer archetype. Motivation stated but not dramatized through specific choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot exists more as static tone poem than dynamic narrative. Tension between stillness/action never fully realized. Thin narrative arc struggles within word constraints despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting achieves visceral, synesthetic immersion through fractured mosaics and oppressive silence. Atmospheric details meticulously constructed but occasionally overwhelm narrative progression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphysical abstractions create intellectual engagement, but emotional resonance remains distant. Strong symbolic framework and thematic cohesion elevate impact despite limited character identification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with esoteric concepts, but occasionally lapses into ornamental abstraction. Sensory details specific but risk becoming elaborate scaffolding without human emotional center.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere stylistically but lack narrative urgency. Theoretical framework dominates over story, producing contemplative mood over lasting resonance. Effective brevity compromised by underdeveloped philosophical ambitions.</comment>
