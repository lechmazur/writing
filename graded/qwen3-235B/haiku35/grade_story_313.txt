<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are vaguely sketched rather than deeply explored; the central tension between remorse and rebellion lacks psychological complexity, reducing Marcus to a philosophical archetype rather than a fully realized individual.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but predictable within tight constraints; the action's execution through antiquated equipment and ghostly apparitions creates surface intrigue, but emotional payoff remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "mechanical desolation" and "translucent forms flickering against harsh industrial lighting" establish visceral environmental dread that effectively mirrors character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of the tape dispenser and effective "showing" of institutional oppression; lacks deeper subtext beyond surface anti-authoritarian themes; ending feels more performative than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Formulaic dystopian tropes (haunting, rebellion) lack fresh subversions; overly ornate descriptors ("spectral conspiracy of understanding") often substitute for genuine emotional nuance or inventive plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesion exists at surface level but lacks thematic profundity; the brief length emphasizes conceptual scaffolding over narrative depth; atmospheric strength partially compensates for thin character arcs.</comment>
