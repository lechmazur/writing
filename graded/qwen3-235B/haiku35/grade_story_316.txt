<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's timidity feels underexplored despite bold artistic vision; the juxtaposition of "seraphic" grace with "timid nature" lacks nuanced psychological depth</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compressed timeline; critical transitions (e.g., discovery of scoreboard, execution of installation) feel underdeveloped; resolution appears sudden rather than earned</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from evocative temple setting and decay imagery, but sensory details (sunlight filtering columns) remain generic rather than visceral; setting-character connections could be more organic</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of textile-as-memory metaphor and thematic subtext about communal healing; emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition over showing; ending lacks narrative surprise</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing but contains occasionally ornate prose ("scattered harmony that defied individual pain"); some forced symbolism (typewriter ribbon, scoreboard) feels more thematic scaffolding than organic</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as lyrical concept but struggles with execution within constraints; thematic cohesion partially undermines by uneven integration of assigned elements; stylistic ambition partially compensates for narrative brevity limitations</comment>
