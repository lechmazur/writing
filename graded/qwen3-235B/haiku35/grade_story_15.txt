<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character portrayal leans on symbolic weight over psychological depth; motivation to defy gods is clear but reactions occasionally feel plot-driven rather than organic. Nuanced grief is present but underexplored beneath lyrical surfaces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Postcard-driven plot progresses logically but relies heavily on narrative shortcuts (e.g., "Something shifted" resolution); connections between cryptic instructions and ritual mechanics remain abstract, weakening cause-effect clarity within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fog and decay create mood but sensory details are unevenly distributed; forge's symbolic resonance overshadows environmental specificity. Ruined orchard's connection to central themes remains suggestive rather than fully integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elegant prose elevates ritualistic defiance, but emotional impact leans on metaphor density ("tethered hope") rather than earned human experience; ending's cosmic implications contrast with underdeveloped personal stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Postcards-as-ritual-manual subverts mourning tropes inventively; atmospheric flourishes occasionally verge on clich√© but precise object choices (horseshoe, meteorite) demonstrate thoughtfulness. Character psychology could be less archetypal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole despite word limit; brevity serves mystical ambiguity. The forge/postcard/gods triad drives cohesion while foggy liminality and unanswered questions provide lingering resonance.</comment>
