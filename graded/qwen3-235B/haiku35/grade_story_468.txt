<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to "scientific rebellion" lack depth; traits are present but underexplored, with minimal emotional complexity or evolution despite narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coherent progression toward revelation, but pacing feels slightly inflated; abrupt shifts in stakes (e.g., sudden "cosmic" revelation) lack narrative groundwork within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., "mangrove shadows," "golden embers") create immersive atmosphere, but some descriptions verge on over-written without deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic footprints offer layered meaning, but emotional engagement remains distant; ending resonates conceptually more than viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (dream journals as "texts") and familiar tropes ("singing spirits"); occasional over-reliance on abstract phrasing weakens narrative cohesion and feels AI-influenced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic integration; brevity highlights underdeveloped arcs, though the premise hints at deeper, unexplored implications.</comment>
