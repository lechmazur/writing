<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is philosophically rich but lacks emotional depth; the mechanical arm ties to her work but the "coded desperation" isn't fully embodied through actions or consistent reactions. The sock remains a cryptic symbol rather than a revelation-enabling object.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abstract buildup culminates in a conceptual climax, but the plot’s momentum is slowed by dense philosophical exposition. The "shifting equilibria" concept shapes the narrative arc unevenly; pacing prioritizes poetic abstraction over cause-effect clarity within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is compellingly Gothic and cerebral, with evocative details (rusted nail, mechanical whirr) anchoring the abstract themes. The abandoned lighthouse’s decay contrasts effectively with technological precision, though timeframe specificity during the applause moment feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of consciousness malleability are intellectually provocative, and metaphors like "threads of a dream" add poetic resonance. However, the ending feels more like a declamation than a visceral revelation, relying heavily on conceptual "telling" over immersive "showing" of character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sock’s surreal juxtaposition offers originality, but other elements (mechanical arm revealing consciousness) border on cyberpunk clichés without subversion. Some phrases ("cathedral of potential") verge on purple prose; the philosophical conflict lacks the gritty human nuance of a truly "dueling" interior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Despite ambitious thematic cohesion, the story’s tightrope walk between abstraction and narrative momentum wobbles—elements like the lighthouse and sock feel atmospherically essential but under-explored in plot function. The ending lingers conceptually but fails to viscerally crystallize its ideas.</comment>
