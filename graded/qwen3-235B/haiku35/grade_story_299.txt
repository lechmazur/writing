<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (preserving tradition) is clear and aligns with traits, but lacks emotional depth; internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elegant mood but minimal plot progression; lacks resolution or rising tension despite cohesive themes. Pacing meanders within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Chalk cliffs and artist colony create vivid, resonant atmosphere; sensory details like amber's glow and church bells masterfully evoke "cheerful gloom."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (cliffs/brooch as heritage), though emotional impact diluted by detached narration; ending feels unresolved yet thematically consistent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vocabulary avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on "fragile," "delicate" clich√©s; Elena's rationality feels overly calculated, lacking human emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>All elements integrated cohesively; brevity emphasizes theme over plot; leaves lingering questions about cultural preservation vs. modernity without feeling contrived.</comment>
