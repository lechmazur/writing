<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are conceptually clear but inconsistently dramatized; actions frequently illustrate her role as cultural guardian but lack grounded psychological complexity or interpersonal stakes to fully realize 'jaded wonder.'</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum relies on symbolic convergence (the final leaf) but lacks coherent cause-effect progression; metaphysical elements disrupt narrative urgency through abstraction that muddies structural cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting's metaphysical contradictions (floating orchard, steel-gray seas) create visual intrigue but overwhelm with overwrought, inconsistent metaphors; atmospheric details often substitute spectacle for meaningful environmental interaction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic architecture (locked cultural memory, ancestral resistance) elevates the work, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than viscerally dramatized through character experience or concrete action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avant-garde approach avoids genre tropes but falters in overelaborated metaphors ('orchard as communication network') that border on algorithmic hyperbole; original conceptual framing weakened by uneven specificity in implementation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>High-concept ambition successfully synthesizes elements into thematic tapestry, yet sacrifices narrative tension and emotional texture; feels more like annotated fragments than fully inhabitable story-world despite provocative core ideas.</comment>
