<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are heavily stated rather than revealed through action; "objectively emotional" is conceptually intriguing but lacks human nuance in motivations or reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Minimal plot progression; lacks causal momentum between conceptual elements. The brief space allows for poetic ambiance rather than a structured arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric atmosphere with strong sensory details ("whispers of travelers," "amber reflections"), though the airport lounge setting leans on vague surrealism over tangible worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("map of hidden hours") and thematic resonance about home as negotiation are undercut by abstract, often declarative introspection over emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Escapes overt clich√©s but occasionally dips into ornate descriptions ("tides of compromise") and conceptual vagueness that feel algorithmically generated rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually rich but sacrifices narrative urgency for philosophical musing. Cohesion hinges on thematic glue rather than organic cause-and-effect.</comment>
