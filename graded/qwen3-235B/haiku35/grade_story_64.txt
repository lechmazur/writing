<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's 'uncertain alchemist' label lacks development; motivation is abstract (safeguarding "something precious") rather than concrete, weakening emotional grounding. Intellectual obsession dominates over nuanced human traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot or progression; operates as a meditative vignette. The "coded scuffs" mechanism is underdeveloped, and judicial proceedings mentioned but abandoned. Tension exists thematically, not structurally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with floating marketplace's creaking wood and shifting light. Sensory details (shadows, luminescence) deepen the liminality theme. The setting mirrors the story's philosophical stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mix of strong metaphors ('balance between known/unknown') and abstract musings. The ending provokes thought but lacks emotional payoff. Leans on expository introspection rather than immersive action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with the marketplace but occasionally slips into ornate prose. Some fresh concepts (biological renewal via mythical scale) but repetitive phrasing ("transformation," "fluid time") and insufficient subtext weaken originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cohesive theme but uneven execution. Assigned elements feel decorative rather than integral—the verdict, mapping trails, and "technically wild" concept are superficially tied to the narrative rather than shaping its core.</comment>
