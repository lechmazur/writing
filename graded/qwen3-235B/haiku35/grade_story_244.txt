<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt and 'reserved boldness' are present but underdeveloped; actions align with motivation yet lack emotional depth or nuanced evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc within constraints, but pacing feels rushed during mask-to-map transition; ending resolves logically but lacks tension payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids gross clich√©s in mask-as-map, but 'half-truth historians' feel generic; prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</comment><grade>Elements cohere but unevenly prioritize; neon shop's uniqueness matters, but some components (petal drop) feel loosely connected to plot momentum.</grade>
