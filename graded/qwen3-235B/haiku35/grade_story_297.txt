<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has strong thematic ties to assigned traits but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but feel more like plot devices than fully realized internal drives. Dialogue is stylized but not deeply personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying structural symmetry and clear cause-effect but feels compressed; tension between tradition and modernity exists but lacks time to develop stakes or consequences within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory details excel in creating immersive volcanic-coffee shop atmosphere; setting meaningfully connects to themes through sound (steam-as-eruption) and visual motifs, though geographical elements feel slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes intellectual curiosity rather than deep emotion; metaphors (skin-as-manuscript) are memorable but occasionally drift toward abstraction. Ending feels poetic but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visionary concept undermined by occasional clich√©s ("living map," "untold journeys"). Sensory details often specific but occasionally default to overdetermined descriptors ("mysterious energy"). Tension between tradition and rebellion lacks nuanced personal conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Idea-rich but emotionally distant; elements mostly cohesive though some forced allegiances (e.g., coffee shop connection to Andean motifs). Strong central metaphor but thinness of character psychology limits lasting impact.</comment>
