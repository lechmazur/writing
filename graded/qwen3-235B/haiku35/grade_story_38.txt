<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation regarding non-violence is clear but lacks psychological complexity; actions (drunken confessions) feel conceptually driven rather than organically human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structure follows a linear preparation arc but lacks dramatic progression; thematic coherence exists despite minimal narrative momentum within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with precise sensory details (dust, creaking wood) but the "empty abundance" concept remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors coexist with familiar tropes ("haunted attic," insomniac poet); botanical samples offer originality but some phrasing feels self-consciously literary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution prioritizes thematic scaffolding over narrative urgency; elements fit technically yet lack organic vibrancy.</comment>
