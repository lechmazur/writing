<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character defined by exposition rather than organic revelation; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. Internal monologue lacks depth in tying traits to coherent psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot driven by assigned action but constrained by word limit; key connections (planetarium's role, cracks-as-conduit) feel underdeveloped. Pacing uneven with abrupt shifts in causal logic (e.g., doll's sentience emerging without buildup).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in setting (dusty mirrors, porcelain texture) establish eerie atmosphere, but timeframe ("dawn’s second breath") remains abstract rather than shaping narrative urgency. Spatial coherence weakens in final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (cracks as history, doll as "conduit") and atmospheric tension elevate impact, but emotional resonance limited by over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("inevitable cosmic design") over visceral showing. Ending gestures toward transformation without committing to its consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Relies on overused tropes (haunted protector, sentient doll) without subversion. Excessive adjectives dilute focus; internal logic (e.g., doll’s "electric current" affecting protagonist) borders on vague mysticism. Originality evident in circus-dresser-room setting but undercut by predictable arc.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements incorporated but not fully integrated—planetarium encounter feels grafted onto plot. Storytelling shows potential for depth but settles for surface-level mythologizing. Tone inconsistent in final paragraphs (liminal space dissolution lacks payoff).</comment>
