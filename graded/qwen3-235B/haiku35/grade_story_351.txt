<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but introspection remains superficial; actions align with traits but lack emotional complexity or growth. Voice/psychology remains generalized despite poetic context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists via riddle-solving arc, but pacing stumbles—exposition-heavy buildup resolves too abruptly. Causal connections between symbolic elements (sundial activation?) remain underdeveloped despite strong initial momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully immersive, with specific sensory details (shifting ivy shadows, tactile wax seal description) creating visceral liminality. Setting functions as organic extension of thematic preoccupations about time and erasure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphysical imagery and symbolic subtext elevates impact. Ending lacks emotional catharsis but provides thematic closure. Some "showing" over "telling" achieved, though psychological nuances are occasionally stated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through specific historical-linguistic metaphors, but certain descriptors ("whispering ivy," "meditation-like tracing") edge toward atmospheric overfamiliarity. Tone remains consistent, though wax seal's supernatural resolution risks veering into fantasy tropes without sufficient mytho-poetic foundation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric vignette but feels conceptually overdetermined—some elements (sundial, rebus seal) risk functioning as literary MacGuffins rather than organic components. Lingering thematic resonance outweighs structural imperfections.</comment>
