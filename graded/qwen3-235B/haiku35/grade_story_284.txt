<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's stoic professionalism is clear but underdeveloped; the sudden emotional shift feels under-motivated despite effective symbolic use of the paper plane. Core transformation lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Paper plane as catalyst works but feels imposed rather than organically integrated; pacing balances setup and revelation but strains credibility within tight word count. Resolution feels abrupt yet thematically coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (bees, wooden hives, residual vibrations) create immersive sensory duality of industrial radio tech and organic sanctuary; time-frame specificity enhances melancholic tension between transience and permanence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Paper plane symbolism and theme of communication-as-connection resonate; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on declarative statements ("sincerity...subversive") rather than fully embodied subtext. Ending gains strength through understated revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by clichéd "transformative stranger" trope; atmospheric elements feel fresh but some phrases ("methodical work," "unexpected journeys") verge on machine-generated generality. Nuanced voice moments contrast with formulaic emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Element cohesion uneven – paper plane and sanctuary work synergistically while wallet-return incident feels contrived; brief length highlights structural ambition but sacrifices narrative depth. Lingering thematic impact outweighs mechanical imperfections.</comment>
