<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks internal conflict or evolution; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through action or meaningful reaction to assigned elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Risks of fragmented narrative realized: episodic descriptions replace coherent plot progression; vague stakes and unresolved tension undermine structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion through tactile details (herbs, cables) enhances mood, but atmospheric flourishes insufficiently tethered to narrative functionality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Potent themes of communication and reconciliation hinted at via metaphor, but emotional impact diluted by abstract, declarative self-praise of "revolution" without tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Formulaic "literary" tropes (philosophical custodians, vaults as memory) paired with strained metaphors ("dried herbs" as forced symbolism); language often prioritizes ornament over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Conceptually striking but executionally diffuse; elements exist in parallel rather than synergy, creating impressionistic vignette over fully realized story.</comment>
