<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character’s obsession with crosswords links to her mission but remains abstract, making her more a vessel for ideas than a living character with nuanced conflicts or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks narrative arc; static tableau of preparation and beginning. No clear middle or resolution, relying on atmosphere over plot progression within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic descriptors (e.g., “amber lamp,” “elongated shadows”) without immersive specificity. “Whisper collection point” feels arbitrarily attached to the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., diaries as seeds) are conceptually rich but underexplored. Ending offers no resolution, leaving themes adrift. Writing style prioritizes abstraction over emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans into ornate prose (“surgical delicacy,” “fractured by time”) that feels artificial. Emotional beats are stated rather than layered through subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; the brevity highlights disjointedness rather than deliberate minimalism. Themes of reconciliation remain underdeveloped.</comment>
