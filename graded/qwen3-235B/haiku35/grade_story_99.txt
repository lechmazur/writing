<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits like "strictly casual" are stated but underdeveloped, while telekinesis as a narrative device reveals motivation through action. Chopstick wrapper connection is conceptually strong but lacks emotional nuance in execution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Flashbacks drive abstract thematic progression but create disjointed pacing. Plot completion is implied rather than dramatized. Memory-trigger mechanism feels contrived rather than organic to narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid carnival decay creates memorable atmosphere, but chopstick wrapper clashes with setting specificity. Sensory details enhance mood while timeframe's abstraction strains immersion through conflicting temporal scales.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors about narrative power resonate thematically but occasionally tip into abstract vagueness. Ending provides intellectual satisfaction over emotional impact, maintaining conceptual coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some purple prose ("fragments of collective memory") and schematic structure suggest algorithmic tendencies. Object-setting dissonance (carnival + chopstick wrapper) and underexplored motivations weaken authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate conceptually but lack visceral engagement. Brevity serves thematic abstraction over narrative urgency. Concept-driven cohesion outweighs emotional immediacy in final impression.</comment>
