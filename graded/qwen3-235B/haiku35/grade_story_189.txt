<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's "bright-eyed" trait isn't deeply integrated into actions/thoughts; motivation is clear but lacks psychological complexity; reactions to objects and concepts feel surface-level rather than revealing layered personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear progression but feels compressed; beginning/end connection is logical yet formulaic; cause/effect relationships hold but pacing occasionally lapses into exposition-heavy passages within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cold stone walls, humming energy) create immersive atmosphere; setting/timeframe symbiosis enhances thematic weight; haunted lighthouse becomes active participant in narrative rather than passive backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Conceptual metaphors (e.g. key as bridge) and thematic coherence (survival/hope) are present but surface-level; prose occasionally elevates beyond simplicity but lacks profound emotional resonance or stylistic memorability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in premise but contains familiar post-apocalyptic tropes (cataclysmic war, lone genius protagonist); language balances between functional and overwrought; shows flashes of originality but lacks fully subversive approach to genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively integrated with uneven depth; short length both strength (tightly focused narrative) and weakness (underdeveloped implications); clear creative thinking in tech/ritual amalgamation leaves lingering conceptual questions.</comment>
