<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but thinly developed; the gambler's mindset and candle mold connection hint at complexity but lack emotional depth or nuanced behavioral contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing struggles balance between scientific build-up and climax; dockside experiment creates tension but final act feels abrupt, weakened by underexplored stakes despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of Nova Scotia's coastal atmosphere through sensory details contrasts artificial elements like midnight lectures; candlelit dinners better integrate setting with thematic tension between chaos and control.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Impressive metaphoric layering (gambling/science/bargains) but inconsistent emotional payoff; candle mold's symbolic potential undercut by lack of resolution in its interaction with experimental results.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Unique premise blending quantum theory with personal ruin occasionally lapses into florid description ("laughing tears oscillate"); metaphors fresh but some procedural elements (lectures, tidal data) feel troped rather than transformed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Limited emotional resonance despite atmospheric strengths; cohesive structure strained by abrupt character dynamics (Harriet's ambiguous role) and unresolved connections between assigned elements.</comment>
