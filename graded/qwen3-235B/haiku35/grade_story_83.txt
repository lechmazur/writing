<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated; the "suspiciously trusting" attribute lacks nuanced integration; motivation remains abstract rather than driving specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>No clear narrative arc or progression; action elements (tracing burn patterns, evidence collection) don't generate momentum or consequence within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Broken mirror setting creates strong visual atmosphere, but sensory details remain superficial; leaf raking timing feels arbitrarily juxtaposed rather than thematically connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overuse of clich√©d metaphors ("hunter tracking prey") and excessive, unearned abstractions ("seeds of a better tomorrow" without tangible stakes) dilute emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on genre tropes (sentient mirrors, cryptic codes) without subversion; inconsistent tone shifts between scientific procedural and metaphysical mystery suggest formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements like "mischievous wisdom" and "potential futures" feel imposed rather than organic; short length amplifies structural gaps rather than creating deliberate concision.</comment>
