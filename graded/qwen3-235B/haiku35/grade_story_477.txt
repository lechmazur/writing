<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is primarily thematic construct rather than psychologically nuanced entity; sword symbolism reinforces concept but lacks physical/mental contradictions that might humanize him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sparse narrative arc achieves minimal cohesion through signal discovery mechanism; tension between tech salvaging and ideological revelation insufficiently developed within confined space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid underwater juxtapositions create immersive atmosphere; inconsistent auditory elements (bird songs underwater) undermine sensory credibility despite strong visual/textural details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective use of duality symbolism (sword as liberation tool, TVs as dual-purpose tech) elevates concept; emotional engagement limited by absence of tangible character interactions or stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Genre-blending setting shows ingenuity but strained through broken TV/cosmic signal method; some sensory descriptions cross into ornate abstraction without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambitions outweigh execution; elements combined cleverly but occasionally function as checklist rather than organically interwoven components of compressed narrative.</comment>
