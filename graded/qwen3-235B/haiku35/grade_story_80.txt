<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is thinly developed; traits are described but not demonstrated through meaningful action or conflict. Motivation is hinted at but remains vague and lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot exists but feels compressed; the story builds atmosphere but lacks a complete arc due to underdeveloped cause-effect and abrupt ending. Pacing is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective sensory details and atmospheric setting create tension, though deeper integration between objects and world logic is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative prose with strong imagery and subtext. Theme of obsession emerges but is undercut by the narrative's incompleteness and lack of emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Combines tropes with minor inventiveness (housekeeping logs) but relies on clich√©d explorer/ancient artifact motifs. Avoids purple prose but lacks nuanced emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story has cohesion but feels like a fragment of a larger work. Elements are serviceable but not fully exploited for maximum narrative impact or originality.</comment>
