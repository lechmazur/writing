<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Helena's traits (precision, tradition-driven) are clear, but inner conflict and depth beyond professional devotion remain underexplored. Her glamour feels aesthetic rather than intrinsic to character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot centers on a static ritual without traditional arc; the 1947 record upload adds minimal momentum. Coherence maintained but lacks tension or transformative conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory contrasts (emerald scarf vs. funeral black, cold skin vs. chemical hues) create a haunting atmosphere enhancing the "myth of ordinariness." Some elements (archive) underintegrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (measuring tape as oral history) and thematic weight elevate the story, but explicit declarations about "myth" and "dignity" dilute subtext. Ending achieves poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept marred by sporadic purple prose ("glamorous appearance... meticulously orchestrated") and the archive's contrived modernity. Emotional nuance present but occasionally undercut by overt explanation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive yet safeâ€”elements service atmosphere but lack daring interplay. The brevity suits the vignette style, but the lingering impact leans more on imagery than existential resonance.</comment>
