<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's traits (poet, ambivalence) are present but motivation lacks emotional grounding and personal stakes. Reactions to dice and environment don’t fully reveal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette with no strong throughline. Causal connections are vague; the constrained format prevents development of a complete arc or payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create mood (e.g., vibrating brass, prismatic light), but the worldbuilding feels surface-level—settings lack integration with plot progression or thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong imagery and conceptual hints at cosmic themes, but emotional resonance is muted. The ending’s ambiguity feels under-earned rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combines esoteric elements with steampunk stylings in a fresh way, but occasionally veers into ornateness. Deeper emotional nuance and tighter pacing would strengthen authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stylistically distinctive but uneven in cohesion. The elements are present but often disconnected from a unified narrative or character-driven purpose.</comment>
