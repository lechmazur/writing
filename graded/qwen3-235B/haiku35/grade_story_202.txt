<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits shape atmosphere more than emotional depth; motivations remain abstract concept rather than psychologically grounded behavior. Paradoxical nature feels imposed rather than organically demonstrated through specific choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Action drives plot surface-level but lacks escalation; method makes internal logic sense but external coherence suffers. Ending lacks resolution despite word constraints, with cause-effect connections between clues feeling arbitrary rather than interconnected.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting creates rich visual atmosphere with "dusty starlight" contrast, but skateboarding timeframe only superficially integrated. Sensory details lean heavily on sight at expense of other senses; object-setting connection primarily symbolic rather than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Emotionally muted; relies on abstract metaphors over visceral impact. Some effective imagery (skateboarder as metaphor) but lacks consistent theme exploration. Subtext about human vulnerability remains intellectualized rather than emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Riddled with purple prose and repetitive descriptors ("deliberate and precise", "carefully calculated"). Relies on "poetic" clich√©s without fresh perspective. Mechanical puzzle section betrays overly logical character behavior; metaphors feel forced rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements included but artificially glued together. Story structure prioritizes checklist of assigned elements over cohesive narrative flow. Brevity used as excuse for underdeveloped concept execution rather than purposeful constraint.</comment>
