<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character feels abstract rather than realized; motivations stated but not demonstrated through action or internal conflict. Lacks distinct voice or emotional depth beyond vague "rebellious spirit".</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Plot exists as fragmented vignettes rather than structured narrative. Key transitions (laundromat to study) underdeveloped. Ending lacks tangible resolution or arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly rendered through specific sensory details (moonlight through stained glass, trembling flower). Setting evokes mood but doesn't actively shape character decisions or plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (flower folds as neural pathways) but leans into abstract exposition rather than dramatic tension. Fails to create emotional investment despite thematic ambitions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Over-reliance on flowery abstractions ("interconnected membrane of consciousness") and predictable spiritual metaphors. Sensory details often generic. Philosophical concept over-explained rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story's elements coexist rather than coalesce - setting, character, and concept remain loosely connected. Conceptual depth undermined by execution. Ambitious but insufficiently realized within constraints.</comment>
