<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or emotional nuance; motivation remains abstract rather than visceral. Assigned traits shape philosophical musings more than concrete behavior or development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on cyclical thematic statements rather than forward momentum. Assigned action ("recompose") and method ("heartbreak-induced visions") create conceptual framework but no coherent narrative arc. Pacing uneven - resolves too neatly for its own ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors overwhelm concrete sensory details. The unstable dimension reflects internal states effectively but lacks tangible qualities (sounds, textures). Atmospheric concept overshadows environmental specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Evocative phrasing (e.g., "scalpel through membrane-thin reality"), but intellectual concepts dominate over emotional impact. Subtext about rationality vs. emotion resonates, though execution feels didactic. Ending lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Formulaic transitions between abstract concepts; sensory details often generic ("fluid abstractions"). Over-reliance on paradoxical phrasing feels like stylistic evasion. Empathy-as-bridge concept lacks human-scale specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Elements present but frequently decorative rather than transformative. Theoretical richness fails to coalesce into compelling narrative architecture. Length feels like constraint rather than aesthetic choice.</comment>
