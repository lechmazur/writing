<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character lacks nuanced psychology; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated. Inner conflict remains underdeveloped despite poetic descriptions of the tablecloth's significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression, but tension is diffuse. The catapult's mechanics and temporal collapse implications could use more concrete grounding within the story's constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with electromagnetic pulses and borrowed dawn, but sensory engagement remains superficial. The atom-powered lighthouse's mechanics aren't fully leveraged to deepen the story's existential themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (stitches as wounds) and symbolic storytelling elevate the narrative. The ending's emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract language, weakening its philosophical weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains occasionally overwritten passages ("quietly defiant bridge between ending and beginning"). Sensory details show invention but occasionally veer into aesthetic excess without thematic purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements creates haunting vignette. While the self-contained narrative works within constraints, the condensed form occasionally obscures deeper thematic development potential.</comment>
