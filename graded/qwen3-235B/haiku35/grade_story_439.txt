<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are explicitly stated but underdemonstrated; Aria's muteness and "unassumingly bold" nature lack concrete behavioral manifestations. Motivation feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded, relying on philosophical concepts over tangible character decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Routine ritual supplants plot; minimal cause-effect progression despite atmospheric momentum. The story's circular structure (beginning/middle/end) feels schematic rather than organically earned within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Visually rich but derivative setting; storm-harbor-operahouse combination leans on gothic tropes without revelatory detail. Sensory immersion occasionally overwhelms narrative purpose, with snow and decay overused as mood substitutes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pretty prose obscures emotional vacancy. Metaphors like "snowflakes as realities" show surface cleverness but lack subtextual depth. Ending fails to resolve or reframe tension, leaving thematic threads dangling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Vocabulary veers between overwrought ("unassumingly bold") and vague ("cautious enchantment"). Relies on mystical sci-fi clich√©s without twisting expectations; comet's role feels like cosmic hand-waving rather than inventive plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Displays technical competence but lacks urgent artistic purpose. Elements cohere into a pastiche of better surreal fiction, feeling more like a moodboard than a story with existential stakes or formal innovation.</comment>
