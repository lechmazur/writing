<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "critical" and "openly secretive" are stated but underdemonstrated; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance in how they drive Elena's specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression through diary reconstruction is conceptually cohesive but feels truncated; the maelstrom's symbolic role emerges abruptly, and the arc lacks fully earned momentum within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mystical, sensorially rich setting (swirling maelstrom, whispering orchard) is masterfully rendered, with lavender/sage aromatics and lunar imagery creating an immersive, mythic atmosphere that hauntingly mirrors the theme of fragmented memory.</comment>
