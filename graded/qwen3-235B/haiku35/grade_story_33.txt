<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Characters exist as abstract concepts rather than flesh-and-blood individuals; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Incidents accumulate without clear progression; thematic statements dominate over plot mechanics, resulting in static circularity rather than narrative movement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes often cross into purple prose; while conceptually original, the clinical detachment of character thought processes feels artificial rather than contemplative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>High-concept elements coexist thematically but lack narrative urgency; the brevity works against emotional grounding rather than enhancing it through contrast.</comment>
