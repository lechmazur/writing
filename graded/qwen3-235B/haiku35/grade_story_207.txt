<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's actions lack nuance; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through organic behavior. The "meekly assertive" trait remains superficial, never fully realized in behavior or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot advances through exposition-driven revelations rather than dramatic momentum. The arc from oath-breaking intention to resolution feels truncated despite thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setting relies on sci-fi clich√©s (abandoned station, sterile corridors) without specific, immersive details. Atmosphere is abstract rather than visceral, missing opportunities for environmental symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "operating theater of past wounds") are conceptually rich but underdeveloped, leaning on familiar imagery without fresh execution. Emotional impact is muted by over-reliance on summary.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Structure follows a predictable redemption arc. Purple prose ("melodic backdrop") and generic descriptors (e.g., "spectral silence") suggest formulaic embellishment rather than authentic voice or subversive creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not exceptional; cohesion exists at surface level. The brief format highlights underdeveloped tensions and a conclusion that feels abrupt rather than resonant.</comment>
