<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through conflict or transformation. Internal consistency between immortality and actions is vague, and the "voice" feels more expository than immersive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum or discernible structure. While the concept influences atmosphere, thereâ€™s no clear arc, cause-effect progression, or tension within the word limit. Pacing is stagnant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., luminescent fungi, crystalline rock) create a strong atmosphere. The "mundanely glorious" setting works conceptually, but deeper integration with character actions or themes is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Combines existential themes with poetic metaphors ("resurrection," "living archive") to provoke thought. Ending resonates as a philosophical statement, though emotional impact is diluted by detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Concepts feel derivative (mole people, post-cosmic extinction) but are elevated by unique framing (digitizing memory as resurrection). Some purple prose ("gifted burden") and underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are conceptually cohesive but lack narrative synergy. The brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful; themes linger, but execution leaves the story feeling like an incomplete sketch.</comment>
