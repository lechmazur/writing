<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and consistent traits but lacks psychological depth; actions align with motivations but depth feels surface-level due to poetic abstraction dominating over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure shows clear beginning/middle/end within constraints but suffers from compressed pacing; thematic momentum present but transitional beats between key moments feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (sour phial, tidal sounds) effectively establish mood; setting functions symbolically but could more deeply integrate with character's transformation mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (transformation as rebellion) and symbolic resonance present; emotional impact partially diluted by poetic overstatement and underdeveloped stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mix of fresh imagery ("resolutely wavering") and slightly overwrought phrasing; thematically conventional yet conceptually ambitious, with uneven integration of some elements creating artificial tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competently cohesive but derivative in thematic execution; brevity used effectively but lacks transformative originality to elevate beyond competent genre fiction toward literary distinction.</comment>
