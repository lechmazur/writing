<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivation to "restore lost faith" feels abstract and underdeveloped beyond surface descriptions of restlessness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks narrative progression, cause-effect logic, or satisfying structural arc; tension exists only in overwritten metaphors, not through character action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but occasionally veers into clich√© (fireflies as metaphor); sensory details are rich but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (postcards, chalkboard) elevates the narrative; emotional resonance undercut by over-reliance on abstract introspection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fragmented cohesion; concepts are serviceable but lack narrative urgency; thematic interest outweighs execution within tight constraints.</comment>
