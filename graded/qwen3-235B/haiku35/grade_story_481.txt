<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; metaphors dominate over tangible actions revealing her as a person, resulting in thematic consistency without psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predictable arc (presentation-as-climax) constrained by word limit; assigned elements like the forge and dragonfly are symbolic but underutilized to drive plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through sensory contrasts (forge vs. sterile ward), though some details (e.g., preserved dragonfly) verge on archly poetic rather than serving spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent use of metaphor (dragonfly, forge) elevates thematic resonance; ending feels earned through layered symbolism, though slight overreliance on conceptual abstraction weakens immediate emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate prose; metaphors like "clinical indifference" are fresh, yet the narrative’s reliance on high abstraction over concrete human detail feels slightly formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive in concept, but strained execution: some elements (forge as method, distantly intimate tone) feel imposed rather than organically integrated into character-driven momentum.</comment>
