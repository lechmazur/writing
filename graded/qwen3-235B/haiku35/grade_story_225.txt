<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Presentation of motivation feels overly expository; emotional depth of her "unconventional love" lacks nuanced subtext or visceral reactions that would make her obsession psychologically compelling. Reactions to ostracism remain abstract rather than embodied in specific character choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc from setup to vindication, but pivotal moment of decoding signals feels truncated. The connection between electromagnetic method and butterfly response lacks technical specificity that would ground the miracle scientifically. Pacing maintains momentum but sacrifices tension through quick success.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine's sensory details (creaking metal, copper pipes) create immersive atmosphere, but historical timeframe's broken treaties remain superficial adornment rather than shaping narrative stakes. The setting's mechanical wonder contrasts with butterfly subject matter but doesn't deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (sub as "restless spirit", pen as "talisman") demonstrate literary ambition but remain uninterrogated. Emotional impact diluted by heavy exposition; character interiority and ethical quandaries of "infecting" environments deserve dramatization rather than summary.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through butterfly-electromagnetism synthesis and moral ambiguity of scientific obsession. Some phrases ("battered marvel") border on artificial poetics. Character voice maintains stylistic consistency but sacrifices human illogic in favor of archetypal eccentric genius tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Stylistic flourishes elevate technical descriptions but fail to fully reconcile steampunk machinery with delicate lepidopterology theme. The brief length works for vignette-style revelation but limits exploration of philosophical implications or interpersonal stakes.</comment>
