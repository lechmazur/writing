<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lyrian remains an archetypal figure rather than a realized character; motivations are stated but not earned through action, and her "voice" lacks distinctness beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structure exists in a static, ritualistic loop without conflict or resolution; coherence is maintained but lacks traditional arc momentum within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting merges tech and organic elements with sensory precision; the solar collectorsâ€™ metallic rattling and pulsing leaves create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere supporting the cosmic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (music as universal negotiation) are potent but undercut by vague emotional abstraction; ending evokes lingering questions but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overuse of poetic conventions ("whispers of forgotten landscapes") and lack of authentic humor undercut originality; some phrases feel algorithmically ornate rather than human-observed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper synthesis; style elevates concept but doesn't transcend the assignment into timeless storytelling.</comment>
