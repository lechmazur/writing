<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait (professional dream interpreter) is conceptually tied to the plot, but motivations for systemic disruption remain abstract with minimal emotional grounding or character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Static plot structure with no clear progression—relies on atmospheric tension but lacks cause-effect momentum, resolution, or meaningful stakes within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich but inconsistent sensory details (industrial steam, heat) create a haunting atmosphere, though the setting’s fusion of technology and metaphysics feels underexploited for thematic depth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptions and high-concept jargon verge on purple prose; character logic leans mechanistic, with underdeveloped human nuance beneath systemic themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Story conceptually assembles assigned elements cohesively but fails to transform them into a unified, impactful narrative with a distinct authorial voice or lasting emotional weight.</comment>
