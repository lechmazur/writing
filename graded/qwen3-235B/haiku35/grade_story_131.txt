<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Maya's orphaned aloofness is present but underexplored; her transformation to curiosity lacks nuanced psychological grounding. Internal conflict insufficiently detailed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; key revelations (ticket, anomalies) arrive abruptly without sufficient buildup. Resolution lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (dusty windows, humming stones) but gravitational anomalies feel underdeveloped. Sensory details anchor setting, yet integration with sci-fi elements remains shallow.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses symbols (stones, ticket) effectively but relies on abstract exposition about "quantum possibilities." Ending aims for awe but lacks tangible thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but employs predictable sci-fi tropes (gravitational anomalies, cryptic messages). Writing avoids formulaic transitions but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere minimally; gravitational anomaly feels tacked on. Brevity limits development but doesn't inherently serve the concept. Memorable imagery undercut by thin thematic scaffolding.</comment>
