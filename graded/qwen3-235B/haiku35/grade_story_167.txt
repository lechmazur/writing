<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth and psychological complexity; external descriptions of traits don't fully manifest in specific, differentiated behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc within constraints; thematic consistency between beginning (well discovery) and end (impending test) creates momentum, though conclusion feels anticipatory rather than resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully combines scientific and mystical elements; sensory details (humming capsules, gleaming coil) enhance the setting's paradoxical tension and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich, thematically cohesive storytelling; the core concept of emotional transmission generates philosophical questions, though some abstract thematic material could be more concretely embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some overwritten metaphors and tonal inconsistencies (e.g., "earthbound flight") hint at formulaic tendencies, but the emotional transmission concept demonstrates authentic innovation with occasional stylistic overreach.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically but not with transformative cohesion; the story establishes compelling tension between science/spirituality but leaves its full implications underexplored due to format constraints.</comment>
