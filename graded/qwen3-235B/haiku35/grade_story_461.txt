<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and symbolic reactions to objects, but explorer trait feels underutilized beyond frustration. Internal conflict is well-presented, but deeper exploration of irate tendencies would strengthen development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has reflective arc but suffers from condensed progression. The meditation method lacks detailed implementation, making the resolution feel rushed despite thematic cohesiveness between beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly constructed through precise sensory details (candlelight, dragonfly trembling, aged curtains). The setting strongly reinforces generational silence theme but could better integrate timelessness of the bedroom.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (emotional archaeology, heartbeat rhythm) and symbolic gestures present. Ending feels purposeful, but emotional resonance lacks the visceral depth needed for maximum impact in a short narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s by reimagining familial trauma as rhythmic healing. Some phrases border on flowery ("generational currents"), but unique voice and symbolic specificity elevate originality despite minor formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are integrated thematically but unevenly executed. Word limit shapes the story effectively, though certain components (like meditation method) require more nuanced handling for full cohesion and lasting resonance.</comment>
