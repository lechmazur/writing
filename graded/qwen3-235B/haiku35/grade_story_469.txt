<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character traits like "logically emotional precision" are vaguely defined and lack concrete behavioral manifestation; motivations are conceptually intriguing but remain abstract, making emotional connection difficult.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Countdown structure creates artificial tension, but the plot lacks meaningful stakes or consequences for failure; resolution feels preordained rather than earned through narrative development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned research station evokes haunting decay through sensory details like jasmine scent and whispering acoustics, though geological/timeless elements remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery ("geological layers of silence") and concept-driven metaphors engage intellectually, but excessive abstraction weakens emotional resonance; ending resolves plot but not thematic questions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in intellectual themes (mapping human potential) contrasts with formulaic elements like terminal countdown and vaguely mystical key; poetic language occasionally veers into pretentiousness without deeper emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>While conceptually ambitious, execution unevenly balances assigned elements - atmospheric details succeed while character psychology and narrative tension feel artificially constructed rather than organically developed.</comment>
