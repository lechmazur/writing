<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (cultural preservation through coded resistance) is clear but lacks emotional depth; "reliably unreliable" trait informs actions superficially without exploring contradictions or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical structure (nightwork-to-dawn) but lacks substantial conflict; encoded fortunes drive the concept, yet progression feels static, relying on exposition over tangible stakes or setbacks.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting blends oppressive regime with mystical remnants effectively—fractured mirrors, salvaged tile—but atmospheric elements (e.g., oracle’s tea leaves) lean heavily on familiar dystopian aesthetics rather than unique cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery (fragmented tile as cultural memory, coded rice paper) and themes of linguistic resistance resonate, but over-reliance on explanatory metaphors ("most powerful messages look mundane") diminishes subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into ornamental phrasing ("kaleidoscope studio’s fractured light," "ancient energy"); resistance tropes are retooled rather than subverted, and the oracle’s role feels perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements thematically (language as resistance, cultural continuity) but prioritizes concept over narrative tension; brevity serves poetic resonance over emotional immersion.</comment>
