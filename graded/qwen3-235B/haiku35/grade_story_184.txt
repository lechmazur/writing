<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is abstract and existential but lacks human depth or relatable conflict; actions show enigmatic behavior but lack emotional or psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as a static tone poem rather than linear progression; coherence maintained through recurring motifs but lacks cause-effect dynamics or narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting blends sterile science and cosmic mysticism effectively; sensory details (resonating shells, backward river projection) create tangible wonder but occasionally verge on overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echoes philosophical themes through rich metaphors and recursive structure; emotionally distancing due to lack of character interiority or concrete stakes despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but flirts with pretentiousness; some phrases ("contained energy pregnant with transformation") risk veering into self-important abstraction rather than earned originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution prioritizes atmosphere over narrative payoff; brief format works for poetic vignette but struggles to deliver holistic story satisfaction.</comment>
