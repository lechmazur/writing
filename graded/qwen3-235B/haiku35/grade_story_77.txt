<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated through actions or concrete interactions; motivations remain abstract and underexplored, with minimal emotional investment in the protagonist's journey.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Circular narrative lacks structural progression; the metaphorical "revolution" is disconnected from concrete plot mechanics, while the abrupt resolution with the marionette's completion feels unearned and symbolic rather than narratively satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setting functions primarily as superficial dressing rather than an active element; sensory details are inconsistently applied, with the asteroid base and space pirate elements never fully integrated into the protagonist's mission or emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors and underdeveloped symbolism overshadow nuanced craftsmanship; the central theme of empathy-driven revolution lacks tangible demonstration through character interactions or concrete outcomes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Reliance on vague abstractions ("drowsy enthusiasm," "mountain wisdom"), overused literary devices, and formulaic phrasing undermines originality; emotional resonance is sacrificed in favor of poetic posturing that feels more algorithmic than authentic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements are superficially connected rather than organically integrated; the overtly metaphorical approach sacrifices narrative clarity and emotional engagement, offering intellectual concepts without human-scale stakes or payoff.</comment>
