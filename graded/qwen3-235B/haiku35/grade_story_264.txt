<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character displays consistent traits (eccentric, meticulous, idealistic), but lacks introspection that could deepen motivation. The juxtaposition of "infinite caution" with "unruly" experimentation is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Builds tension through experiment progression, but lacks traditional arc in tight word limit. The celestial resonance climax feels abrupt - could benefit from clearer cause/effect linking projector hum to reaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vividly rendered laboratory breathes through sensory contrasts: "hauntingly cheerful" lighting, crackling radio, pulsing glow. Timeframe element ("between innings") cleverly establishes liminal atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cracked lens amplifying possibility" offers strong metaphor. Ending's thematic resonance about scientific curiosity works conceptually but lacks emotional gut-punch through showing rather than telling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("dance of light and sound that suggested something extraordinary"). Sensory details feel purposefully chosen rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Successfully integrates most assigned elements organically, particularly projector's hum connecting to celestial frequencies. Some elements (baseball innings) feel more decorative than essential.</comment>
