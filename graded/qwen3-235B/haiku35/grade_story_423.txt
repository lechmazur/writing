<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete development and distinct voice; motivation is clear but remains abstract and philosophical rather than emotionally grounded, with little psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but static, revolving around reflection rather than action; lacks a clear narrative arc beyond thematic repetition, though the word limit is managed without feeling overcrowded.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory details evoke atmosphere effectively, but connections between setting and character psychology are underdeveloped; ruined aqueduct and greenhouse feel symbolic without deeper narrative integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the story; themes of interconnectedness resonate emotionally, though abstract introspection occasionally overshadows concrete narrative progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into decorative abstraction ("crisp nostalgia," "celestial pathways") that feels stylized rather than organic; philosophical tone is distinctive but risks sounding contrived.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent and stylistically strong, but prioritizes thematic messaging over character depth or plot momentum; lingering resonance stems from concepts rather than narrative execution.</comment>
