<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like emotional isolation and motivation to outrun past are clear but underdeveloped; emotional depth feels told rather than shown. The "lovelorn" aspect is superficially referenced but not central to her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; coherence is maintained through mood rather than narrative structure. Moment of clarity provides minimal arc, but overall static tension weakens momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details and atmospheric decay effectively enhance mood. However, some cyberpunk elements verge on cliché, slightly diluting originality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Purposeful metaphors (e.g., sticky label as identity) work well, but emotional resonance is thin. Ending reinforces theme of fragmentation without resolving tension, which is conceptually satisfying but emotionally distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through introspective character voice and symbolic details. Relies on familiar cyberpunk templates but subverts expectations slightly by focusing on emotional detachment rather than action-driven spy tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are generally cohesive but unevenly weighted toward atmosphere over plot. Concludes with thematic consistency but lacks urgency or transformative character moments to anchor its brevity.</comment>
