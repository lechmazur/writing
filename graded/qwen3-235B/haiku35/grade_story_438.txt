<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are conceptually present but underdeveloped; motivation is stated rather than dramatized, and internal conflicts remain unexplored despite mystical-scientific duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative has structural cohesion but leans heavily on expository pacing; the arc from discovery to revelation feels compressed rather than earned, with underexplored cause-effect dynamics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere successfully merges sterile science and maritime mysticism through sensory contrasts (glowing compass vs. lab sterility), though deeper environmental immersion is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors and themes (genetic memory as migration) show ambition, with poetic language elevating the conceptual core, though emotional engagement remains secondary to intellectual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blends original concepts with genre tropes (bio-mysticism); some purple prose ("hollow recklessness") and underdeveloped subtext suggest uneven stylistic control despite inventive premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements form a coherent whole with thematic ambition, though the brevity occasionally prioritizes conceptual scaffolding over emotional or narrative depth; lingers conceptually rather than viscerally.</comment>
