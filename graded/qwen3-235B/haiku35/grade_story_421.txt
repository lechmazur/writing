<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has consistent traits but lacks sufficient demonstration of some assigned attributes in actions/dialogue; motivation exists but isn't deeply interrogated through conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rushed pacing in a tight word limit undermines full plot development; clear throughline but insufficient middle development between beginning/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric imagery creates mood but some assigned elements (coin toss timeframe) remain under-integrated; sensory details occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors and purposeful ending, but relies on telling rather than showing key emotions; theme is clear but subtext could be richer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than average for constraint-heavy writing, but brevity sometimes limits thematic resonance and emotional payoff.</comment>
