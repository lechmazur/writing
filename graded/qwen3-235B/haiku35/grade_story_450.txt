<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character has distinct physicality and symbolic traits but lacks psychological depth; motivation through prophecy feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Sharp-wittedness is asserted, not demonstrated through specific decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prophecy structure creates clear bookends, but compressed arc lacks emotional payoff. Cause-effect between dance and quantum reactions lacks detailed logic; ending feels conceptually complete but emotionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Quantum chamber and bubble bath create contrasting atmospheres, but sensory details remain clinical rather than immersive. Spaceship patch and photos hold symbolic potential unexploited through concrete description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Rich metaphors (dna-as-quantum-bubble-bath) compete with overabstraction; prophecy's twist lacks emotional punch. Subtext about family continuity works better than cosmic themes. Strong imagery but uneven thematic synthesis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dance-prophecy fusion shows ingenuity but relies on "quantum" handwavium typical of soft sci-fi. Some phrases ("architectural model of denial") feel artificially ornate; emotional showing occurs through movement but remains intellectualized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Broad conceptual cohesion exists, but element integration feels calculated rather than organic. The brief length emphasizes structural bones over lived-in emotional reality; thematic hints lack full dramatization.</comment>
