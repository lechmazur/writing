<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is narratively explained more than shown; motivations are clear but lack psychological complexity; the "dishonestly honest" attribute isn't deeply embedded in behavior; voice remains inconsistent between exposition and introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure creates thematic resonance but sacrifices coherence; abrupt transitions between waiting room and flashbacks; plot completeness is artificially imposed rather than organic; the yodeling moment lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Contrasting sterile waiting room with rainforest creates initial tension, but both settings remain superficially rendered; underutilized sensory opportunities, particularly in canopy village; atmosphere doesn't deepen thematic or emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Musical metaphors provide structural unity but feel over-explained; redemption theme is earnest but lacks subversive edge; emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition; conflict remains internalized rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on redemption arc framework without significant innovation; yodeling moment provides uniqueness but borders on gimmick; prose is competent yet derivative, lacking distinctive stylistic signature; subtext feels aspirational rather than realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than symbiosis; brevity undermines depth rather than enhancing it; fails to generate lasting resonance or thematic complexity; shows potential but remains too deliberately constructed to feel authentically affecting.</comment>
