<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear (language of emotions) and aligned with actions, but 'gardener' aspect feels underdeveloped in shaping personality/actions. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite introspective narration</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through object-driven memory revelations. Pacing balances discovery and reflection. Some abrupt shifts between lyrical passages and exposition, but overall effective tension between technology and intuition</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Contrasts sterile translation center with tactile purse details effectively. Bird calls as recurring motif creates auditory texture. Atmosphere richly supports emotional archaeology theme through layered sensory details</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Deepens theme of nonverbal communication through precise symbolism (threads=language). Ending achieves circularity between past/present. Subtle showing of emotion through tactile discoveries rather than telling</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("rivers meeting ocean") and slightly formulaic transitions between paragraphs. Conceptual freshness in textile linguistics outweighs minor overuse of "woven" metaphor. Emotional nuance feels organic despite occasional lyricism</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively despite density. Brief length enhances mystery. Combines familiar (translation centers) with original (textile mnemonics) in ways that prompt reflection on cultural erasure and transmission</comment>
