<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's "assertively meek" trait is subtly embodied through actions (wiping bar counter with precision, sliding card quietly), and motivations align with her technological frustration. However, her internal transformation feels underdeveloped despite external symbolisms.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight yet fluid; the firework's instant sparks coherent arc from stagnation to digital liberation. Plot maintains logic (card as map, threads as network), though the resolution's abruptness slightly strains believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Desert mirage and tapestry's golden threads create atmospheric tension between decay and hidden potential. Sensory details (heat waves, tactile fabric) anchor the setting, but the "technology dissolving" motif lacks full integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery (tapestry as network, card as "unwritten journey") elevates thematic depth. Some exposition-heavy moments undercut subtlety (e.g., "desperate optimism"), but the ending's philosophical resonance stands out.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids blatant tropes by fusing the tapestry-tech metaphor, though "small-town prison" feels familiar. Writing style avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on vague abstraction ("labyrinthine escape route"). Emotional layers exist but aren't fully excavated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit themes of constraint and liberation. The concise structure amplifies existential stakes. Leaves an evocative question about technology's dual role as oppressor and savior.</comment>
