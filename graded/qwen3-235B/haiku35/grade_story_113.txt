<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character traits like hesitation and "shyly loud" performance style are present but superficially integrated; motivation to unravel sorrow lacks granular emotional grounding despite symbolic use of plush.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Fragmented chronology undermines cohesion; dream-hopping device shortcuts plot progression rather than earning it through character-driven action; abrupt transitions weaken cause/effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Xenon tunnel and collective grief timeframe establish mood but lack sensory specificity; atmosphere leans on poetic abstraction over visceral environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry, fragile time) add depth, but over-reliance on "tell-don't-show" dilutes emotional impact; ending feels intellectually resonant but emotionally remote.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (emotional conduit plush) and formulaic phrasing ("quantum resonance"); avoids major clich√©s but occasionally substitutes ornamentation for nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic unity undercut by uneven execution; elements like the plush and timeframe work synergistically, but underdeveloped plot mechanics and pacing hinder overall success.</comment>
