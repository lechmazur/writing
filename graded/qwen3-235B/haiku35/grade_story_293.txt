<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Primary motivation (escaping conformity) is clear, but emotional underdevelopment leaves her insincerity trait underexplored. Actions align with desire for freedom but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear structure effectively compressed, but the "deploy" action lacks tactical specificity. Emotional climax at window feels abrupt despite strong thematic throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Biological cityscapes create vivid cognitive dissonance between organic decay and technological control. Atmospheric details like bacterial electricity create immersive tension between natural and synthetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Celestial navigation effectively symbolizes pursuit of meaning. Subtext about algorithmic existence vs. cosmic possibility adds philosophical weight. Ending lacks visceral impact despite strong metaphoric resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Evocative setting concepts undercut by familiar escape narrative. Similes like "whisper warnings" verge on clich√©. Some overwriting ("pulsing bacterial boundaries") distracts from genuine emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration mostly coherent but surface-level. Unique aspects like bioluminescent infrastructure create memorable texture that partially compensates for formulaic rebellion tropes.</comment>
