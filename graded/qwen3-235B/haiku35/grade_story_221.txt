<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marina's profession as a wreck-diver ghost whisperer feels underexplored in her active decision-making, though her motivation to transcend generational silence is clear. Internal conflict is well-rendered through symbolic gestures, but her skills as a ghost whisperer lack concrete narrative function beyond metaphorical resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent emotional arc but relies heavily on internal monologue over tangible action to drive progression. The tight word limit sacrifices specific narrative beats, though the connection between the opening amber image and closing stars creates a fragile structural integrity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival's sensory decay—peeling paint, rusted mechanisms—is evocatively rendered, creating a paradoxical atmosphere that mirrors Marina's emotional state. The setting's liminality works symbiotically with her character, though temporal markers beyond "autumn equinox" remain vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (insect in amber, thawing heart) provide thematic cohesion, but emotional resonance leans heavily on stated introspection rather than nuanced subtext. The ending avoids sentimentality but risks abstraction by resolving through internal epiphany alone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some poetic phrases (e.g., "spectral energy flowed through her") verge on ornate abstraction, and the persistent amber metaphor borders on overused. However, the intersection of professional identity (wreck-diver) with familial legacy offers genuine originality within familiar introspective themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>While formally cohesive, the story occasionally prioritizes atmospheric abstraction over narrative momentum. The synthesis of assigned elements is admirable but occasionally feels schematic, with thematic throughlines not fully earned by character action or plot development.</comment>
