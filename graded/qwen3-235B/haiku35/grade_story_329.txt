<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's chess background informs his strategic mindset but motivation remains abstract, relying more on stated compulsion than demonstrated progression. Nuances of xenophobia and obsession lack psychological specificity. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot pivots logically on sensory anomalies leading to discovery, but corridor revelation feels rushed within tight word limit. Beginning-end connection exists but lacks developed consequences. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hydroponic farm establishes sterile, surreal atmosphere through tactile details, but setting's connection to character psychology remains superficial despite metaphorical nods. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective use of chess-as-metaphor and resonant imagery, but thematic depth remains gestural rather than fully embodied. Ending gestures toward transcendence without earned emotional stakes. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lush descriptions occasionally tip into overwritten prose, while plot mechanics (puzzle-key revelation) follow familiar discovery tropes. Xenophobic characterization feels like imposed trait rather than lived reality. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story feels artificially compressed rather than deliberately concise. Assigned elements function but lack organic integration; narrative momentum sacrificed for atmospheric abstraction. </comment>
