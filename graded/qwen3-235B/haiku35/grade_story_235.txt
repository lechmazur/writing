<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While Akira’s motivation is clear and consistent, her internal complexity remains underexplored beyond her obsession, leaving the character compelling but thinly rendered for a demanding literary standard.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong, with the repositioning action driving the narrative, but the compressed arc feels slightly truncated, sacrificing deeper exploration of the celestial-botanical revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, tactile details like “centuries-old walls” and “pressed botanical specimens” create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere, though the castle’s reimagined purpose as an art academy could be more deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich literary devices (botanical imprints as metaphors for ephemeral connections) and a resonant theme of hidden interconnection elevate the narrative, though the ending leans on poetic abstraction over fully earned emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh hybrid concepts (herbalist-astrophysics) avoid clichés, but occasional overreliance on ornate phrasing (“silent narrative waiting to be understood”) occasionally muddles clarity for maximum impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven yet occasionally strained by the tight word limit; the story’s thought-provoking core theme overshadows minor structural compromises but lacks a truly unforgettable twist.</comment>
