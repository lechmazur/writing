<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Crisp motivation for a cosmic heist but lacks emotional depth in characterization; actions align with plot demands more than authentic psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Ambient buildup dominates over coherent progression; the cosmic arc feels implied rather than executed within the constrained scope.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Resonant metaphors present but undercut by uneven emotional engagement; the ending lingers conceptually if narratively unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original concept execution shows ingenuity but occasionally drowns in ornate abstractions; avoids most AI-writing traps while flirting with purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elaborate concept threading occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity; the story works better as poetic exercise than emotionally dynamic fiction.</comment>
