<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually defined but lacks concrete actions/dilemmas revealing depth; motivations exist abstractly but aren't dramatized through meaningful choices; traits like 'awkwardness' and 'hermit crab' analogy remain abstract rather than manifesting in specific, visceral behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot substitutes philosophical musings for narrative progression; key elements like 'final evidence' feel arbitrarily placed rather than organically driving events; static, meditative structure lacks dramatic tension or consequential decisions despite strong atmospheric bookends</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting masterfully combines tactile geological details with thematic duality (cold vs. heat); steam, sword, and postcard integrate sensorially; atmosphere poetically mirrors cultural dissonance; occasionally overwritten but vividly immersive</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (shells, blankness, swords) creates layered meaning; ending revelation feels intellectually elegant but emotionally diffuse; pacing uneven between lyrical passages and underdeveloped concepts; theme of cultural resurrection resonates but execution lacks visceral impact</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original setting/geological imagery contrast with clich√©d similes (hermit crab metaphor overexplained); lyrical language occasionally becomes self-indulgent ('spectral witnesses'); emotional states often stated rather than embodied; tone struggles to balance mythic abstraction and human vulnerability</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story prioritizes thematic density over narrative momentum; all required elements are present but feel forcibly grafted rather than organically integrated (e.g., hermit crab method); ambitious central metaphor partially obscures character specificity; stylistic ambition outpaces emotional resonance</comment>
