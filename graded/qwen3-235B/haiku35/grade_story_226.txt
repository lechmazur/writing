<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by over-reliance on ornate descriptors ("fractured memories," "liminal spaces"); some elements like black-market transactions feel generically inserted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overly contrived element integration prioritizes symbolism over narrative cohesion; ambitious themes resonate faintly but fail to coalesce into lasting impact.</comment>
