<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underexplored; the claustrophobia feels artificially imposed rather than organically tied to her scientific obsession. The "lightly heavyhearted" trait is stated but not embodied through nuanced action or reaction, and the first-person voice would have better revealed internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a descending arc toward discovery, but the jam-tasting method feels gimmicky rather than integral to advancing the action. The floating tea house’s symbolic connection to the climax is tenuous, and the abrupt shift to the bioluminescent encounter lacks layered cause-and-effect buildup within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The submersible’s claustrophobic atmosphere and the tea house’s surrealism create vivid contrasts, but the latter’s purpose remains ambiguous. Sensory details like fogged glasses and creaking wood immerse the reader, yet the setting’s mystical tone occasionally clashes with the clinical focus on marine intelligence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "sentient rhythm," "metallic walls closing in") and the grandmother’s photo add thematic depth, though the ending’s didacticism undercuts subtlety. The tension between scientific rigor and empathy resolves too neatly, but the central theme of connection resonates through the bioluminescent encounter’s ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The jam-tasting anxiety technique is inventive yet borders on whimsical, while the healing touch concept feels overly familiar juxtaposed against cutting-edge science. Some phrasing ("inkiness of the ocean") leans into cliché, and the blend of mysticism and marine biology risks becoming a narrative patchwork rather than a seamless whole.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>The story’s brevity forces compromise: the floating tea house and healing touch concept feel loosely integrated, while the claustrophobia and jam method add texture without becoming narrative anchors. The central tension is compelling but underdeveloped, leaving the ending’s philosophical weight feeling less earned.</comment>
