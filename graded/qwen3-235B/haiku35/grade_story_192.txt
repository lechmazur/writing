<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to find connection in a digital age is clear, but the "eager lookout" trait feels underexplored. Her ruthless kindness lacks nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses cohesively but feels rushed; transitions between analysis and revelation lack full emotional weight. The concept guides the plot but occasionally strains pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges sensory details (dulled marble, creaking wood) with evocative contrasts (tech vs. spirituality). Setting and tone align seamlessly, though some descriptions verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (papyrus bridging time) elevates the narrative, and the ending feels purposeful. Deeper emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on ornate descriptions ("whispers of generations"). The poltergeist method is inventive, though slightly formulaic in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but unevenly weighted—sewing box and motivation shine, while the "wager of faith" feels tacked on. Style enhances theme but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>
