<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's late-blooming heroism and softened militancy are established but lack nuanced emotional development; motivations are clear yet under-explored through introspection or complex action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains logical progression toward the approaching stranger, but the tight word limit leaves the arc feeling unresolved; tension is sustained, yet the ending’s openness undercuts narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic atmosphere is vivid and immersive, blending decay with regeneration; sensory details are evocative but occasionally generalized, slightly diluting the setting’s emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., spyglass as insight tool) and themes of resilience/loss are potent; dialogue and conclusion feel slightly schematic, but imagery elevates emotional resonance and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on familiar post-apocalyptic imagery; prose balances clarity and lyricism but veers toward ornate abstraction in places; character psychology shows nuance without full complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements cohesively, with tone and setting deeply entwined; the brief length serves the narrative’s focus on anticipation, though some thematic threads remain underdeveloped.</comment>
