<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated rather than organically revealed; restlessness and "earnestly deceptive desire" lack nuanced psychological grounding despite atmospheric cues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of tailoring and sci-fi, but flickering lantern trope and adverb-heavy prose verge on clich√©; emotional resonance occasionally sacrificed to ornate description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohere into melancholic whole, though some feel decorative rather than essential; brevity serves contemplative tone but limits narrative stakes.</comment>
