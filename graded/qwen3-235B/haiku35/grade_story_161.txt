<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent (revenge for wife's death driving conspiracy unraveling), but lacks psychological depth beyond vengeance trope; vigilance as orchardist doesn't deeply intersect with investigative methods.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through symbol-as-clue structure, but investigation progression feels condensed; sudden document breakthrough lacks intermediate steps; clear arc but rushed execution within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Effective use of orchard sunset imagery and peacock feather symbolism for thematic resonance, but conspiracy setting remains generic; insufficient sensory integration of volunteer historical society context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical framework (peacock as interconnected deception) elevates narrative; emotional impact present but surface-level; ending lacks satisfying thematic synthesis despite effective code-breaking symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in conspiracy structure but relies on predictable revenge narrative framework; peacock code metaphor is fresh but insufficiently distinguishes story from genre tropes; language avoids purple prose but lacks distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combined cohesively with varying effectiveness; brevity serves tension but limits depth; story maintains consistent style while leaving some thematic potential unrealized; ends with clear momentum rather than full resolution.</comment>
