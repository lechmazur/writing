<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is introspective but lacks external conflict to fully realize motivations; inner obsession with patterns is clear but underdemonstrated through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has compelling momentum but falters in closure; the debris' "communication" lacks narrative payoff, leaving tension unresolved despite effective build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (rustling postcards, orbital decay) but occasionally over-embellished, risking detachment from character-driven immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story creates intellectual resonance via symbolic debris-as-language; metaphors for redemption and perception are strong, though emotional impact is sometimes subdued by abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in cosmic-scale first contact framing; avoids clich√©s through non-verbal alien communication, though occasional ornate phrasing ("branches of redemption") mildly dilutes authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as contemplative sci-fi literary piece but strained by over-packed thematic elements; cohesion is maintained more by tone than structural precision.</comment>
