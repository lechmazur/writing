<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's sorrow is established but underexplored; motivation is clear but emotional depth lacks nuance beyond surface descriptors of "painful joy."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Built around a ticking-clock premise, but pacing feels cramped—key revelations and emotional beats are compressed, weakening narrative payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ethereal setting is vividly sketched but relies on diffuse, mystical shorthand; sensory details are evocative yet inconsistently connected to character experience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors linking food to memory are innovative and thematically resonant, though the ending's resolution feels abrupt rather than cathartic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar "lost wisdom" tropes; overwritten phrases (“desperate preservation”) occasionally undercut the organic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper integration; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful, leaving thematic and emotional arcs underdeveloped.</comment>
