<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fractured identity theme is compelling, but "mathematically challenged" never meaningfully intersects with her memory preservation. Quiet mania remains abstract without visceral behavioral manifestations. Shared baseball language serves as shallow metaphor rather than psychological foundation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lyrical stasis over narrative progression. Fragmented structure mirrors theme but sacrifices dramatic shape—no rising action or emotional arc within the constraints. Thunder's response feels arbitrarily positioned rather than earned through plotted tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-human decay vividly rendered through tactile details (brittle pages, dust motes) and symbolic objects (eroded books). Atmospheric cohesion strained when connecting treehouse specificity to broader existential premise—setting becomes metaphor at expense of physical immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Poetic density occasionally transcends into obscurity ("coax thunder from empty skies"), but recurring motifs (dust, fragmentation) achieve resonant cohesion. Metaphorical layering of stolen memories as preservation rather than theft offers philosophical weight, though some abstractions remain inert.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elegant prose occasionally curdles into aestheticized despair ("testament to accumulated knowledge now rendered meaningless"). Fragmentation concept feels generatively explored rather than formulaic, though dream-thief punishment borders on speculative cliché without deep sociological logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>High-concept elements (dream theft, post-humanism) don't organically fuse with intimate character study. Formal elegance lingers, but narrative remains admirable rather than urgent. Lingering impression favors poetic reverie over existential provocation.</comment>
