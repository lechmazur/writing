<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematically clear but lack psychological depth; Marcus' stage fright is juxtaposed with his determination but doesn't meaningfully shape his actions or create internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed; the key-turn action drives progression, though the tight timeframe strains the emotional weight's full development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details (metallic debris, cold corridors) and metaphorical setting (toys as unfinished narratives); integration of orbital elements occasionally strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphors (exorcism as truth-seeking, toys as symbolic legacies); ending provides thematic satisfaction but risks over-explication of themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptual originality undermined by occasionally flowery, disconnected prose ("spectral remnants of lies"); some atmospheric elements feel contrived rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements combine into a coherent whole but strain under scrutiny; themes resonate while execution occasionally prioritizes poetic abstraction over narrative cohesion.</comment>
