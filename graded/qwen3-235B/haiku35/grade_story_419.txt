<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but underexplored; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through action; "no-nonsense" and "empathic" elements lack nuanced human contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists through thematic continuity but lacks narrative momentum; circular structure prioritizes atmosphere over tangible progression; transitions feel occasionally static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion; the haunted dollhouse museum creates paradoxical intimacy between decay and preservation; setting acts as co-character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (stained glass as memory-fragments) and thematic resonance prevail over conventional plot; ending avoids pat resolution while reinforcing core ideas; poetic cadence occasionally outweighs substance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but contains borderline purple prose ("phantom pulse of forgotten generations"); metaphors remain fresh despite occasional ornateness; emotional resonance emerges through juxtaposition rather than direct exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function interdependently but with minor seams showing; style occasionally prioritizes aesthetic over clarity; concise format serves thematic brevity but limits character/plot evolution.</comment>
