<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marcus displays nervousness through physical gestures but lacks psychological depth. His "kingpin" status feels unearned and inconsistent with low-aggression methods. Motivation against "tyranny of indifference" is abstract rather than personally rooted. The seed pod interaction lacks emotional weight beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The detour provides plot convenience but lacks narrative necessity. Causal logic holds, but the research station discovery feels like a mechanical device to advance the theme. The midwinter setting constrains pacing while the rushed Ironcliff interaction sacrifices emotional payoff. Resolution is implied rather than developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stark midwinter imagery (frost, bare branches) creates visual coherence. The xenophobic enclave's isolation mirrors Marcus's internal tension. Sensory details (rattling pods, crunching gravel) enhance mood, though the town's xenophobia remains stereotypical rather than culturally textured.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective seed symbolism and visual metaphors (blind-eye windows) create resonance. The final gesture of touch offers emotional subtext. However, themes of resistance vs. isolation are communicated through concept rather than earned dramatic tension. Undermined by occasionally clich√©d phrasing ("tyranny of indifference").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but contains formulaic elements - the "outsider reformer" narrative, research station as deus ex machina. Metaphors are serviceable but not revelatory. The phrase "fragile ferocity" repeats twice. Some emotional states are told rather than shown, particularly in the abrupt ending.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements combine logically but lack transformative interplay. The brief length highlights structural efficiency over emotional development. While the theme of quiet resistance emerges, the narrative feels more concept-driven than character- or world-born. Lingering impression comes from setting rather than narrative depth.</comment>
