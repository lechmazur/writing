<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on abstract, ornate prose veers into purple prose; similes and descriptions often prioritize aesthetics over narrative specificity or originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolation; excessive focus on atmospheric abstraction undermines cohesion, leaving story feeling like a fragmented tone poem rather than a unified work.</comment>
