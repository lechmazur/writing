<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies on poetic abstraction over psychological depth; motivations are vaguely stated as artistic pursuit without concrete conflict or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; progression is meditative but feels static, with minimal cause-effect or tension. Pacing emphasizes lyricism over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant sensory immersion in the exo-atmospheric setting enhances tone, though some technical details (e.g., "quantum equations") feel arbitrarily inserted.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and atmospheric prose create visceral impact, though emotional resonance is diluted by abstract, tell-don’t-show poeticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by overly ornate language and metaphors bordering on cliché; occasional "purple prose" detracts from authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in mood and imagery but lacks narrative urgency or thematic complexity; functions better as prose-poetry than a publishable story.</comment>
