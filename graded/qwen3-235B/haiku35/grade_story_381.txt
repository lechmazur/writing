<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characterization leans heavily on descriptors without deep psychological integration; the necromancer aspect feels ornamental rather than foundational to her scientific rigor or decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot exists as a static meditation on discovery rather than dynamic progression; the resolution feels imposed rather than naturally earned through sustained conflict or stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on vivid but superficially rendered contrasts (futuristic vs. spectral); fails to cohere into a unified logic that would make the crystalline cave feel truly alien or transformative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on juxtaposing sci-fi terms ("quantum scanners") with mystical concepts ("spectral echoes") creates novelty without narrative necessity; prose risks becoming a checklist of aesthetic tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Combines ambitious elements without synthesizing them into a unified vision; attempts breadth over depth in ways that dilute emotional resonance.</comment>
