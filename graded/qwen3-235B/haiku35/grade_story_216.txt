<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth in characterization; motivations rely on premise rather than internal conflict. Actions align with profession but lack human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows logical transformation arc, but abrupt midnight call initiation weakens cause-effect flow. Pacing compressed yet coherent within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cloud City's surreal atmosphere enhances thematic resonance, though some details (e.g., metallurgical history) strain immersive logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism and conceptual themes present, but emotional engagement limited by overly stylized prose and lack of interiority in character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by clich√©d elements (midnight calls, encoded messages). Metaphors fresh but occasionally self-indulgent; tone inconsistent shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrate cohesively with slight forced connections. Style serves premise but occasionally obscures clarity; ending resonates conceptually but not emotionally.</comment>
