<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but under-developed in terms of concrete actions that dramatize inner conflict; dialogue and behavior lack distinctiveness despite thematic presence of conscientious objection and quiet observation</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative drifts without clear progression; atmospheric vignettes substitute for plot; beginning/end connection exists through orchard imagery but lacks emotional/structural payoff within constraints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard's sensory details create vivid, haunting atmosphere; environment functions as active character; coy malevolence manifests through precise natural metaphors</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (birds/migration, nail/generational witness) deepen themes; pacing prioritizes contemplation over action; subtext about nonviolent resistance emerges organically; ending resonates as thematic culmination</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical writing occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but avoids AI-style repetition; character psychology feels authentic despite limited interiority; some transitions and details strain credibility but overall maintains unique voice and perspective</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel strategically chosen but unevenly integrated; storm ravine/orchard anchors narrative strongest; family tradition and neighborhood watch appear as underdeveloped context rather than active components</comment>
