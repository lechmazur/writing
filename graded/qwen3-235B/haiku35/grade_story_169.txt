<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinctive traits and clear metaphysical profession, but lacks emotional depth beyond surface-level eccentricity. Motivation blends into abstract conceptualism without revealing personal stakes or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Narrative remains stagnant, cycling around a single action without developing conflict or transformation. Structure lacks progression, resolution, or meaningful stakes within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, but atmospheric elements mostly decorate rather than shape the character's actions or thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant prose and resonant metaphors evoke curiosity about metaphysical themes, but emotional engagement remains intellectualized rather than visceral. Ending achieves poetic symmetry without narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Conceptually bold and stylistically adventurous without rehashing genre tropes. Some overwritten phrases risk pretension, but the fusion of real estate and soul-transfiguration shows authentic creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story survives its tight word count through atmospheric density but struggles to make the assigned elements feel organically interdependent. Premise intrigues, yet coherence remains impressionistic rather than fully realized.</comment>
