<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (breaking generational curses) is conceptually clear but lacks visceral reactions to objects/surroundings; his 'steadily unpredictable' approach feels abstract rather than dramatized through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot leans on symbolic progression (song → revelation) but lacks tangible stakes or conflict within the tight word limit; the emotional arc is felt, but the pacing relies heavily on lyrical repetition rather than structural momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned launch site and rusted imagery evoke decay and ambition’s ruins effectively; atmosphere marries the theme of fractured legacy, though some descriptions border on overwrought metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong emotional subtext through metaphors (e.g., embroidery as excavation), but the ending’s transcendence feels slightly predictable; the central theme of empathy is illuminated but risks abstraction over concrete human nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in merging textiles with incantation, but some phrases (“emotional landscapes,” “radical empathy”) feel stock or academic; the prose occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over functional clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as poetic vignette but loses cohesion edge in balancing high-concept symbolism with intimate character grounding; the brief format serves mood but limits narrative tension.</comment>
