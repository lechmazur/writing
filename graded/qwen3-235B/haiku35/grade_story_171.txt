<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks emotional depth; obsession drives actions but personality is narrowly defined by singular focus, with minimal internal contradictions or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pacing lags in midsection; magical payoff is abrupt, leaving key connections (e.g., bootleg recordings' mechanism) unexplained; structure emphasizes atmosphere over narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich, cohesive atmosphere with tactile details (creaking carnival, eroded sign), though the bicycling-powered setting's thematic link to "reconnection" feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphors and eerie resonance create intrigue, but relies on abstract declarations of significance rather than earned emotional weight; theme of magic through preservation resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by repetitive mystical phrasing ("arcane mysteries") and tonal vagueness; garnet's powers lack concrete rules, veering into AI-style "anything-goes" fantasy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Celebrates creativity within constraints, but cohesion relies too heavily on poetic associations rather than logical integration; memorable imagery elevates otherwise skeletal narrative.</comment>
