<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character lacks nuance beyond "hopeful" & "cleverly naive" labels; motivations align with actions but remain underexplored; voice feels generic, with traits stated rather than vividly demonstrated through specific choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc within constraints, but pacing feels slightly rushed in critical moments; connection between streetlamp's darkness and resolution is thematically strong; concept-machine integration lacks deeper cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually vivid setting with haunting atmosphere created through sensory details, but fails to fully capitalize on the hedge maze's potential for surreal tension; mystical elements remain superficially explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Uses symbolism effectively (jigsaw, machine, frequencies); ending delivers philosophical payoff through showing rather than telling; subtext about pain's meaning resonates; occasional lyrical prose elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but relies on familiar tropes (heroic knight, labyrinthine garden); some passages exhibit AI-esque purple prose ("agonizing bliss that defied rational understanding"); metaphors fresh but unevenly executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative but lack revolutionary synergy; brief length feels like limitation rather than choice; atmospheric strengths compensate for occasional formulaic phrasing; leaves thematic resonance but lacks profound lingering impact.</comment>
