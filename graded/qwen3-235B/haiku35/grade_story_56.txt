<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weakly integrated trauma-to-redemption arc; corporate swindler backstory feels tacked on rather than shaping psychology; characters function more as thematic vessels than fully realized people; limited exploration of how "energetically lethargic" manifests beyond a single phrase</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plotted with surgical precision but lacks tension; all elements dutifully connected yet resolution feels preordained; emotional stakes remain abstract; technical details substitute for organic conflict; pacing efficient but slightly airless</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere vividly rendered through haunting juxtapositions (steel/apple trees), but sensory specificity limited to visual elements; sound ("hummed") and touch (textured book spine) present but smell/taste absent; symbolic weight sometimes overwhelms lived reality</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric structure sustains thematic cohesion; computer reboot as heartbeat metaphor masterfully executed; dialogue transcendent in its conceptual density but risks feeling like idea-expression rather than human speech; ending earns its weight but lacks physiological resonance</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original conceptual blending (data ecology + spirituality of soil) but execution flirts with cli-fi tropes; some phrases ("quiet regeneration") verge on eco-mysticism clich√©s; avoids purple prose through clipped sentences but occasionally sacrifices emotional depth for stylistic austerity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements function with machine-like precision yet feel slightly engineered; length serves thematic conciseness but psychological interiors remain underdeveloped; successfully merges speculative and literary impulses but emotional core remains concept-bound; lingers intellectually rather than viscerally</comment>
