<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Romantic doom is named but not demonstrated; motivations for preservation are clear but lack emotional nuance; keys as symbolic objects occasionally reveal character depth but insufficient psychological complexity in reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels abbreviated; thematic bookends with bell and keys work conceptually; pacing uneven in bridging studio scenes with rebellion; cause-effect between dystopian framework and actions requires more texture.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Contrasting sterile studio with decaying organic memories effectively visceral; bell's sound and tactile keys provide strong sensory anchors; "new star" timeframe metaphor lacks spatial integration; utopia design clich√©s undercut atmospheric originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (keys as memory portals) resonate; thematically explores art's essence but relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than embodied experience; ending's symbolic resonance partially compensates for underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt purple prose but risks machine-generated patterns with excessive alliteration and repetitive "forgotten" motifs; some fresh conceptualizations (utopia-as-dystopia) but emotional beats remain stated rather than earned through character-specific nuances.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit central tension; constrained length sacrifices interiority for metaphor; studio setting feels functional rather than imaginatively expanded; lingering philosophical question about perfection vs imperfection emerges effectively.</comment>
