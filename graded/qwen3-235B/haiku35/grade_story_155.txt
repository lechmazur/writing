<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are mentioned but not deeply integrated into actions; motivations lack emotional depth despite thematic connections to family legacy and temporal power.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses from discovery to cosmic revelation, but transitions between elements feel abrupt; cause-and-effect is implied rather than earned within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., "fractured dome," "pulsing equations") create a vivid, mysterious atmosphere; settings align with the surreal tone but lack deeper functional integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "temporal anchors" and layered imagery add depth; however, the ending's philosophical musings feel underdeveloped, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on stylized prose ("geometric light patterns") that occasionally veers toward abstraction without fully grounding the fantastical elements in emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive enough to maintain intrigue, but the compressed format leaves some concepts (e.g., temporal mechanics) underexplored; the central metaphor feels more poetic than thematically urgent.</comment>
