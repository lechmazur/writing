<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Weakened by underexplored timidity; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through interior struggles. The ruler-as-metaphor dominates at expense of nuanced character psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meandering structure mirrors "drift" but sacrifices tension; cryptic revelations lack concrete stakes. Ritual pacing works in short bursts but strains coherence by endgame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Textures thrive in stone/tapestry contrasts, but overreliance on "pulsing energy" clich√©s cheapens mystical elements. Mundane dog sounds contrast effectively yet superficially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Symbolic transformation of ruler elevates theme; lyrical passages about perception vs reality resonate. Some sentimental overreach diluted emotional punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Struggles to escape occult trope gravity; plastic ruler offers novelty but remains more concept than tangible object. Occasional purple patches ("language older than words") undermine authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>Functional cohesion achieved, but calculated element-checking undermines organic flow. Deeper thematic integration required between "intimately distant" tone and initiation ceremony.</comment>
