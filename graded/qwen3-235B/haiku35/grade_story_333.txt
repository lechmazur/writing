<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve traditions is clear, but actions lack emotional depth beyond stated traits. Internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite thematic context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but feels rushed in connecting storm symbolism to revelation. Pacing uneven in tight word limit, with abrupt momentum shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through sensory details (shifting walls, storm vibrations) that enhance mood and theme. Atmosphere immersive and textured.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective literary devices (e.g., shifting symbols as metaphor) elevate impact, but ending’s emotional resonance is subdued. Subtext present but unevenly weighted.</comment>
