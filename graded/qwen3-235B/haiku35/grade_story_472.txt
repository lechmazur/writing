<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with vivid sensory details (e.g., "mechanical heartbeat"), but the zeppelin library's connection to the narrative's core is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional clich√©d phrases ("liminal space") and over-reliance on descriptive abstraction rather than concrete, humanizing details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but uneven in execution; uses elements like a zeppelin library to create tone, but the story's deeper thematic resonance feels just out of reach.</comment>
