<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is poetic but often feels abstract rather than embodied in actionable behaviors; inner conflict is articulated yet thinly demonstrated through concrete choices</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear progression but struggles with compression â€” the epiphany feels earned yet rushed, with underdeveloped cause-effect between environmental changes and character transformation</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles through chromatic and sensory contrasts (neon vs fog, silence vs fractured music) but occasionally prioritizes aesthetic over functional worldbuilding that could deepen narrative stakes</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (CD as psychological artifact, fireflies as embodied memory) elevates thematic resonance; some passages oscillate between lyrical precision and self-conscious artifice</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic phrasing in setting and metaphor but occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction ("luminescent crooked hope") that risks obscuring emotional authenticity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified parable about courage as fragmented continuity; the allegorical approach occasionally undermines narrative urgency in favor of poetic abstraction</comment>
