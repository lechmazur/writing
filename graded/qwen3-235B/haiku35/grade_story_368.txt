<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Maya's traits are established through reflective prose rather than active choices; motivations feel existential rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression from discovery to revelation lacks intermediate stakes or obstacles; transformation feels abrupt despite atmospheric build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery rich but overwrought; temple's physical details evoke mystery, yet time-frame fluidity and "hungry shadows" lean toward atmospheric clich√©.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "suspended promises") diluted by excessive abstraction; theme of decoding meaning is underlined rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Prose veers into ornate, AI-like repetition ("twisted... serpentine memories"; "waiting for her next revelation"); emotional resonance is stated, not shown through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Element cohesion exists, but story feels engineered to fulfill prompts rather than organically structured; poetic flourishes outweigh narrative conviction.</comment>
