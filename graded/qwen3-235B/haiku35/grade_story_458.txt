<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character has thematic resonance but lacks lived-in complexity; introspective monologue dominates over action-driven development, leaving motivations feeling archetypal rather than human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Static contemplation dominates over plot progression; the coffee stain divination device feels contrived and structurally inert rather than propelling narrative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decaying grandeur of abandoned spaceport juxtaposed with tactile coat button creates potent, cohesive melancholy; sensory details of fractured light and tactile objects ground the ethereal themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (coffee stains as futures) elevate concept, but ending's "uncertain but hopeful" resolution undercuts earlier subtler existential weight; strong atmospheric resonance sustains thematic coherence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on concept-as-trope (coffee fortunetelling, "fractal sorrow") veers into speculative clich√©; purple prose tendencies ("archived millions of narrative fragments") dilute authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Concepts present but unevenly fused; philosophical scaffolding overwhelms character psychology, creating literary museum diorama rather than living narrative.</comment>
