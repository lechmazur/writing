<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Weak motivation consistency; character’s skepticism informs actions superficially but lacks emotional stakes. Voice feels archetypal, not distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by compressed climax; cause-effect logical but pacing uneven. Assigned elements drive structure yet undermine organic development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid yet disjointed sensory details (ink/steam) enhance mood but fail to anchor thematic connections to character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors undercut by overwrought prose; tension between myth and reality hinted but underexplored. Ending feels contrived, not earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack narrative synergy; brevity aids mystery yet sacrifices depth. Lingering questions feel unresolved rather than intentional.</comment>
