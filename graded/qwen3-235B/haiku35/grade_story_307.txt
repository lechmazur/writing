<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characterization as symbolic archetype overshadows psychological realism; motivations are conceptually clear but lack nuanced personal conflicts or inner contradictions that would ground her humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through atmospheric momentum rather than narrative action; tension between entropy and hope exists, but lacks a concrete arc or stakes within the constrained format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion through neon-soaked decay and luminous fragility; setting functions as active character, amplifying thematic resonance with minimal narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphorical density enriches emotional subtext; repetitive phrasing occasionally dilutes impact, but lyrical passages about imperfection as resilience resonate powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visionary tone avoids formulaicity but risks poetic redundancy; some descriptors verge on ornate abstraction, though the scratched DVD and neon communication system demonstrate genuine ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a unified thematic mosaic despite slight narrative inertia; brevity serves as intentional meditation on resistance rather than a structural limitation.</comment>
