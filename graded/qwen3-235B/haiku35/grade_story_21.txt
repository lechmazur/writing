<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's diplomatic persona is inconsistently developed; motivations toward revenge and historical accountability lack psychological depth despite surface-level complexity in internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through static introspection rather than action; narrative cohesion between genetic mystery, setting, and revenge remains fragmented; unclear resolution within constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like "faint scent of must" and "rhythmic drumming" establish mood, but atmospheric elements don't fully integrate with plot or character development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors and imagery (genetic codes as "tapestry") lack freshness; surface-level themes of revenge vs. scientific ethics lack subtextual complexity; emotional impact feels manufactured.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Reliance on tropes ("genetic manipulation," "revenge quest") combined with overly ornate descriptions ("abrasive calm" phrasing) suggest formulaic writing; inconsistent tonal shifts between clinical and melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel artificially inserted rather than organically integrated; fails to transcend genre conventions or provoke lasting reflection despite ambitious thematic scaffolding.</comment>
