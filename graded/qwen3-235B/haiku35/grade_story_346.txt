<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are inconsistently expressed—boastfulness manifests only indirectly through occasional dialogue, not through sustained personality or action; motivation is clear but could be better intertwined with core character traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has rising action and resolution but often prioritizes abstract ideas over clear narrative progression; transitions between moments feel slightly rushed or under-developed in the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly and unnaturally immersive, with sensory details (texture of membranes, neural networks, balloon pops) that deepen theme and mood; atmosphere reflects "intimately impersonal" concept brilliantly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (lint as map, wasp nest as manuscript) creates layered meaning; ending’s philosophical revelation ("escape was about seeing") feels earned and resonant; prose is precise and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original concept executed with ingenuity, but occasional over-reliance on abstract phrasing ("madness of liberation") and slightly formulaic introspection weakens emotional immediacy and distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite complex elements; tone, theme, and metaphors align tightly; brevity enhances urgency; leaves lingering questions about reality’s constructed nature in a way that feels intentional and powerful.</comment>
