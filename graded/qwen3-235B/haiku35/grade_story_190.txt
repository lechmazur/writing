<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivations (empathy mastery, information brokering) are clear but only moderately connected to cautious smuggler identity; "meticulously impulsive" trait is mentioned more than demonstrated through decisive character-defining actions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Self-contained arc with clear progression from infiltration to data acquisition; some compressed transitions (painter's musical memories to water data) feel slightly rushed despite tight word limits</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High-tech sterile atmosphere effectively juxtaposes with organic imagery of butterflies and musical memories; sensory details occasionally generic (humming screens, surgical gowns) rather than visceral</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transcends procedural plot through recurring butterfly motif and subtext about decoding human vulnerability; dialogue minimal but atmospheric elements create lingering resonance</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls; some phrases ("relic from her last dangerous smuggling run") border on clich√©d, but the unique combination of empathy-driven spycraft and musical cartography shows ingenuity</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements present and purposefully utilized; story maintains thematic coherence despite ambitious concept density; leaves nuanced questions about morality of empathy as a tool</comment>
