<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character driven by environmental documentation provides consistency but lacks layered motivations. Whimsical elements hinted at through inventions but not deeply explored. Dialogue reveals some depth, but emotional nuance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Linear progression from temperature readings to impending doom maintains coherence with clear beginning/middle/end. Pacing mostly effective though slight rush in establishing fortune-tellers' roles. Environmental cause-and-effect logically presented but emotional stakes could deepen.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crystal palace melting against stalactites creates vivid, original atmosphere. Sensory details about light and sound enhance immersion. Some aspects of "suspended" geography remain abstract. Practical illusion tone conveyed through juxtaposition of science/mysticism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (mercury as heartbeat, sculptures as civilizational epitaph) elevate narrative. Resonant theme about witness-bearing through art. Emotional impact strong despite minimal character interiority. Ending's archaeological reveal adds meaningful subtext about ephemeral existence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés through imaginative blend of steampunk and climate collapse. Some descriptive phrases trend toward poetic familiarity ("liquid fire") but generally original. Tone remains consistent. Subtle differentiation between "practical illusion" and emotional denial feels human rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious combination of elements. Assigned constraints feel creatively integrated rather than forced. Narrative economy impressive – each detail advances theme/plot. Ending could linger more effectively but leaves strong conceptual resonance.</comment>
