<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character motivations align with traits but lack deeper psychological complexity; "ghostly resolve" feels stated rather than dramatized through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and purposeful but slightly rushed in connecting dares to archive discovery; cause-effect logic holds despite tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through precise sensory details (synthetic wheat's sway, cuneiform etched grain) but underutilizes biodome's thematic potential as a linguistic ark.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cyberpunk and linguistic anthropology avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally veers toward ornate descriptions ("filtered atmosphere") diluting impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of themes with polished prose; falls short of transcendent emotional weight but establishes compelling moral urgency within constraints.</comment>
