<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a rebel guardian is clear, but her internal conflict lacks depth. The fear of being the last guardian is mentioned but not fully embodied through nuanced action or decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but compressed. The storm timeframe creates urgency but feels underdeveloped. The resolution arrives abruptly without earned emotional payoff despite coherent circularity with the sticky note.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective atmospheric details like 'bitter memories' and 'dust motes dancing like spirits' create mood. However, the 'haunted' elements remain surface-level, never fully integrating with Maya's emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uses metaphor ('walls pulse with memories') and symbolism effectively. The ending's thunder-echoes feel contrived. Theme of preservation vs. progress is clear but lacks philosophical complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Contains familiar tropes (hidden family secrets, storm-as-deadline) with minimal subversion. Avoids purple prose but relies on expected imagery ('restless spirits'). Emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are woven together cohesively with logical connections, but lacks transcendent originality. The storm timeline and secret passage create tension, though none of the assigned elements achieve unexpected thematic resonance.</comment>
