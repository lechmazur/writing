<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya has a clear, conflict-driven motivation (academic vindication), and her necromancy is integrated into her scientific pursuit. However, Jake remains underdeveloped—his reactions lack nuance beyond generic "wonder," weakening their dynamic. The concept of merging necromancy with geology is intriguing but underexplored in character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a basic "discover hidden passage" arc with some momentum. The necromantic method logically drives exploration, but the compressed wordcount forces rushed emotional beats (e.g., the ending’s thematic declaration feels abrupt). Cause-and-effect connections exist but lack depth to fully satisfy structural ambitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The crystalline cave’s atmosphere succeeds through vivid sensory details (humming energy, infinity-reflections) and mystical logic. The interplay between natural and supernatural elements creates tension. However, "futuristic nostalgia" is surface-level—relying on movie references rather than deeper thematic synthesis between eras.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of science and the supernatural creates eerie resonance, particularly in Maya’s interactions with ghosts. Weaknesses include explicitly stated themes (“boundaries meant to be crossed”) and Jake’s flat dialogue. The metaphor of crystals as memory-reflectors is striking but inconsistently rendered through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes by fusing necromancy with geological exploration, yet strains credibility—e.g., how Maya draws power from a "long-dead spelunker" without explaining why that ghost specifically aids her. Emotional beats often tell rather than show (“horror,” “resolve”). The baseball cap and movie references feel calculated to imply authenticity rather than organic connections.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story’s blend of archaeology and magic has conceptual promise, but execution leans on familiar binaries (science/mysticism) without interrogating them. The brevity works for atmospheric snapshots but sacrifices thematic complexity—the core conflict between Maya’s methods and academia remains entirely unchallenged within the narrative. Lingering question: Is integration of the past a triumph or a compromise?</comment>
