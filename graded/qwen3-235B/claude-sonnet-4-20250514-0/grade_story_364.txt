<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but remains surface-level; inner conflict is hinted at but not deeply explored, and the "skewed visionary" trait influences action minimally beyond a superficial link to her temporal research.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, with logical cause-effect relationships; pacing is tight but leaves some transitions (e.g., her decision to sketch) feeling slightly underdeveloped despite overall coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (e.g., "light filtered through unstable time") supports mood, but the "silent revolution" and temporal anomalies lack deeper sensory grounding, weakening full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors and subtext (e.g., observational paradox) elevate the narrative; the ending’s thematic resolution feels satisfying, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction that borders on pretentiousness; the core concept is fresh, but phrases like "mundane miracles" risk cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements cohesively in plot-function but unevenly in depth; the brevity enhances its thematic punch but leaves some ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
