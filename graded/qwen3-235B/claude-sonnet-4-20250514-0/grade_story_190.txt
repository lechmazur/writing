<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's traits of being a cautious smuggler are surface-level; motivations tied to mastering empathy feel underdeveloped. Emotional numbness lacks depth beyond surface descriptions, with reactions to the butterfly and confession feeling somewhat arbitrary rather than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure has a clear arc (emotional shift from extraction to self-awareness) but feels compressed. The ending's rain falls into trite symbolism, and the painter's musical memories as a narrative driver strain coherence within the tight word limit, creating disjointed pacing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setting (drought prediction center) is underutilized atmospheric backdrop rather than an active force. Sparse sensory details fail to distinguish the sterile environment as a unique world; the timeframe's constraints aren't meaningfully tied to the setting's function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (butterfly bookkeeping, music as prediction) and layered exploration of empathy's commodification. Some poetic moments elevate the narrative, though heavy-handed contrasts between sterile vs. emotional elements undermine subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in combining empathy smuggling with musical memory, but relies on predictable "emotionless empath" trope. Overly ornate descriptions ("flattening memories into data") verge on purple prose, with occasional logical gaps in character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic thread about emotional extraction exists, but tension between commercial and personal elements feels unresolved. Some assigned elements (e.g., anesthesia method) detract from narrative authenticity, undermining overall impact.</comment>
