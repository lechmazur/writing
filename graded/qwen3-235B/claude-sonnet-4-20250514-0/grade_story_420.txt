<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's internal conflict is well-conveyed through symbolic objects but lacks concrete backstory or nuanced emotional progression; motivations are coherent yet superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative progression from stagnation to inspiration is logical but compressed; the pivotal moment feels rushed despite strong thematic anchor in the fossils' duality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eerie juxtaposition of ancient bones and living tree creates a haunting, resonant atmosphere; sensory details with light/shadow interplay are visceral and deeply thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sophisticated use of metaphor (fossils as transformation, ring as unity-in-fragility) elevates the narrative; poetic prose balances intellect and emotion effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through layered symbolism, but the "artistic epiphany" trope is only moderately subverted; occasional over-reliance on lyrical abstraction risks vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and striking imagery elevate the piece above mediocrity, but its brevity leaves some character/emotional dimensions underdeveloped.</comment>
