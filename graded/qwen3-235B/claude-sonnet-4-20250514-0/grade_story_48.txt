<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth; Kessa’s transition from wanderer to archivist feels underexplored. Dialogue lacks distinct voice differentiation between characters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed; the ending feels abrupt despite thematically appropriate. Pacing leans too heavily on concept over organic progression.</comment>
