<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (defiance against omniscient mind) is clear, but 'blunt heretic' trait feels underdeveloped; internal conflict nuanced but externalized actions缺乏sharpness expected of a 'blunt' protagonist.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from discovery to rebellion, but relies on compressed exposition; pacing falters momentarily during abstract logical battle, though maintains coherence despite word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking juxtaposition of temple decay and mechanical stock ticker creates memorable atmosphere; however, 'anxious elation' tone leans on explicit description rather than visceral sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (doubt as 'virus') and paradox-as-weapon concept elevate tension; conclusion resonates thematically, though emotional weight could benefit from deeper subtextual complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unique fusion of theological and technological concepts avoids genre clichés; occasional ornate phrasing ("logical vulnerabilities in the divine consciousness") slightly undermines narrative immediacy, but demonstrates authorial voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively synthesizes all required elements; some elements (stock ticker) strain plausibility slightly, but thematic unity and conceptual ambition justify structural compromises.</comment>
