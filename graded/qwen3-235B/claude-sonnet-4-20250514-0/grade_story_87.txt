<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is rich but inconsistent; Cordelia's "hyperactively serene" quality lacks full integration into her emotional arc. Motivations are clear but transformation feels slightly rushed without deeper exploration of psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with strong internal logic, though pacing slightly falters in conveying emotional transitions. The arc resolves effectively but could deepen closure through subtle callback to earlier imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere dazzles with steampunk sensuality, though some descriptions verge on ornamental excess. Sensory details immerse the reader, but the setting occasionally overwhelms character introspection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Potent emotional resonance emerges through layered metaphors and taut subtext. The ending achieves thematic clarity without heaviness, though the theme of "hollow victory" could gain complexity through ambiguous closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in genre fusion but contains moments of formulaic phrasing ("steam hissed through brass pipes"). Avoids clich√©s in subtext but occasionally indulges in melodramatic contrast between mechanical and organic symbols.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Elements synthesize cohesively into a thematically rich whole. Technical skill is evident, but minor lapses in emotional gradation and setting integration prevent full mastery. Lingers thoughtfully in memory.</comment>
