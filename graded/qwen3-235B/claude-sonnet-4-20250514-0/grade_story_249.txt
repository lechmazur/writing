<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's lazily ambitious nature lacks nuance; motivations shift abruptly without sufficient internal logic. Dialogue feels performative rather than revealing true psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels compressed; the beginning/end connection works conceptually, though pivotal moments (e.g., Mrs. Chen's trust) lack earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rain-fountains motif creates atmosphere but setting remains abstract. Sensory details (marble texture, humidity) underutilized to ground the abstract concept of decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery of suspended raindrops and cultural survival symbolism offer intellectual resonance. Overreliance on "tapestry" metaphor weakens otherwise poetic subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in vigilante-gamer duality undercut by predictable "wise elder with treasures" trope. Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction without earned poetic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Elements coexist more than cohere; the brevity forces thematic compression but dilutes character psychology and contextual realism.</comment>
