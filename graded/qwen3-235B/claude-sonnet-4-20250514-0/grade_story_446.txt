<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation toward restoration lacks emotional complexity; "peaceful anger" remains abstract rather than driving tangible decisions. Assigned traits (gambling, obsession) inconsistently shape behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but falters in pacing: the charity drive framing is underutilized, weakening temporal coherence. Revelation about unbecoming feels rushed despite lyrical buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fireflies and breeding grounds offer vivid imagery but fail to integrate meaningfully with the ledger's financial decay theme. Sensory details are beautiful yet generic; setting remains atmospheric prop rather than narrative participant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical parallels (hydrolysis, petals) create thematic resonance, while phrases like "peaceful anger" occasionally veer into abstraction. Ending achieves emotional payoff but relies overly on explicit thematic declarations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric originality (hydrolysis as societal collapse) elevated by firefly-number synesthesia. However, "peaceful anger" and flower-petal fatalism echo predictable existential tropes; avoids complete formulaism through precise, unromantic imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists thematically but not structurally â€“ elements function as symbolic counterpoint rather than organic components. The "letting go to rebuild" theme lingers, but execution remains too reliant on exposition.</(comment>
