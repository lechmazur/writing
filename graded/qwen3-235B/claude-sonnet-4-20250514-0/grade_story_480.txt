<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's role as "social media exorcist" is conceptually engaging but motivation remains surface-level; reactions to objects/concepts feel performative rather than psychologically nuanced, with inconsistent emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows ritual structure but lacks clear conflict/resolution arc; the prescribed action drives the narrative yet feels static, with ending arriving through thematic repetition rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned spaces and candlelit rituals create vivid decayed-chic atmosphere; some sensory details (smoke, crinkling receipt) immerse readers, but psychological atmosphere lacks equivalent depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical imagery (burning receipt as digital purging) but struggles with tonal duality between irony and sincerity; ending provokes reflection on artificial authenticity but feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but treads familiar territory with ironic detachment tropes; writing style is purposeful yet occasionally veers into over-conceptualizing ("digital demons") without fully interrogating human contradictions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically in a conceptual framework but narrative weight feels unevenly distributed; tone remains compellingly ambiguous about its critique of performative authenticity.</comment>
