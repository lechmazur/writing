<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's cyber-templar identity drives the plot, but lacks depth—his rapid transformation feels abrupt despite symbolic gestures. His "patiently frantic" motivation is implied via neural urgency but remains under-explained, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing struggles in the word limit: internal conflict with the Order is established, but the resolution (reflecting lightning) feels rushed. Cause/effect between code-revelations and actions is logical but underdeveloped, with some jarring shifts between introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive—the storm as data clusters and bones humming with ancient power create vivid contrast between tech and tradition. Sensory details (crackling leather, blood mixing with code) are evocative, though the setting occasionally feels like a backdrop rather than an active force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of duality and transcendence emerge powerfully through layered metaphors (bridle/prism, flesh/code) and poetic imagery. The ending is thematically resonant, though some heavy symbolism risks over-explanation. Overall, skillfully "shows" rather than tells.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While the story avoids genre clichés in structure, phrases like "divine madness" and "electric voice of the storm" verge on melodrama. Emotional reactions lean on descriptors ("euphoric agitation") without nuance, and the cyborg-monk trope feels familiar despite the unique setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Despite its ambitious themes and rich imagery, the story occasionally prioritizes style over cohesion. The assigned elements are integrated with varying success, and while the ending provokes reflection, the tight word limit leaves some threads unresolved.</comment>
