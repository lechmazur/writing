<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (ascension via broken codes) is vaguely linked to his role as a tailor—stitching reality is conceptually inventive but lacks emotional grounding in specific tailoring acts. The "nostalgic" trait fades beyond initial setup, and the transition from tailor to reality-weaver feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (mirror confrontation → confession → ascension), but the "last code broken" inciting incident is backstory rather than dramatized event. Pacing leans on storm metaphors to mask rushed thematic shifts; the connection between tailoring and transcendence remains under-explicated despite high-concept payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Storm-enhanced steampunk setting is atmospheric but generic—gears, copper, steam dominate without fresh sensory specifics (e.g., smell of ozone, tactile grit of fabric). The mirror’s visual prominence as a liminal object works, but deeper integration of "broken codes" into environmental details would strengthen cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evokes mood through lyrical prose ("threads of reality," "mortal coils") and the mirror's duality motif, but emotional resonance is attenuated by over-reliance on abstract concepts. The ending’s transcendence feels narratively complete yet thematically shallow—aesthetic surface over philosophical substance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic markers but leans on steampunk/portal fantasy tropes (dusty mirrors, lightning-struck ascension). The "menace beneath reassurance" adds nuance, while the fusion of tailoring and metaphysics offers modest originality. Some purple prose ("desperate hope of a tailor...") mars otherwise distinctive phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (codes as metaphysical constraints, mirror as bridge) but unevenly in execution. The steampunk aesthetic and parallel lives premise elevate it above average genre work, but the brevity sacrifices character depth and thematic nuance. Lingering questions about "what ascension costs" suggest untapped potential.</comment>
