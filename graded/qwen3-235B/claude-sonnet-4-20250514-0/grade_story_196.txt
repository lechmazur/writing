<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character development is competent but compressed; motivations shift abruptly without sufficient groundwork for the dramatic transformation. Dialogue lacks distinctiveness despite thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear plot arc but revelation about the meteors feels rushed. Pacing balances brevity and momentum but lacks nuance in connecting cause/effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich but underutilizes tactile/sensory details. Setting enhances tone but doesn’t actively shape character decisions beyond visual symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of meteors and layered themes of hope/resignation. Ending achieves thematic resonance, but emotional depth sacrificed by brevity; relies too heavily on explicit emotional labels.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with the "guidance vs. threat" twist. Stylistic clarity avoids purple prose, but character psychology edges toward mechanical logic rather than human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive concept execution but constrained by format limitations. Strong central idea diluted by insufficient space for character nuance and worldbuilding expansion.</comment>
