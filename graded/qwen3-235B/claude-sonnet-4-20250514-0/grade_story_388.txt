<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Growth is implied through metaphor rather than shown action. Elena’s motivations exist but aren’t deeply interrogated or complicated. Passive realization weakens emotional engagement despite consistent traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc but strained pacing; key moments (Guardian’s arrival, revelation) feel sudden rather than earned. Logical flow intact but sacrifices depth for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal setting rendered through sensory precision (e.g., "morning mist and spider silk") enhances theme. Slightly generic forest tropes undercut originality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid imagery ("crystalline song") and subtext about silence-as-canvas resonate. Dialogue is purposeful but occasionally didactic. Ending transcends the literal to touch the philosophical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose avoids overt clichés but treads familiar ground (block-to-revelation arc). Subtle sensory work elevates; some elements (forest guardian) lean on archetypes with slight twists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack distinctive authorial fingerprint. Memorable concept sacrificed to conventional structure. Leaves no permanent mark despite thematic ambition.</comment>
