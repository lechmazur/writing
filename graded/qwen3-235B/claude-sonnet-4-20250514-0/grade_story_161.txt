<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Revenge motivation is consistent, but transition from trauma to meticulous schemer lacks emotional depth; the seal as a physicalized family legacy slightly enriches but doesn't fully unlock character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flight demonstration drives plot effectively, but the crucial revelation relies on implausible data visualization; the 500-word frame strains cause/effect logic between volunteer period and orchestrated exposure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sterile facility contrasts nicely with agrarian backstory, but sensory details are skimmed; the peacock planes' visual splendor anchors atmosphere while deeper environmental texture remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical tail patterns as evidence, family crest symbolism, and ironic narrative voice elevate the concept beyond genre tropes; some emotional beats lean on descriptive shortcuts ("vindictive joy") rather than earned tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual method (aerodynamics as conspiracy vehicle) and specific details; structural transitions are smooth but occasionally oversimplified, particularly in financial linkage mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imaginative premise and metaphorical execution compensate for slightly underexplored psychological terrain; the tight focus on revenge maintains cohesion but restricts thematic expansiveness.</comment>
