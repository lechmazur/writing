<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is present but occasionally stated rather than dramatized; motivations are clear but require more nuanced exploration through concrete actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a logical progression but feels compressed; connections between elements are coherent, though the brevity leaves some transitions feeling abrupt despite clever thematic bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting creates immersive atmosphere through tangible details like "vine-strangled shelves" and flickering light, though some sensory aspects remain underdeveloped (e.g., smell, touch).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and thematic resonance, but abstract phrasing in the climax ("memory cycles") risks reducing emotional impact; ending lacks concrete consequences of Elena's revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with the anachronistic device and consciousness-as-solar-chart concept; occasional flourishes ("careful wildness") border on cliché, but the fusion of science/myth retains freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively but unevenly—cellphone and library are masterstrokes, while thematic elements (timeframe, solar cycles) require tighter integration; ambitious themes outpace the tight word limit.</comment>
