<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; Kira's traits are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or nuanced interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is conceptually cohesive but rushed in pivotal moments; the zeppelinâ€™s transformation into a broadcasting station feels underdeveloped despite strong initial momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere excels in descriptions (corroded zeppelin, surreal currents) but struggles to connect the ghost costume and "radio static" timeframe to deeper symbolic or narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtle use of metaphor (e.g., "ripples through dark water") and thematic tension between comfort/truth resonate intellectually, though the ending leans on abstraction over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in fusion of ghostly imagery and multidimensional communication but falters in over-reliant phrases ("calm frenzy") and a schematic structure that feels calculated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ideas drive the story more than character or plot; assigned elements are competently integrated but often serve as conceptual scaffolding rather than organic narrative components.</comment>
