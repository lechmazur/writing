<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks depth; compassion drives action yet feels archetypal. Reactions to the bear imply empathy but don't explore internal conflicts beyond surface heroism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot resolves cleanly within tight limits, but stakes remain abstract. The beginning-end connection works, though the middle lacks escalation despite coherent cause-effect. Pacing feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ethereal setting is vividly rendered with sensory-rich descriptions (e.g., "aurora patterns," "data streams"), though some elements like "alien frequencies" remain underutilized atmospheric tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses strong poetic language and symbolic motifs (bear as childhood, auroras as liberation), but emotional impact is diluted by abstract character dynamics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Combines digital wizardry with inventive metaphysics, but falls into familiar "noble rescuer" tropes. Some imagery (neutron star matter, pixel-flesh avatars) pushes beyond formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Satisfies all requirements cohesively with distinctive voice, though lacks lasting resonance expected at prestigious publication level. Stylistic ambition outpaces emotional or philosophical depth.</comment>
