<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; the blacksmith's internal conflict between freedom and loss is hinted at, but his connection to the sculpture lacks emotional depth. Maya's dialogue feels authentic yet limited in revealing her full internal world.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but slightly rushed; the transition from arrival at the station to the sculpture moment feels abrupt. The beginning-end connection via the flag is effective, but the plot's emotional climax lacks sufficient buildup within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ozone station's toxic atmosphere and the flag's decay create vivid sensory immersion. However, the "professionally wild" description of Dr. Chen is underutilized as a sensory or symbolic element despite its atmospheric potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sculpture as transcendent art serves as a strong emotional throughline. Metaphors (paddleboarding = resilience) and the final image of the flag fluttering work well, but the overt thematic statements about freedom undercut subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s: "audacious meekness" feels fresh, the quarantine isn't reduced to pandemic tropes, and the blacksmith's skill ties meaningfully to survival. However, the "child with wisdom beyond years" trope risks predictability despite nuanced execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The elements create cohesion but often function as thematic anchors rather than organic components. The ending lingers emotionally but the brevity prevents deeper exploration of the "different abundance" concept.</comment>
