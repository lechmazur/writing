<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but underdeveloped; her "feral sky nomad" identity relies more on aesthetic description than embodied behavior. While her actions serve the concept, there's insufficient emotional grounding to make her archivist transformation fully resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a logical arc, but relies on conceptual momentum rather than dramatic stakes. Pacing is efficient but occasionally sacrifices organic progression—her sudden breakthrough with the invisible ink feels underearned despite strong atmospheric setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery is consistently vivid (ink residue as "frozen sheet music") and thematically resonant. Sensory details (humming machinery, falling leaf's sound) create a haunting, tangible world. Weaknesses: Minimal exploration of how "vanishing stars" timeframe connects to the setting's deeper mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (songs as chemical reactions, tradition as invisible ink) are conceptually rich but occasionally over-explained. The ending's "complicated satisfaction" gesture lacks emotional depth despite elegant phrasing. Theme of preservation is clear but doesn't fully transcend the surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise and poetic phrasing counteract occasional stylistic flourishes ("blithe discontent for conventional methods"). Avoids overt tropes but struggles with balancing poetic precision against emotional specificity—some passages risk becoming a checklist of literary devices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are conceptually integrated but unevenly weighted—setting dominates over character depth. The terminal length works but leaves thematic threads (nomadic identity vs. technological preservation) under-explored. Lingering impression is atmospheric rather than transformative.</comment>
