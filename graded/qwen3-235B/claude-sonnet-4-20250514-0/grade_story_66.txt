<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is thematically present but lacks emotional depth; actions align with assigned traits but remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence despite tight word count, though the arc feels compressed; puzzle-as-metaphor works thematically but risks schematic rigidity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere conveys liminality effectively; the greenhouse's decayed beauty deepens both setting and character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (masks, puzzles) carry thematic heft; ending resonates conceptually but lacks visceral emotional payoff for character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional overwrought phrasing ("carbonize more samples"); avoids overt tropes but sometimes substitutes poetics for narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohere into a contemplative whole, though some feel curated rather than organically grown; lingers thoughtfully but lacks teeth.</comment>
