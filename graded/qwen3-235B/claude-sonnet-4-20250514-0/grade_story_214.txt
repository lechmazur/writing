<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nuanced vengeance motive clearly shaped by loss, but emotional depth occasionally leans on generic phrases like "black hole of doubt" without deeper psychological exploration. The talisman's role connects past/present but could further reveal character through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concise beginning-middle-end structure with decoding arc, but pacing hiccups when transitioning from cosmic atmosphere to data analysis. Logical cause-effect between stolen archives and corporate downfall established, though motivation/resolution compression occurs within tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Black hole lensing creating color shifts masterfully mirrors psychological transformation, and the "silently audible" hum establishes sensory immersion. However, the "weathered green surface" description feels underspecified compared to space setting's richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like light capture by gravity succeed metaphorically, but tonal whiplash between "rebirth" epiphany and gritty sabotage undermines thematic consistency. Ending lacks ambiguity - needs lingering resonance beyond revenge completion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids space pirate tropes through sea-glass microfilm twist, but the "quintessential victim-turned-avenger" arc follows somewhat predictable emotional beats. Some overwritten descriptors ("aurora-like phenomena") contrast with otherwise lean prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into satisfying if not transcendent whole; brief format compresses rather than illuminates character transformation. The interplay between cosmic grandeur and microfilm espionage demonstrates conceptual ingenuity despite familiar archetypes.</comment>
