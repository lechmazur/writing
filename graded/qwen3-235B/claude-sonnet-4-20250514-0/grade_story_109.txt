<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's cold nature is stated but underexplored; motivation for rebellion is clear but lacks nuanced human contradictions in his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is logical but feels compressedâ€”resolution arrives too abruptly without deep emotional payoff for the setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative details (brutalist facade, winter cold) but lacks depth; setting feels like a schematic backdrop rather than a lived-in world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storytelling uses symbolism effectively (mittens, altars) and introduces a unique blend of magic-realist and spy motifs, but dialogue and introspection feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characters and setting lean on genre tropes (suffering sister, secret agent); folk remedy theme is original but occasionally overexplained rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transformative depth; the short form works but doesn't fully exploit the tension between modern bureaucracy and ancient traditions.</comment>
