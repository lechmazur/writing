<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (soul reconciliation) connect superficially to his crossword-creator identity, which isn't fully integrated into actions/decisions. Lacks layered psychological nuance; motivation stated more than demonstrated through organic behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc but rushes emotional/paranormal consequences. Rewriting diaries as a method lacks procedural logic; cause-effect between edits and spiritual release feels abstract rather than earned through narrative beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on predictable gothic tropes (abandoned libraries, shimmering energy) without unique sensory grounding. "Whisper collection point" and brass keys have symbolic presence but underutilized spatial/diegetic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of redemption through editorial intervention show conceptual ambition, but execution leans on abstractions ("noble chaos") rather than embodied metaphor. Emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on declarative statements over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Originality undermined by clich√©d elements (redemptive forgiveness, light/shadow contrasts) and ornate phrasing ("noble chaos," "retroactive forgiveness"). Psychological realism sacrificed for poetic abstraction, bordering on sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements marginally cohere through shared thematic language but lack alchemical synthesis. Style oscillates between mythic and clinical tones; word count constraints expose underdeveloped mechanics of soul-liberation premise.</comment>
