<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are evident but thinly developed; Marcus's weariness and Elena's resolve lack visceral nuance despite their symbolic roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed, sacrificing emotional payoff; the circularity of the narrative arc works within the word limit but feels slightly forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting details (disguise room, barbells) create a vivid dreamscape, but the timeframe ("hush") is underexploited in shaping temporal atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (barbells as shattered ego) elevates the story; the quiet finality of the parting lingers, though dialogue occasionally veers toward aphorism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes, but "spiritually material" and "fantasy practicality" lean on abstract diction; themes feel slightly overdetermined rather than organically explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherence is achieved through tight thematic linkage, though some elements (hiking trail's role in the dimensional logic) feel perfunctorily explained.</comment>
