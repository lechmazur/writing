<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's phobia and motivation are established, but psychological depth remains superficial. Transformation feels abrupt despite effective symbolic resolution through knot-untying.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity through garage sale obsession leading to desert discovery. Twists feel earned, though pyramid sequence's pacing occasionally bogs down in descriptive weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of claustrophobic wonder created through oppressive desert heat and whispering echoes works well, but sensory details occasionally veer into abstraction rather than visceral concreteness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (knots as fear, net as temporal prison) resonate thematically. Final image of rope-as-liberation provides satisfying emotional pivot that rewards prior tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Occasional overqualified phrases ("mundanely spiritual persistence") and uneven emotional beats suggest partial formulaic influence, though overall originality of the ancient net concept shines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Cohesion exists between elements, but feels more assembled than organically grown. Lingering resonance comes from thematic ambition rather than fully realized synthesis.</comment>
