<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are consistent but lack complexity; Mira's apathy-to-determination arc is clear but underdeveloped. The "enthusiastic apathy" paradox is hinted but not fully explored through actions or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure has clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing struggles under word constraints—hacking sequences feel rushed. The connection between lavender discovery and archival obsession is logical but could use tighter cause-effect transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid sensory details (salt-crusted machines, metallic brine scent) and atmospheric decay. The setting's post-tsunami desolation powerfully enhances both tone and Mira's isolation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("newborn galaxy," "stolen fire") and layered themes about ecological loss. Ending lacks emotional resonance despite poetic language; the core theme of forbidden knowledge's redemptive potential feels under-explicated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh post-apocalyptic imagery avoids most clichés, though "methodically random" feels forced. Avoids purple prose but occasionally over-explains emotions (e.g., "satisfied exhaustion"). Unique handling of forbidden knowledge trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but inconsistently weighted—lavender and archives feel essential while the "methodically random" quality seems performative. Length limitation exposes some narrative thinness in exposition.</comment>
