<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Thornwick’s obsession is clear and consistent, but motivations remain rooted in a simplified mad scientist trope without psychological depth. Betrayals are stated, not explored, and reactions to plants feel functional rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from Thornwick’s preparations to spectral manifestation, but the 500-word arc feels compressed. Beginning/end connect through his cyclical betrayal pattern, though pacing risks underdeveloped beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tea house’s rattling windows and altitude-drunk patrons evoke isolation, but few details (wind whispers, ionized air) directly enhance the core concept. Atmosphere leans on genre tropes more than specific, integrated sensory choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective for atmospheric flair—metaphors like “funeral director” contrast with absurdity—but limited emotional resonance. The central conflict (obsession vs. morality) remains surface-level. Ending’s circularity underscores a clear but unambitious theme of isolation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés with interdimensional plants and film-reel mechanics, but the mad scientist’s one-dimensionality and overly ornate descriptions (“altitude-drunk climbers”) threaten authenticity. Metaphors are vivid without breaking molds.</comment>
