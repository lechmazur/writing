<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's poetic voice and insomnia are established but underdeveloped; her transition to action feels abrupt without deeper psychological exploration, though her non-violence motivation aligns with the story's resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression but lacks tension; the subway timeframe structurally anchors the story, yet the climax relies on plot convenience (drunken confessions) without exploring obstacles to her plan.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (grimy windows, attic dust) create mood, but the "haunted" element isn't fully integrated beyond exposition—the corporate setting and botanical motifs could have been more atmospherically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (whispers as memory, pressed petals as protest) elevate the theme; the ending resonates thematically but feels slightly underdeveloped despite strong lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on familiar tropes (drunken villain monologues); poetic imagery is vivid, but the non-violence arc and corporate villains lack complexity, bordering on didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements serve the plot but aren't all essential; the subway timeframe and botanical samples strengthen cohesion, while the "haunted" aspect and drunken confessions feel imposed rather than organic.</comment>
