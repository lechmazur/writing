<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Marina's dual identity as a plant whisperer and physicist adds intrigue but lacks depth in internal conflict; her decisive action against Valdez feels underdeveloped despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The plot hinges on a climactic moral choice, but the tight word limit flattens the revelation's impact; pacing falters in conveying the gradual emotional weight of the plants' suffering.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The workshop’s vivid industrial decay and the machines’ “stolen whispers” create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details like “copper pipe” and “broken-string melody” immerse readers in the moral ambivalence of the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (machines as “metal gods,” plants as batteries) are striking, but the ending’s moral clarity undercuts the intriguing ambiguity of exploiting life for progress; dialogue leans overly expository.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction over concrete character psychology; phrases like “symphony of stolen whispers” border on melodrama yet retain freshness compared to genre norms.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ideas about ethical compromise resonate, but the narrow focus on plot mechanics limits deeper thematic exploration; its brevity feels structural rather than deliberate, leaving emotional stakes underexploited.</comment>
