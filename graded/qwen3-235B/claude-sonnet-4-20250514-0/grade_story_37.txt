<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Backstory as con artist is underexplored; transformation feels abrupt rather than earned. While his voice has flair, his core motivation (preservation vs. redemption) remains blurred.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Waiting room framing provides structure but detour/diagnosis mechanics feel contrived. Pacing drags in philosophical interiority while crucial ritual details arrive too late for full cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Eclectic setting mashup (rainforest/alpine) lacks integration - cultural dissonance undermines atmosphere. Minimal sensory detail beyond "concrete canopy" and yodeling's echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Yodeling sequence creates haunting emotional resonance. Some telling rather than showing in revelation scenes, but the meta-commentary on deception as preservation works effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("silence stretched like a held breath"), but fusion of alpine yodeling tradition with treetop culture shows ingenuity. Emotional arcs rely too heavily on explication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Cohesion exists thematically but feels forced - elements like city detour serve plot mechanics more than meaning. The metaphorical/metaphorical fire duality intrigues but requires deeper excavation.</comment>
