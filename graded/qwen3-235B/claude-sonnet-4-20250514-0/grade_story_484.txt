<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation (rebellion through brewing) but flat characterization beyond determined brewer trope. Internal conflict underdeveloped; voice lacks consistent idiosyncrasy despite brief first-person elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear progression with logical cause/effect (mirror leads to staircase leads to brewing), but lacks tension or meaningful obstacles. Arc feels compressed rather than fully realized within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory detail in descriptions (rotting flowers, creaking wood) but atmospheric elements like darkness feel symbolic to the point of abstraction rather than visceral dread or thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose (ale as revolution, darkness as societal decay) creates memorable imagery, though emotional weight diluted by occasionally hollow declarative statements about "defiance" and "craft."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (haunted breweries, rebellion narratives) through fermentation symbolism, but some phrasing ("liquid poetry," "malevolent shadows") veers toward familiar fantasy/humanist tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function together to create cohesive political/horror brew, though compression costs depth. Ending lingers intellectually but lacks emotional stickiness from over-explaining themes rather than embodying them.</comment>
