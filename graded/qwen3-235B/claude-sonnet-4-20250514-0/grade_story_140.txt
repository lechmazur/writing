<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is emotionally resonant but somewhat simplistic; Marcus’s transition from guilt to release feels compressed and relies on narrative assertion rather than fully realized internal shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is undermined by abrupt causal connections—e.g., the planetarium show triggering Marcus’s transformation feels imposed rather than organically earned within the limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lush imagery in the abandoned circus and cosmic contrast of the planetarium enhance atmosphere, but overreliance on visual details neglects other senses, limiting full sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of the doll and cosmos creates emotional resonance; the ending’s thematic pivot to embracing the unknown is poignant, though some “tell, don’t show” lingers in grief portrayal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt predictability or cliché; the doll’s uncanny energy and juxtaposition of circus/planetarium offer fresh subtext; purple prose occasionally distracts but doesn’t dominate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesion among elements is uneven—some, like the doll and setting, anchor the narrative, but the planetarium’s role feels tacked-on. The story’s thematic ambition outpaces its execution.</comment>
