<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya and Marcus display purposeful actions but lack emotional depth; their motivations are explicit but underexplored. The thematic use of their assigned traits connects to the rebellion’s goals but relies on implied rather than demonstrated internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective three-act structure within constraints, with cause-effect clarity. The chessboard drives key dialogue, but the cooking-class opening feels disconnected. Pacing balances tension but sacrifices some setup for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details anchor the grotto’s supernatural qualities. Shadows and starfire create an immersive atmosphere that mirrors the rebellion’s defiant tone, though the mundane cooking-class framing clashes with the fantastical setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (chessboard, radio voices) create thematic resonance. The ending’s symbolic weight and “every voice” motif deliver emotional impact, though some themes are stated didactically rather than subtextually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of rebellion and domestic normalcy, but the cooking-class premise strains believability. Avoids overt clichés with unique imagery, though some descriptors (“living shadows,” “intricately simple”) verge on poetic abstraction over concrete meaning.</comment>
