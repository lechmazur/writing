<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's grief and gift are integral to her characterization, but her professional background feels underexplored. The flower crown and ghost interactions effectively reveal her emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compact structure works within constraints, but the rush from elevator malfunction to crisis resolution feels schematic. The thematic arc is clear but somewhat mechanistic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Moisture-starved sand castles in a preservation lab create a haunting juxtaposition. Sensory details (scattered petals, dripping water) and tactile descriptions of machinery create an immersive, melancholic atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Thematic interplay of preservation vs release gains depth through symbolic objects. The final gesture with petals carries significant emotional weight. Subtext about mourning and legacy resonates beyond literal action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality emerges through blending scientific preservation with supernatural elements. Avoids cliche in ghost portrayal, though "elegantly clumsy" occasionally reads as self-consciously poetic rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</level><comment>Seamlessly integrates multiple assigned elements while maintaining thematic unity. The story's brevity doesn't feel forced but rather functions as a contained emotional journey rather than structural limitation.</comment>
