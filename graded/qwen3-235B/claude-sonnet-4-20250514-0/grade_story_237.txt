<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is mostly clear but the "proudly humble" trait feels underexplored. Zara's psychic connection to diaries reveals depth, but her interactions with captors lack emotional nuance for full consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but slightly rushed. The dice-rolling action effectively drives the climax, and the beginning/end connection (last star fading) is strong, but some cause-effect transitions require slightly more narrative groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The atmosphere blends cosmic decay (fading star) with the sterile menace of the brig and ghostly bullet trains. Sensory details are evocative but sparse, leaving some potential for atmospheric immersion unfulfilled.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor (dice as hidden possibilities) and subtext (destiny as collective human story). The ending subverts expectation, though some "telling" (e.g., "heartbreak alarm bells") weakens "show, don't tell" execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally leans on abstract phrasing ("cosmic puzzle pieces"). Originality shines in the bullet trains as story-vessels, but some descriptors (e.g., "endless morning") border on overused poeticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like the chipped die and psychic genealogist are tightly integrated, but the pirate ship's role feels somewhat utilitarian. The theme of destiny-as-healing lingers effectively, though brevity slightly constrains emotional depth.</comment>
