<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s motivation exists but remains abstract; emotional depth is suggested through reflection but lacks grounding in specific history or personality beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on internal epiphany over action; progression through the house of mirrors feels static rather than driven, with cause-effect logic leaning heavily on metaphor over narrative mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich in sensory detail (rust, light, sound) and decay’s symbolism; however, the carnival setting leans on tropes of desolation without adding fresh perspective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery (shattered light, stained glass duality) and thematic cohesion on courage vs. fear; emotional resonance remains somewhat distant despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Opening risks cliche (“town-weary traveler”), but metaphors like the sign’s tapping as a heartbeat avoid full predictability; tone occasionally veers into baroque phrasing without sufficient payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elegantly atmospheric but more a mood piece than a fully fleshed narrative; elements serve symbolism over organic cohesion, making the whole feel curated rather than inevitable.</comment>
