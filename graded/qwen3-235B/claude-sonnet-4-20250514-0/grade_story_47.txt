<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Mira’s transition from “dutiful ward” to power-hungry replacement relies too heavily on stated traits rather than nuance. Her “eagerly jaded” voice lacks emotional depth, and her actions (e.g., stealing phones) feel more plot-convenient than organically tied to her established traits. The final transformation lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but rushed; the cause-effect chain (glove discovery → voice absorption) hinges on unexplained supernatural rules. Pacing compresses pivotal moments (e.g., Corvina’s defeat), and the arc from observer to heir feels truncated. The resolution lacks tension payoff, leaving the story’s completeness dependent on reader assumption.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through sensory details (e.g., “costumes hung like ghosts,” supernatural silence) and tightly woven to the sinister premise. The opera house’s physical and emotional decay, particularly the “soundless sanctuary,” enhances both setting and theme. However, some descriptions border on cliché (“grotesque picture,” “centuries of hoarded voices”) without fully transcending genre tropes.</comment>
