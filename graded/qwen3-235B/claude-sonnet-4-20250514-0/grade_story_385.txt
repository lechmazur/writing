<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (decoding symbols) is clear but underexplored; "pleasant meddler" persona works but feels surface-level in a story that prioritizes mystery over psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strained by compressed scopeâ€”thematic throughlines exist (death/life liminality), but structural momentum falters in balancing worldbuilding and narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (obsidian skyscraper, liminal time), but sensory details are sparse; setting functions thematically rather than immersively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (tide, seeds), but emotional resonance is undercut by abstract finality; ending avoids pat resolution but risks emotional detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending medical and occult themes, but the "ancient symbols in charts" premise leans on familiar esoteric tropes; prose is polished but occasionally over-decorated ("spaces between certainty and mystery").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack narrative urgency; the word limit sharpens focus on mood over plot, though underdevelopment of stakes weakens impact.</comment>
