<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and intellectual detachment, but lacks psychological depth; internal conflict between ethics and ambition remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure effectively compresses slow-burn obsession into tight space; transition from preparation to self-experimentation is logical and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pervasive sensory details (stained glass, warmed metal) create immersive time-capsule atmosphere that parallels protagonist's obsession with arrested potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (knitting as consciousness-manipulation) and intellectual themes compensate for somewhat flat emotional register in final confrontation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through unusual intersections (philosophy + handicrafts), but contains occasional over-ornate descriptions that distract from immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively to explore enlightenment-as-violation theme; brief format works as self-contained descent into transcendent madness.</comment>
