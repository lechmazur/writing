<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks nuanced development; abrupt shift from mechanical perfectionism to inheriting guardianship feels underexplored. The "annoyingly precise" attribute informs her craft but isn't woven into emotional arc, and tears-unfolding-truth mechanic feels contrived rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dramatic action (discovering family truth) is clear but unevenly paced. The trunk/gown/album sequence creates artificial momentum; the transition from puzzle event to temple feels disconnected from the thematic resolution. Plot coherence suffers under compressed word limit, particularly in connecting marionette performances to newfound purpose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setting is superficially rendered. Greek temple and "moonlit silence" offer visual cues without cultural specificity or tactile detail. Atmosphere of "alone intimacy" fails to evoke genuine emotional weight; sensory elements (stone, silk) are generic rather than immersive. Historical setting doesn't deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphor clusters ("symphonies of truth," "strings of sacred purpose") become hollow rather than haunting. Emotional beats are often told rather than demonstrated; "tears streaming down cheeks" lacks visceral impact. The ending's thematic declaration feels forced compared to the restrained strangeness of the discovery sequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly reliant on gothic tropes (tragic family secrets in ancient temples) without subversion. The "tears revealing hidden folds" conceit borders on mechanical fantasy rather than organic symbolism. Emotional progression relies on stated transformations ("hands finally shook") rather than layered character work. Prose occasionally bogs down in adjective-heavy declarations about "guardians of forgotten histories."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story strains under weight of assigned elements rather than organically integrating them. While the puzzle-event framework and wedding-gown discovery create momentum, the Greek temple remains a generic vessel rather than a culturally specific space. Thematic ambitions outpace the execution within tight constraints, leaving ideas underdeveloped despite polished surface prose.</comment>
