<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s stoicism feels superficial; internal conflict lacks depth, and the “personally impersonal longing” remains vague and disconnected from actionable motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; the oil drip as temporal marker is arbitrary, and the plot’s mystical resolution feels abrupt rather than organic within the constrained structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive and evocative—nature reclaiming a sacred space, humming stones, and oil dripping from a car create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere that elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolism (apple trees as spiritual decay, bees as liminal messengers) resonate thematically, but the ending’s transcendence glosses over underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unsettling metaphors (e.g., “personally impersonal”) feel overwritten; some sensory details (e.g., shimmering air) lean on clichéd mystical tropes, while the tone shifts unevenly between noir and mysticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but uneven—strong atmosphere falters under underdeveloped character arcs and a resolution that feels more poetic than earned, limiting its overall cohesion and market readiness.</comment>
