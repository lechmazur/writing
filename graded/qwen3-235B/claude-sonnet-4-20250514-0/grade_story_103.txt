<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character development is emotionally resonant, but some introspective moments border on melodrama. The knight's transformation feels earned yet could delve deeper into his internal conflict beyond reflective imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed for the word limit, though the leap from epiphany to decisive action feels slightly rushed. Pacing sustains tension effectively but could benefit from a more nuanced progression between key moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through jagged reefs and storm symbolism, though the lighthouse's metaphysical properties (e.g., time-folding reflection) lack grounding in the physical world's rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional emotional impact through layered metaphors (knocker's reflection as moral reckoning). The thematic exploration of redemption via tangible artifacts elevates the narrative beyond typical tragic arcs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines through the "pattern of conscience" conceit and lyrical subversion of knightly duty. Avoids trope exhaustion by making symbolism actively drive both character and plot rather than decorate it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compelling cohesion across elements creates lasting resonance. While some transitions (e.g., immediate shift from duty to defiance) could be smoother, the narrative voice maintains authority throughout.</comment>
