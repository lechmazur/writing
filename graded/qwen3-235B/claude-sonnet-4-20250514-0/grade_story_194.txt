<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "spirited" and "gracefully awkward" are present but not deeply explored; motivation for learning healing traditions feels underdeveloped despite surface-level explanations of war visions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative follows a coherent path from bike ride to revelation, but the compressed arc feels rushed; the connection between Mara's lumberjack identity and her healing preparation lacks nuanced integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (skull-lined walls, femur chandeliers) create a memorable atmosphere, but the ossuary-turned-restaurant setting's thematic potential (death/life duality) remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of bone-blood metaphor, juxtaposition of destruction/healing; some overwritten phrases ("harsh tenderness") detract, but coded letter's dual role as artifact/omen elevates the theme.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dystopian war-healer tropes undercut originality; bone/wound soil similes show creativity, but "resistance watching her" feels formulaic; avoids AI-like repetition but leans on familiar archetypes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Strong atmospheric tension and symbolic resonance exist, but underdeveloped character psychology and contrived element integration (ossuary restaurant's relevance) limit cohesion.</grade>
