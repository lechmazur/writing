<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lyra's traits are present but lack emotional depth; rebelliousness feels more aesthetic than integral to her choices, and motivations are stated more than demonstrated through lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Limited by word count, the plot connects key plot points logically but rushes the pivotal revelation; the shift from mystery to revelation lacks immersive build-up despite structural coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere with rich visual metaphors (ivy, rust), but emotional weight leans too heavily on descriptive inertia rather than sensory urgency or visceral stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative prose with symbolic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract exposition; themes reverberate but lack the piercing specificity needed for transcendent memorability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but follows a familiar "haunted discoverer" narrative arc; some lush descriptions border on ornamental excess without fully subverting genre expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Craftsmanship exceeds formulaic writing but lacks the radical imaginative recalibration that would make its exploration of memory feel revolutionary rather than elegiacally familiar.</comment>
