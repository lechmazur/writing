<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but underdeveloped; motivations (dreams, legacy) are clear yet lack psychological nuance. Internal conflict is stated rather than dramatized, diminishing emotional resonance. The "unruffled" trait is inconsistently demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has symbolic progression but strained pacing; the discovery-to-revelation arc satisfies thematically but feels compressed. Cause-effect between dream notes and the climax is abstract rather than logically earned. Structural coherence suffers from underdeveloped transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but unevenly prioritized. The library’s decay is evocative (crumbling light, dust), but "café conversations" remain shallow worldbuilding gestures rather than organic context. Sensory details elevate the ruins but not the broader setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant metaphors ("red streak of defiance") and paradox-as-wisdom conceit are strong, but over-reliance on abstract statement ("some sorrows healed by joy") weakens catharsis. Themes are coherent but occasionally overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise with paradoxical logic avoids cliché, but risks derivative phrasing ("wildest kind of joy") and emotionally flat dialogue undermine uniqueness. Emotional subtext is present but strained by on-the-nose exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated thematically but uneven in functional necessity. The dream dictionary is central, but café setting and gleam symbolism feel conceptually redundant. Lingering questions over meaning exist but lack narrative urgency.</comment>
