<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Character development is strong in showing Marcus's suppressed past resurfacing, but the abrupt transition from stoicism to revolutionary zeal lacks sufficient psychological nuance. The cameo catalyzes change effectively, but the emotional progression feels compressed for such a pivotal transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through symbolic actions (wearing the cameo, witnessing movement in miniatures) but struggles with time compression. The final resolution feels slightly rushed—twenty-three years of disconnection resolved in a single night requires stronger narrative justification.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create a haunting atmosphere—echoing footsteps, glass-reflected identity fractures, miniature protesters. The miniature world museum setting works seamlessly with the theme of suppressed history, though harvest festival specifics remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story evokes poignant melancholy through subtext—glass as barrier/reflection, "climate-controlled" protests as commentary on institutional memory. The central tension between preservation and action is potent, though explicit narration ("suppressed rage") occasionally undercuts subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic writing with original imagery (rice-grain protest signs, pulsing cameos). Transitions between reality and surreal elements maintain internal logic. Subtlety in showing rather than stating Marcus's shift (hands pressing glass, changed exhibit plans) elevates craft beyond trope-based storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story weaves assigned elements into a cohesive thematic whole—miniatures mirror Marcus's internal fragmentation, cameo symbolizes buried rebellion. The ending avoids neat resolution while suggesting change, though the revolution's implications remain ambiguously underexplored within the confines of a single night.</comment>
