<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but feel surface-level; transformation lacks gradual buildup, relying on exposition over lived experience. The "fiercely loyal scout" label conflicts with sudden radicalization without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has conceptual coherence but suffers from compressed pacing; the comedian’s jokes drive action, but the arc from meditation to rebellion feels abrupt despite symbolic ties. Logical cause/effect holds, but emotional impact is diluted by brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong visual metaphors (moths, journal, outage) create mood, but the moth observation tower’s purpose feels underused. Sensory details (brass texture, flickering light) enhance dread but lack deeper ecological or scientific integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking symbolism (moths/light, meditation/radicalization) elevates themes, but relies on overwrought metaphors ("sanctified darkness") and some told-emotions. The ending’s thematic synthesis is effective, offsetting uneven execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in radicalizing comedy routines is notable, but repetitive descriptors ("sanctified dread") and moth motifs verge on cliché. Emotional arcs are nuanced but occasionally oversimplified ("fervor building in chest").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility (empty tower, unexplained power outage). The constrained form serves the metaphorical arc effectively, though some choices feel arbitrary rather than inevitable.</comment>
