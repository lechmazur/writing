<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Limited depth in motivations beyond academic curiosity; politeness feels contrived under stress; some behavioral consistency issues during crisis.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite plot economy; forbidden act of eavesdropping directly propels tension-resolution within tight constraints; logical cause-effect chain maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere; salt chamber's sensory details and laundry cycles create unique, haunting environment that meaningfully informs tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (crystals as cultural archives) and lingering thematic questions about unearthing buried history elevate impact; minor overindulgence in politeness mannerisms.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original integration of salt divination and laundry timekeeping stands out; polite panic borders on caricature; emotional subtext occasionally explicit rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements interdependent; each detail serves dual purpose (box as both artifact and narrative device); ending resonates thematically while leaving existential unease.</comment>
