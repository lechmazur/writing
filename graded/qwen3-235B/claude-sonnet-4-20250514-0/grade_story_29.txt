<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (personal regret and altruism) but internal conflict feels underexplored; "cleverly naive" trait stated rather than demonstrated through layered choices. Dialogue/non-narrative voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemptive arc predictably but remains coherent; beginning (streetlamp) and end (dawn) framing create closure. Pacing unevenâ€”machine neutralization rushed, emotional beats compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (humming fragment, silver-leaved trees) and contrasts (dying lamp vs. glowing orchard) build an immersive, melancholy-euphoric tone. Mysticism lacks grounding logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fragments of strong imagery ("agony beneath bliss") and metaphor ("music older than words") elevate emotional impact, while abrupt tonal shifts and excessive abstraction ("pure intention") dilute thematic subtlety. Ending resonates but feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Struggles with tropes (soul-feeding machines, lost-love redemption) without subverting them. Sensory details occasionally veer into vague aestheticism over meaning. Frequencies/translation as "language older than words" risks poetic redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Concepts forced together competently but without revelatory synergy; the Regret Engine's thematic potential outpaces its mechanical role. Leaves vague melancholy but no lingering philosophical question.</comment>
