<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character psychology lacks depth; motivations emerge abruptly without emotional or contextual scaffolding. The revelation of stolen memories doesn't align with consistent behavioral cues—all knowingness buried until plot demands it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a serviceable arc but relies on passive discovery (diaries) rather than active agency. The island's spinning maelstrom could've driven more urgent pacing to match the confinement of midwifery at a critical moment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes tension through tactile details—moonlit orchard, salt-tinged air, burning paper—blending decay and rebirth. The maelstrom's constant churn makes an effective metaphor for the erasure/reclamation theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor (herbs as memory vessels, fire as erasure/rebirth) and symbolic duality (midwife/goddess parallels). Ending avoids pat resolution by framing recovery as ongoing struggle. The final sentence's storm paradox lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong conceptual foundation, but execution veers toward familiar fantasy tropes (reclaimed memories, forbidden herbalism). Some phrases ("woven tapestries of truth") risk becoming flowery abstraction rather than grounded storytelling.</comment>
