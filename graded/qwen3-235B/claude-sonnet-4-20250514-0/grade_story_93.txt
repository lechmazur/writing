<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite evocative concepts; emotional responses feel secondhand, motivations lack psychological depth or contradictions that would make them compellingly human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented pacing due to compressed structure undermines tension; cause-and-effect between sacred geometry and labyrinth collapse feels intellectually imposed rather than dramatized through concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Hyper-specific worldbuilding elements (crystalline archives, pirate frequencies) create intellectual intrigue but lack tactile immediacy; atmosphere leans too heavily on conceptual metaphors without grounding sensory experiences.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Transcendent imagery elevates the narrative, but emotional register remains theoretical; thematic ambition exceeds the execution of character-driven resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Attempts subvert sci-fi archetypes but falters with overreliance on esoteric jargon and poetic abstraction; some transitions feel algorithmically associative rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</comment>Story assembles puzzle pieces competently but fails to ignite synergy; themes flicker with potential yet remain tethered to surface interpretations of its own metaphors.</grade>
