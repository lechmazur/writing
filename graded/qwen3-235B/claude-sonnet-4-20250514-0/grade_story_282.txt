<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's 'brashness' is stated but underdemonstrated; motivation to preserve traditions is clear but lacks nuanced reactions to objects that might reveal deeper psychological layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear beginning-middle-end progression, but the rapid progression from forging in the store to grand festival declaration feels slightly compressed in the word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic core undermined by inconsistent atmospheric execution and underdeveloped connections between assigned elements and deeper narrative functions.</comment>
