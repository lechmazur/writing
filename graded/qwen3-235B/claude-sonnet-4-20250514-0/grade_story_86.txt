<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character motivation despite hints of trauma; internal conflict insufficiently explored. Cybernetic elements don't fully shape personality beyond physical description.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Concise arc maintained through clear cause-effect chains, but balloon festival framing device feels superfluous. Pacing balanced with minor rushed moments near climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Immersive cyberpunk setting realized through tactile server descriptions and temperature contrasts. Candle-bone timeline connections create atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance between candle's endurance and historical memory theme. Subtext of truth as living lineage elevated through layered metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains familiar dystopia-resistant-martyr template. Candle transcendence breaks pattern; some descriptors verge on ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrated with varying success - candle and timeline work best. Festival framing lacks payoff. Leaves existential questions about cyclical struggle but remains constrained by form.</comment>
