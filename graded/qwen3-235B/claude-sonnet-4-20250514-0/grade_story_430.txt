<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character depth exists but feels compressed; internal conflict is present but secondary to dense lyrical prose, with underdeveloped nuances in Kael's struggle between love and curse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion exists, but pacing issues arise from condensing generational trauma into 500 words - the decisive moment of departure works, but the middle lacks progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually vivid yet inconsistent environment; kaleidoscopic beauty contrasts with emotional depth, but over-reliance on fragmented imagery creates disconnect between atmosphere and bodily experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (carousal = cycle) and emotionally resonant ending elevate the work, though some emotional beats are stated rather than embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While cursed lineage trope is subverted through poetic introspection and the child's transformative perspective, certain phrases ("darkness in veins") border on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack revelatory force; the central metaphor works despite feeling familiar rather than transcendent, with emotional impact diluted by stylistic excess.</comment>
