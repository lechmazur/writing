<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a cultural preservationist is clear but underexplored. Her manipulation of personal history feels insufficiently interrogated. Mrs. Chen's sudden trust lacks psychological nuance. Dialogue reveals character through exposition rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics driven by exposition rather than organic tension. The climax through shared silverware tradition feels hastily resolved. Pacing stumbles between dense backstory and underdeveloped present action. Logical connections between Maya's profession and her methods remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival provides effective atmosphere but underutilized symbolic potential. Sensory details (decaying rides, ghostly music) create mood but fail to integrate with cultural preservation themes. The setting's decay contrasts poorly with the tradition's vibrancy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Surface-level emotional resonance through silverware-as-metaphor. Effective imagery (fork's scratches as generational marks) contrasts with overtly stated themes. Ending achieves symbolic closure but lacks narrative tension. Subtext around cultural appropriation remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but employs familiar "last keeper of tradition" trope. Some overly precise descriptors ("weathered hands") verge on formulaic. Emotional beats (Maya's grandmother connection) feel constructed rather than earned. The sly agent angle lacks moral complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Educated balance between assigned elements and narrative cohesion. The carnival setting remains decoratively symbolic rather than thematically essential. Cultural preservation theme is clear but simplistic. Ending satisfies basic closure requirements without lingering complexity.</comment>
