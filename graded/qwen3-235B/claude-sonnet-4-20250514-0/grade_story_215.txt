<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters show surface-level development; Father Marcus’s rattled state and inward sociability are hinted at but lack depth. Helena’s motivation is clear but one-dimensional. Their dynamic feels underexplored, with sudden shifts in tone (e.g., Helena’s aggression melting away) inadequately grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The puzzle-solving plot is tightly paced but strains plausibility—symbols on a postcard aligning to electromagnetic seals feels contrived. The hidden archives twist is satisfying yet rushed; too much exposition crammed into limited space disrupts narrative flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The psychic research facility’s sterile ambience contrasts with the haunting dance atmosphere, but both settings lack sensory richness. The postcard’s Eiffel Tower image and symbols could deepen the mood but remain underutilized artifacts rather than integrated atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ending’s thematic payoff about synthesis works well, but emotional resonance depends on explicit exposition (“His true calling wasn’t banishing mysteries—it was solving them”). Dialogue (“You’re late for tango lessons”) is sharp but thinly written. The central conflict (fighting symptoms vs. causes) is introduced too late.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The psychic facility/dance lesson juxtaposition is clever but leans on genre tropes (hidden archives, ancient conspiracies). The postcard’s puzzle mechanism feels derivative. Phrases like “haunting melodies” verge on cliché; character nuance is undercut by blunt emotional signposting (“rattled nerves finally settling”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The eclectic elements cohere moderately well, but the tight word limit exposes forced connections—dance lessons as cover work feels gimmicky, and the postcard’s role strains credibility. The story hints at layered themes but lacks space to fully interrogate the faith/science synthesis, leaving it conceptually shallow.</comment>
