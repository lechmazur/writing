<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's transformation is plot-driven with minimal psychological nuance; motivation is abstract but consistent with actions; "surly" trait is superficial, barely influencing the yarn-reading method.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-action plot (weaving yarn) provides coherence; cosmic revelation feels rushed despite tight word count; concept shapes the plot but lacks layered progression; pacing uneven in reflective sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Graveyard setting and seasonal transition contribute strong atmosphere; sensory details (salt-crusted monuments, whipping wind) are evocative but occasionally generic; tone leans on clichéd bleakness more than earned tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of trade routes as cosmic patterns is clever; ending achieves thematic resonance; dialogue feels stilted ("Tell me the riddle of the stars"); underdeveloped conflict undermines emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasional forced lyricism ("dignified chaos") risks purple prose; "weathered headstones" and "tempestuous sky" border on cliché; character reasoning lacks idiosyncratic logic; cosmic-market connection feels clever rather than human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically (yarn method ties to elder, graveyard to sailors' knowledge) but lack surprising integration; ending lingers conceptually more than emotionally; tone remains narrowly reverent without complexity.</comment>
