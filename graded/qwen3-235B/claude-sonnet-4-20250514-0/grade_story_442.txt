<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations hinted at through artifacts rather than actions, limiting complexity and growth despite well-rendered tics like candle-as-metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot is static and ambient rather than driven; structure lacks momentum and causal progression despite poetic cohesion, making it feel incomplete within strict literary publication standards.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with tactile, organic details that amplify tone, though occasionally overwhelmed by maximalist description lacking narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stylistic precision and haunting metaphors elevate impact, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract introspection over active character stakes or resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids total formulaicity but stumbles with over-decorated prose ("comfortingly pessimistic") and AI-trope-like combinations (sentient fungus sanctuary, candle-as-light-metaphor) lacking subversive edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion in merging memory fragmentation with mechanical timekeeping, though the self-consciously poetic tone occasionally hinders emotional authenticity and universality.</comment>
