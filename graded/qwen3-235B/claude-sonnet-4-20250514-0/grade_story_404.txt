<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually distinct but lacks nuanced internal conflict; motivations are clear but underexplored emotionally. Dialogue has individuality but feels archetypal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structured around a single transactional moment; coherence maintained but emotional arc compressed, sacrificing depth for cosmic resolution. Pacing uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive but tonal dissonance between mystical and corporate elements weakens the setting’s thematic fusion. Sensory details evocative but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents and symbolic resonance (key/crust) elevate the narrative, though ending verges on sentimental rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with inventive worldbuilding but occasionally relapses into ornate abstractions ("unbearable loneliness") that dilute raw humanity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some (e.g., monk’s "wandering" nature) serve decorative roles. Briefness enhances poetic tone but limits character complexity.</comment>
