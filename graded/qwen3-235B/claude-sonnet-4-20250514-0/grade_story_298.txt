<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mei's "rationally impulsive" trait is stated but inconsistently demonstrated; her motivation to find emotional authenticity feels underexplored beyond simple plot necessity, though her connection to the dress does reveal layered reactions that deepen her characterization</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a compact arc from discovery to resolution, but the cold-case reveal feels slightly contrived; cause-effect logic holds but pacing near the climax sacrifices nuance; time-jumping coherence between past and present is mostly smooth</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Post-oil setting and palace decay merge strikingly through tactile details (cracked tiles, filtered light) that enhance mood; the solar-powered architecture concept is underutilized thematically but effectively establishes the dystopian backdrop</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors in the final act elevate the message about art and truth; the "anxious serenity" tone is well-maintained but lacks emotional complexity beyond surface descriptions; thematic threads about resource scarcity and memory are unevenly developed</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Genre tropes (detective/sleuthing, hidden evidence) feel slightly predictable despite futuristic setting; the phrase "emotional honesty" is repeatedly emphasized rather than demonstrated; prose balances clarity with occasional ornate description but generally avoids purple prose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Structure coheres despite tight constraints, though some elements (Detective Chen's role) feel underworked; the fusion of theatre and mystery is inventive, but deeper exploration of theatrical ethics or eco-collapse implications could elevate memorability</comment>
