<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and consistent defiance, but lacks emotional complexity beyond singular focus on her duty. Internal conflict hinted but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical trajectory from preparation to execution, but the short length limits development of the larger implications of her actions. Pacing well-balanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (golden threads, atom-core glow) establish mood effectively. "Borrowed dawn" tone contrasts poignantly with her lost past, though some worldbuilding remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegiac style with potent metaphors ("scar tissue of history") and layered themes about memory's persistence. Ending resonates metaphorically as much as narratively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most sci-fi clich√©s through poetic framing of temporal mechanics. Some descriptions ("sound like reality tearing") border on expected phrasing. Emotional stakes feel earned rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Successfully weaves assigned elements into cohesive whole without feeling forced. Leaves lingering meditation on memory's power, though broader consequences of timeline fractures could be more explicit.</comment>
