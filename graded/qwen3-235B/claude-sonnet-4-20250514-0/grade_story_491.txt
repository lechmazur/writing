<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lacks deep character voice or emotional transformation; motivations (resentment/respect for grandmother) are implied but remain abstract without specific behavioral anchoring. Internal conflict stated more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on mystical quilt unravelling, which feels narratively contrived despite poetic payoff. Pacing leans on metaphor-heavy exposition rather than organic cause-and-effect progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (humidity, ventilation whispers) but disjointed timeframe execution (lullaby silence) interrupts tonal consistency. Setting's liminal space concept remains more symbolic than visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and thematic resonance (hidden connections) elevate storytelling impact. Some telling ("profound artistry") dilutes otherwise evocative showing through botanical resurrection imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Subverts preservation trope through botanical resurrection theme, but phrases like "unraveling tight stitches" border on formulaic. Emotional nuance in grandmother/granddaughter dynamic hinted but underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements serve story through symbolic cohesion, though time constraints leave conceptual threads (lullaby timing, fisher occupation) underdeveloped. Lyrical prose maintains tension between science and mysticism effectively.</comment>
