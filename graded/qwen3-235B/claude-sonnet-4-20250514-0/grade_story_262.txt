<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's alien nature and 'righteously flawed' motivation are present but underdeveloped; emotional conflict feels surface-level despite clear stakes</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure effectively follows a rise-to-revelation arc, but the compressed ending sacrifices some thematic nuance (e.g., war implications)</comment>
