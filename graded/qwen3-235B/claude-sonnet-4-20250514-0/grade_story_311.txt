<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus's trauma and motive are compelling but Elena remains a plot device. His 'serene anger' voice works well, though his decisive confrontation feels underdeveloped given years of suppressed rage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear structure works within constraints but pacing falters in middle - the confrontation is abrupt, consequences glossed over. Connection between beginning surveillance and endgame justice feels superficial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse's artificial paradise vs. sterile conspiracy works well, with effective details (jasmine scent, cucumber vines). Earth's visual motif succeeds, though lunar setting could better reflect psychological containment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (garden as prison/birthplace) add depth. Ending's poetic justice resonates, though emotional beats rely partially on exposition. Subtext about control vs. freedom is effective but insufficiently nuanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Few clich√©s, but genetic weapon trope is predictable. Dialogue avoids artificiality but some phrases ('beautiful terrible place') lean on easy contrasts. Subtle tension builds naturally, though atmospheric details occasionally overwhelm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but functional choices dominate over organic ones. The tight length creates necessary urgency but undermines emotional weight. Ending delivers closure while lacking visceral impact.</comment>
