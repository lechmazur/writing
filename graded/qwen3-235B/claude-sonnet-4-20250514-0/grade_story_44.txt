<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Limited internal conflict; motivations align with traits but lack psychological depth. Some actions reflect feistiness but character feels archetypal rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear transformation arc exists, but minimal narrative tension. Momentum relies on concept rather than structural complexity. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Space setting vividly rendered through tactile details (plasma flame, floating debris). Atmosphere of cosmic decay contrasts with artistic creation, enhancing thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich execution elevates theme. Subtext about tradition/innovation is potent, though emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral. Ending achieves thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of blacksmithing metaphor with sci-fi elements. Avoids overt clich√©s, but character psychology occasionally veers toward sentimental abstraction. Language remains precise yet lyrical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong conceptual cohesion despite tight constraints. Elements serve thematic unity, though some (car rides) feel underexplored. Leaves lingering questions about artistic preservation in progress-obsessed societies.</comment>
