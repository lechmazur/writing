<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are well-integrated with their actions, with nuanced portrayal of emotional vulnerability. The central conflict between solitude and connection is consistently articulated through both characters' shared 'collecting' metaphor. Dialogue maintains distinct voices while advancing thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains clear progression through escalating game rounds that mirror emotional shifts. Cause-and-effect logic regarding character decisions is sound, though some transitions between games could be smoother. Pacing within word constraints is impressively compressed yet coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines elemental harshness with unexpected domesticity effectively, using specific details like frost crystal formations and game shelves. The cold environment meaningfully connects to emotional states but could delve deeper into olfactory/austere temperature sensations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance achieved through layered metaphor (collecting as emotional armor, board games as battlefield of connection). Unstated subtext about mutual recognition of brokenness creates lingering impact. Ending balances hope and realism without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through paradoxical tone blending irony with sincerity. Sensory details feel specific rather than generic. Emotional progression emerges organically rather than exposition. Only occasional overreliance on "frost" descriptors slightly dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements interrelate organicallyâ€”collection habits define both characters' worldviews; frost giant's lair serves both literal/thematic purposes. Brief form intentionally used to create emotional compression rather than limitation, ending with memorable conceptual reverberation.</comment>
