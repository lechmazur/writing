<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Core motivation clear but underexplored; emotional evolution feels more symbolic than psychologically nuanced, with transformation emerging abruptly from manuscript encounter rather than gradual internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc present but compressed—planting/collection scenes feel rushed. Cause-effect between manuscript revelation and floral transformation lacks connective tissue that would make the metamorphosis resonate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually rich with crystalline shelves and bioluminescent seeds, but atmospheric density occasionally suffocates character psychology rather than amplifying it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphor layering (mapping/connection/springs) creates thematic resonance. Ending synthesizes motifs effectively, though emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction more than earned vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally overwrites with elaborate similes ("thunderous flutter"). Subtext about cyclical renewal is fresh, but some descriptors ("crimson petals marking convergence") verge on conventional fantasy phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified meditation on transformation. The 500-word constraint strains developmental pacing but amplifies the story's poetic ambition as a parable.</comment>
