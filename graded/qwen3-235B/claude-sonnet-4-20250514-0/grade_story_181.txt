<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Consistent motivation (seeking lost preservation techniques) but shallow emotional complexity; relationship with Marcus feels hastily constructed despite hints of deeper history and longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Beginning/end connection is clear, but the shift to romantic climax disrupts narrative momentum; progression from investigation to revelation is well-paced but undercut by abrupt tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion through spice/ancient book parallels, but the bird sanctuary’s potential remains underexplored beyond atmospheric set dressing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (turmeric light, alchemy parallels) elevate the prose; the ending’s emotional resonance is undercut by predictable romantic resolution despite layered themes of legacy and innovation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages approach purple prose (“time crystallized”), but the fusion of science/history tropes with personal stakes avoids formulaic storytelling; emotional subtext through gestures (trembling finger, hovering scent) feels nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are mostly integrated but not always transformative; the spice trader’s obsession and discovery generate thematic cohesion, while the sanctuary and kiss timing strain plausibility.</comment>
