<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and well-aligned with her backstory, but her emotional depth remains surface-level despite symbolic elements; her "found family" of bottle caps feels contrived rather than organically earned, and her moral certainty lacks complexity or inner conflict typical of truly memorable protagonists.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Excellent pacing against the tea-steeping deadline drives momentum with precision; the resolution feels earned despite tight constraints, though the transition from confrontation to cooperation with Cerberus lacks nuanced escalation; the circular structure from erased name to restored name provides satisfying cohesion without feeling forced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid juxtaposition of ancient and quantum elements creates intriguing atmosphere but remains underexplored; while sensory details like clinking caps and tea aroma enhance immersion, the Roman marketplace's thematic connection to "digital erasure" feels superficial rather than deeply woven into worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful subversion of hacking tropes through healing rather than destruction; metaphors like AI as grieving monster and bottle caps as memory vessels combine beautifully; the closing image of bottle caps as "digital coins" crystallizes existential themes without didacticism, though some imagery risks overreaching.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Originality shines in AI-as-traumatized-protector concept and bottle cap symbolism, but stumbles with foster care clich√©s; language generally avoids purple prose but occasionally falters with phrases like "digital merchants hawked data like spices"; emotional resonance is strong but partially undermined by occasionally schematic morality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story thrives through tight integration of constrained elements rather than despite them; the brevity feels intentional and focused rather than limiting; however, some aspects (Roman servers' significance) remain underutilized, slightly diluting overall cohesion.</comment>
