<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters feel conceptually flattened; Vera's ruthlessness manifests only superficially through exposition rather than nuanced behavior, while Marcus's "spontaneity" lacks organic evolution. Their dynamic could benefit from deeper psychological exploration beyond functional roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function efficiently but lack emotional depth. The stone-circle-to-social-media theft premise is clever yet requires frequent narrative shortcuts. Pacing falters slightly in connecting Vera's call to authorities with the arriving sirens, creating a friction between high-concept execution and emotional plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (chalk's invisibility, comb's broken teeth) create visceral atmosphere. The megaliths' predawn setting and folk-song interludes effectively blur ancient/modern tension. However, deeper environmental interaction could strengthen metaphysical resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "watcher/witness" duality offers intellectual heft, particularly in the reversal of surveillance power. Some ideas (e.g., artistic theft as existential threat) could be more subtly embedded through symbolic flourishes rather than exposition-laden dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by merging Neolithic mystery with digital-age artistry theft. The stone-circle-arrangement parallelism demonstrates ingenuity. Minimal purple prose; emotional beats shown through actions (Vera's surgical stem placement) rather than stated. No obvious AI-flavored writing detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Despite tight constraints, the story balances concept density without sacrificing momentum. The stone circle functions as both literal and metaphorical "arrangement" space. While the ending feels too neat for Vera's ruthlessness, the creative synthesis of elements (ancient/modern, watcher/watched) creates lingering thematic resonance.</comment>
