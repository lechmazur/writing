<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivations and freelancer background lack deep exploration; her sudden role shift feels underdeveloped despite thematic resonance in connecting her varied skills to engine mastery. Captain Thorne’s mentorship lacks emotional complexity beyond clichéd elder-wisdom tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pacing feels uneven—wedding framing serves little purpose, and the abrupt transition to Maya’s enlightenment undermines gradual character growth. Plot relies on thematic convenience rather than organic narrative causality within the constrained scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Steampunk elements (copper pistons, boiler systems) create vivid atmosphere, but the post-wedding setting is superficially integrated. Sensory details (amber warmth, wave rhythms) enhance mood but lack layered specificity to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (amber as memory vessel, wave-like engine adjustments) carry thematic weight, but emotional impact is diluted by exposition-heavy dialogue. The ending resolves cleanly, yet the thematic exploration of "apprenticeship vs. documentation" feels surface-level rather than transformative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sterile descriptions (“scattered harmony,” “wave-song”) veer toward generic lyricism. While avoiding overt clichés, character psychology and subtextual tension feel artificial—Maya’s epiphany reads as predetermined rather than earned through nuanced narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story coheres minimally despite crowded element roster; wedding timeframe and freelancer background strain narrative unity. The theme of preserving wisdom is clear but overly reliant on explicit thematic statements rather than organic integration, leaving emotional resonance underdeveloped.</comment>
