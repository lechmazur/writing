<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (doubt/confidence), but 'dry-tongued' feels symbolic rather than fully embodied. The voice is poetic but risks archetypal vagueness in internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot arcs from self-doubt to liberation with symbolic cohesion, but relies on condensed epiphany rather than dramatized progression. Tightly contained yet slightly too swift in emotional development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich fungal acoustics and lunar prism effects immerse readers in a unique sensory world. Timeframe amplifies intimacy, though atmospheric consistency occasionally falters in transition beats.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor layering (cloak, prism, prison) and resonant imagery elevate the thematic depth. Emotional payoff emerges through action rather than abstraction, though subtext remains limited in scope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Distinguishes itself through mushroom hall's living acoustics and fragmented storytelling, but voicemails-as-device border on modern convenience rather than mythic integration. Lyrical prose occasionally teeters toward embellishment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively as symbolic ecosystem rather than checklist additions. While short-form constraints limit expansion, the final fusion of light/voice/body creates a resonant takeaway on imperfection.</comment>
