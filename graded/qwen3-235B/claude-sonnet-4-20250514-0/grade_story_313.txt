<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations shift too abruptly; Marcus's transformation lacks sufficient internal conflict. His con artist background is established but not deeply integrated with his sudden remorse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed within the word limit. The interrogation device drives sparse exposition but resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (toxic soil, drones) but setting details like the farmhouse feel underexplored thematically. Sensory details create immersion but struggle with consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uses potent symbols (tape dispenser, poisoned earth) but emotional resonance is undercut by overt exposition. The ending's symbolism works but feels somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids complete clich√© through specific details (contaminated earth as inheritance) but tone occasionally veers toward generic "despair-as-aesthetic." Metaphors like "radioactive rain" feel overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack narrative integration. The story works structurally but doesn't fully transcend its assigned prompts to feel organically conceived.</comment>
