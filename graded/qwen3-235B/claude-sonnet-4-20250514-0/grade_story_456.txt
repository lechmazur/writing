<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like 'morbid florist' and 'neutrally passionate' are superficially established but underdeveloped; emotional transformation feels abrupt despite thematic alignment with cosmic cycles; dialogue is minimal and lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear structure with the candle's flame driving urgency, but the epiphany feels compressed within the word limit; cause-effect between reading the pages and character change is logically sound but underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid but generic (floating rock dojo, cosmic winds); fails to fully leverage the unique atmosphere for emotional impact; sensory descriptions prioritize spectacle over immersive specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of candle as metaphor for fleeting understanding and cosmic rhythm; ending ties back to character's profession with thematic resonance; emotional arcs rely too heavily on direct exposition rather than subtext or action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality in combining floristry with cosmic metaphysics; however, phrases like 'stellar dust' and 'cosmic winds' verge on cliché; transformation arc feels mechanically triggered by assigned elements rather than organically earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is uneven—some elements (candle, lantern timeframe) integrate beautifully while others (boldly timid tone, neutrally passionate attribute) feel superfluous; thematic clarity exists but lacks literary sophistication for top-tier standards.</comment>
