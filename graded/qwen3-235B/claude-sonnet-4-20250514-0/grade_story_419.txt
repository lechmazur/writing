<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's empathic nature drives her preservationist role, but "no-nonsense" dimension lacks sufficient demonstration through actions. Motivation to preserve traditions is consistent but underexplored through psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence and miniature-scale wonder maintained, but the transition from forging to spectral awakening lacks narrative tension. Final transformation feels abrupt despite tight constraints. Pacing prioritizes ambiance over plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting's melancholic reverence is masterfully rendered through tactile descriptions of forge heat, prismatic light, and tactile dollhouse details. Timeframe's cosmic decay contrasts effectively with the warmth of preserved traditions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and thematic resonance about cultural memory through the ornament's symbolism. Ending transcends sentimentality but risks abstraction. Conflict between preservation and entropy is present but under-dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Language avoids overt clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("emotional echoes trapped in painted walls") but occasional phrase patterns verge on poetic repetition. Emotional resonance emerges through environment rather than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements, though some feel ornamental rather than essential. The dollhouse's transformation achieves conceptual payoff despite brevity. Lingering question about legacy and remembrance elevates it beyond pure fantasy tropes.</comment>
