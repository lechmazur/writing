<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's reluctance and quiet courage are expressed through actions and symbolic objects, but interiority feels underdeveloped. The dinosaur plush hints at backstory but doesn't fully explore emotional nuances beyond nostalgia. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compact, cyclical structure works well within constraints. The dream-hopping method maintains logical cause-effect through the tapestry motif, though pacing slightly bogs down during middle dream sequences before accelerating to the thematic resolution. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually striking with xenon-blue decay and gauzy dreamscape contrasts, though sensory detail relies too heavily on sight. The tapestry's golden grief and plush fabric texture provide strong tactile anchors where olfactory/auditory elements are missing. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (spider-silk time, bridge/chasm transformation) resonate. Ending avoids clich√© by embracing acceptance over triumph. Subtext about healing through memory integration shows depth. Prose occasionally tilts toward ornate but maintains emotional resonance through concrete images like unsent letters. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elevates fantasy tropes with specific imagery (mother's cut lullaby, soldier's ghost letter). Avoids overt sentimentality by focusing on tangible details over abstract emotion. The "satisfied sigh" of a machine skirts anthropomorphism but works as metaphor for psychological release. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically with minor friction. Short form constraints limit expansion of secondary motifs like the soldier's thread, but the dinosaur plush-threadbare yet enduring-lingers effectively. The year-as-backdrop creates temporal ambiguity that slightly weakens overall cohesion.</comment>
