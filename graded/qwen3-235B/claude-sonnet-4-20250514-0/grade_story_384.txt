<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Marco's transition from obsession to revelation feels abrupt; motivations tied to grandmother's stories lack depth, and his "frantic energy" inconsistently shifts to unshakeable calm without sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum stalls in the middle; decoding process is condensed to the point of feeling rushed, and the climax's confrontation lacks buildup despite a coherent beginning-to-end structure within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (dust, equipment hum, dancing motes) create a vivid tension between the mundane kitchen and the facility's hidden purpose, though the "centuries of layered dust" strains plausibility in a technological setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "poison disguised as protection" and symbolic objects (walking stick, pencil eraser) deepen thematic resonance; the ending’s layered implications on institutional betrayal pack an emotional punch despite occasional overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by overreliance on dramatic phrases ("geological destiny") and a few AI-like tics, such as the illogical "centuries of dust" in a modern facility; emotional beats are shown but occasionally softened by cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>The story’s core idea is compelling, but forced elements (pencil eraser as decoding tool, implausible dust accumulation) and strained metaphoric logic weaken cohesion, making the premise feel more contrived than inevitable.</comment>
