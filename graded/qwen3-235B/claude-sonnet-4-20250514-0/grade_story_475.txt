<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has melancholic depth but motivations remain overly abstract; emotional transitions feel abrupt despite atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but compressed; pivotal realizations occur without sufficient emotional buildup or tension within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned circus setting rendered with visceral sensory details that amplify thematic decay, though deeper connection between physical objects and psychological states occasionally lacks.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (lullabies as codes) intellectually stimulating but emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on clich√©d dystopia imagery like "digital chains"; ending feels overly tidy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Generic phrases ("digital surveillance state," "feral elegance") surface frequently; while subversive analog rebellion has novelty, tone sometimes mirrors AI-generated melancholic nostalgia tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric unity diluted by uneven integration of assigned elements; thematic ambition outweighs execution in this constrained format.</comment>
