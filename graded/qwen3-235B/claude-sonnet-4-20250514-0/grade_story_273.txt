<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While Evangeline's disguised nobility influences her resources, her psychological depth remains muted; her honest nature drives actions but isn't fully interrogated beyond surface-level defiance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels condensed; the action (bottles) drives the narrative, though the Council confrontation lacks developed tension and resolution within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Swamp fortress and gondola create eerie atmosphere, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid; pre-universe timeframe is conceptually rich but underexplored in atmospheric support for character motives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subtext about memory as resistance resonates; the bottles symbolize enduring truth effectively. Dialogue occasionally veers toward didacticism but is outweighed by potent themes of preservation amid erasure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some lush descriptions border on purple prose ("ethereal swamps"), and the "Council of Architects" leans on technocratic villain tropes. However, wine bottles as archival vessels offer fresh mechanical symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concepts are competently woven, but the incognito nobility feels decorative rather than integral; worldbuilding dominates over character interiority, marring overall cohesion.</comment>
