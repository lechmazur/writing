<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt and obsession anchor the narrative, but inner conflict remains surface-level; emotional nuances lack depth despite thematic hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure connects key moments, but reliance on convenient symbolism (string/locket) slightly undermines organic progression within the restrictive word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like "crushing ocean depths" and the lighthouse beam enhance mood, though isolation of setting sometimes overpowers character immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (puzzles as spiritual journey) and subtext (string as reconciliation bridge) elevates the narrative beyond sentimental tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("weight of secrets," "optimistically bitter") that feels self-consciously literary rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional undercurrents and thematic cohesion overcome occasional narrative contrivance; ending resonates without fully transcending its constraints.</comment>
