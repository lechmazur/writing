<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a quiet arc from isolation to triumph, though the tight word count leaves some transitions feeling underdeveloped; car backfire moment adds atmospheric tension but doesn't actively propel the narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Story successfully integrates required elements into thematic framework, though some aspects (sun path navigation) feel conceptually superficial; strong thematic cohesion and lingering metaphor compensate for mechanical looseness in implementation.</comment>
