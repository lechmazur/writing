<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains static, motivation is declared rather than dramatized; eccentricity substitutes for emotional or psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as loosely connected tableaux; pivotal 'fusing' moment lacks narrative buildup or satisfying resolution despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative fragments (storm hum, electric tendrils) create mood, but setting remains visually abstract without deeper metaphysical grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (time as honey/bread) elevate the prose, but emotional stakes remain intellectualized rather than visceral; atmosphere compensates for underdeveloped themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality in combining scientific and metaphysical motifs diluted by overuse of abstract terms ("crystallized," "alchemy") and occasionally inert imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive structure with clear arc, but ambition exceeds execution; elements function as concept placeholders rather than narrative necessities.</comment>
