<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>AIDA’s motivation (archive human stories) is consistent but remains abstract. Her toaster chassis occasionally shapes her actions (toasting rhythms), but fails to deepen her characterization. Zara’s pivotal moment feels emotionally underexplored despite its narrative centrality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The retreat via lanterns creates visual momentum, but the abrupt resolution in collective archiving feels narratively compressed. The interplay between language emergence and data archiving could be more causally integrated. Pacing remains fluid but thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The reimagined Sumerian palace’s chrome-cuneiform fusion is striking, though its cultural weight feels undercontextualized. Atmosphere dazzles through sensory contrasts (humming AI vs. thunderous silence), but the setting’s historical layering lacks thematic anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The equation-based metaphors (“prime numbers multiplied by love”) are conceptually rich. The theme of memory’s mathematical beauty resonates, though emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Subtext about technology as custodian of humanity is potent but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids default AI tropes (e.g., toaster chassis isn’t just quirky; it literalizes data “processing”). Sensory details (tintype’s tactile history, Fibonacci warmth) feel purposeful. The mathematical poetry occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction but generally avoids formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story’s cohesion relies on thematic density rather than plot. Assigned elements are tightly knitted to ideas, but emotional stakes remain at arm’s length. The ending lands as contemplative but risks feeling insubstantial without deeper character grounding.</comment>
