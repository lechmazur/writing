<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and tied to his obsession with forbidden knowledge, but thin-lips and "formally casual" traits don't deeply influence behavior or decisions. Final revelation about eternal searching lacks emotional depth despite clear thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from ritual preparation to tragic transformation, but pacing rushes key moments (mine collapse, artifact's true nature). Cause-effect between actions and consequences work, though emotional stakes feel truncated by word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Abandoned mine and crystalline formations create haunting atmosphere with vivid visual details. Thematic connection between setting and forbidden knowledge works, but underutilized sensory elements (e.g., tactile sensations of dust/decay) limit full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("dam bursting," "calendar page flipping") and cyclical structure elevate thematic resonance about knowledge's double-edged nature. Ending's philosophical weight is undercut slightly by explicit exposition about eternal hunger.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Weaves genre tropes (forbidden knowledge, cursed artifacts) with fresh twist about immortality's curse. Some phrase repetitions ("confusing certainty") and occasionally ornate descriptions threaten authenticity, but subversion of "cure for death" expectation shows ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements like "thin-lipped" and "formally casual" feel decorative rather than essential. Setting and central action (optimize rituals) successfully interweave, but emotional resonance suffers from brief execution. Theme about dangerous knowledge lingers effectively despite compression limitations.</comment>
