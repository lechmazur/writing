<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thomas shows depth through guilt and obsession; motivations tied to grief and honesty are clear but slightly underdeveloped. His actions align with his traits, though emotional nuances feel occasionally schematic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has cohesion with a clear arc, but pacing strains under abrupt exposition about radio wave metaphysics. The connection to letting go is satisfying, yet the middle relies on abstract concepts over dramatized cause/effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decaying technology among nature is vividly rendered through tactile descriptions (rusted metal, electrically charged air) and haunting auditory details (echo harmonics, transformed voice). Sensory integration is strong but could deepen temporal specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance through layered metaphors (railways/abandonment, static/erasure) and lyrical symbolism. The ending's thematic clarity ("some railways lead to acceptance") elevates its impact despite minor on-the-nose phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in synthesizing electromagnetic physics with grief psychology. Avoids clich√©s with specific imagery (termites in timber, thunderstorm superstition). Occasional overwrought phrasing ("despairing cheer") mars otherwise fresh emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified artistic vision about technological longing. The brevity emphasizes emotional beats, though scientific explanations could benefit from more organic integration. Leaves lingering meditation on mapping as psychic process.</comment>
