<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth; Marina’s shift feels abrupt without immersive emotional subtext or nuanced internal conflict beyond stated emotions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The central conflict resolves logically, but the compressed arc relies heavily on exposition (“I found this in a shipwreck”) over dramatized action, creating pacing unevenness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Meticulously rendered setting merges symbolically with thematic concerns; the carnival’s decay mirrors emotional and generational stagnation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery elevates the narrative, but the reliance on “thawing,” “honey,” and “drowned” as recurring metaphors occasionally borders on cliché.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some atmospheric details are vivid, but phrases like “rebellion singing in her veins” verge on melodrama; emotional nuance is often stated rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>A cohesive personal journey undercut by structural reliance on familiar archetypes (haunted carnival, amber as metaphor) executed without radical reinvention.</comment>
