<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's shyness is integral to her arc, with her eventual outward detachment becoming thematically significant. However, her internal conflict lacks nuanced emotional transitions, relying more on expository revelations than organic character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic bookends and clear cause-effect between posts and cosmic balance exist, but the breakneck pacing through infinite timelines feels compressed and emotionally disengaged, with the climax reduced to a metaphysical info dump.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Radiant, hyper-specific imagery (water-warped photographs, regret's pulsating frequency) creates haunting atmosphere. The abandoned market's physicality grounds abstract themes of entropy and documentation, though the city's abrupt ascent feels undercontextualized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cosmic metaphor gains unexpected philosophical heft through "failure-as-testimony" subtext. Effective symbolism (photos as breadcrumb trails, drowned city rising) and a thought-provoking ending elevate it, though some emotional beats remain declarative rather than enacted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in combining prophecy/social media is striking, but tonal consistency wavers. Some phrases ("luminous breadcrumbs") risk artificiality; human nuance occasionally yields to plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive despite dense elements, with each component (even the submerged setting) reflecting the core theme of visible vulnerability. The closing image offers resonance, though the ending's neat resolution slightly softens its existential edge.</comment>
