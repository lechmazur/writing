<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is minimally developed but possesses a clear conflict between his stage fright and resolve to break familial patterns. Motivation to redeem ancestral deception is consistent, but internal struggle lacks depth due to length constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive within word count but relies on compressed exposition about inherited lies and real demons. Pacing maintains momentum while leaving some transitions (e.g., entity arrival) feeling slightly abrupt. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid descriptions of space debris and claustrophobic tension. The orbital setting meaningfully shapes isolation and thematic decay, though sensory engagement beyond visual elements remains limited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story impresses with metaphorical language (flowers as false faith) and thematic exploration of inherited dishonesty, but emotional resonance is constrained by brevity. Concludes with satisfying thematic symmetry but limited subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids many genre clich√©s through sci-fi fusion but occasionally relies on expected ghost lore tropes. Some overwritten phrases ("star-drunk void") border on pretension while the central twist feels genuinely inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements though "never usual" and "toys" feel marginally underexplored. Technical polish and thematic commitment suggest strong authorship, despite minor pacing issues inherent to tight word count.</comment>
