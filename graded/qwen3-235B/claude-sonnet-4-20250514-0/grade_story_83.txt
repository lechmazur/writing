<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some original pairing of scientific precision with supernatural elements, but characterization occasionally reverts to genre conventions rather than inventing fresh emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but limited narrative ambition within restricted form; key elements create framework but don't fully interlock to elevate the whole beyond competent genre fiction.</comment>
