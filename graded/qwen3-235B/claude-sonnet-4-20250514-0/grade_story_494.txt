<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character transformation feels rushed; emotional shifts lack sufficient internal logic or external triggers to fully justify the abrupt repentance, relying too heavily on sentimental nostalgia as a narrative shortcut.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression depends on emotionally charged revelations delivered too rapidly, sacrificing nuance for dramatic effect; the tight word limit exacerbates an overall sense of narrative condensation over organic development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Multisensory details like “moonlight like captured starfire” and the auditory contrast between steel and melody are evocative, but superficial cultural references (mountain village weddings, calligraphy tropes) feel generic rather than deeply grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like “shackled potential” and the tapestry’s “invisible chains” offer thematic cohesion; however, emotional beats (e.g., the wedding song’s impact) are often told rather than shown, weakening resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose occasionally dazzles (“harsh tenderness like winter wind through cherry blossoms”) but frequently slips into predictable phrasing (“spark where all lights have gone out”) and sentimental clichés that dilute originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative coherence exists, but the deliberate fusion of assigned elements feels strained; many components (tapestry, song, authorization) serve thematic points too neatly without earning their narrative weight organically.</comment>
