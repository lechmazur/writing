<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but surface-level; Elena's scholarly defiance lacks nuanced emotional grounding, reducing her "rebellion" to abstract exposition rather than viscerally felt conflict. The "amiable" trait manifests superficially through benign actions without deeper personality shaping.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative progression is atmospheric rather than plot-driven; the connection between beginning and end relies heavily on mood rather than concrete arc. The "method" of communicating through timbers remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Pacing balances contemplation and revelation but sacrifices dramatic momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory integration of setting (creaking wood, shimmering energy) creates immersive atmosphere. The lighthouse's haunted history resonates thematically through specific details like salvaged beams, though some descriptions border on Gothic generalization rather than unique spatial realization.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic motifs (crossword as fractured history, vibrating wood as ghostly dialogue) offer intellectual resonance, but emotional impact is uneven. Literary devices like metaphorical heartbeat are effective yet occasionally undercut by overt explanation. The ending feels conceptually satisfying but emotionally cautious.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional reliance on maritime tropes (ghost ships, creaking wood) weakens originality. Phrases like "wooden bones" and "whispered histories" verge on mannered. Character psychology leans on profession-as-personality rather than humanizing contradictions. The "spectral messenger" clue feels contrived rather than organically eerie.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically around bridging past/future but struggles with element balanceâ€”some concepts (doubly singular) feel appended rather than integrated. The short form works well for atmospheric compression but sacrifices complexity. Lingering questions about methodology and historical mechanics suggest underdeveloped premises.</comment>
