<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent motivation in preserving tradition to escape death, actions align with traits, but limited emotional depth or growth in Finn's character beyond established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cogent structure with cyclical beginning/end at the cliff, action driven by ritual. Pacing tight but some transitions (e.g., ancestor materialization) lack setup, making the middle feel compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gritty-surreal atmosphere masterfully woven through sensory details—tremors, glowing roses, unstable air. The tectonic setting and hourglass distortion organically amplify tension, thematic resonance, and emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and layered metaphor (doorplate as memory, hourglass as defiance of time) evoke emotional complexity. The theme of memory transcending mortality is potent but slightly undercut by overreliance on poetic abstractions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh premise with tectonic rituals and spectral picnics, but occasional flowery phrasing ("melancholic glee," "deadly lullaby") strains naturalism without elevating subtext effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements like the doorplate and trembling cliff are organic to the narrative’s pulse, but the economy of 500 words risks underdeveloping Finn's relationships with ancestors, slightly diluting emotional stakes.</comment>
