<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Shallow emotional core despite strong traits. Nonchalance and obsession are visually rendered but lack inner conflict depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements combine competently but unspectacularly. Theme of chaos acceptance emerges organically but lacks philosophical complexity to elevate it to masterpiece status.</comment>
