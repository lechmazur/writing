<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is conceptually clear but lacks nuanced behavioral details to fully realize motivations; seashell as a memory anchor works well but broader characterization remains at arm's length.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent emotional journey with satisfying bookends, but spatial progression through the library and discovery of the booth feel under-motivated within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dreamlike descriptions of whispering books and crystalline architecture create powerful sensory immersion that thematically supports emotional themes, though some elements like the "dust motes as stars" verge on over-poeticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miracle-as-numbness paradox offers philosophical heft; tears as "small miracles" subverts expectation. However, emotional revelations occasionally tip into over-explaining rather than trusting reader interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rich imagery often crosses into purple prose ("patina of countless battles," "whispered secrets"), while the heroine's existential crisis leans on genre clich√©s of armored saviors finding inner emptiness rather than innovating the archetype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting elements like the library integrate artfully, but the choice of "floating" location and myth-reality boundaries feels driven by novelty rather than narrative necessity; overall cohesion exists but lacks urgent thematic imperative.</comment>
