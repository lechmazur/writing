<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character voice has flair but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel plot-convenient rather than psychologically consistent. Key items (bone dice) are underexplored in revealing character interiority beyond surface symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on happenstance convergence rather than organic conflict resolution; abrupt tonal shifts between western grit and cosmic mysticism disrupt narrative coherence despite effective use of the conjunction as endpoint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ambient details (gears, steam pipes) establish steampunk baseline but fail to integrate mystical text phenomena; tactile dissonance between cowboy gear and observatory lacks atmospheric cohesion despite occasional vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphoric moments (shifting text as narrative agent) contrast with flat dialogue cadence; theme of intertwined destinies remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant. Ending achieves closure but lacks thematic heft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on genre synthesis without fully interrogating either; atmospheric elements suggest depth but never fully transcend genre pastiche. Some evocative phrases diluted by formulaic exchanges between characters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but strain under demand for thematic integration; brevity exposes rather than exploits narrative potential. Lingering question about destiny remains superficial rather than transformational.</comment>
