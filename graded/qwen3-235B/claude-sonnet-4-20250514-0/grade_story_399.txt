<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Erasmus’ grumpiness is consistent but shallow; his trauma is hinted at via backstory but remains underexplored. His motivation to quell inner turmoil is clear, but reactions to the mandala feel abrupt rather than earned. The “uprising” metaphor lacks sustained integration with his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mandala-creation drives the plot effectively, with a clear arc from resistance to catharsis. Logical gaps exist (e.g., witch’s unexplained motives), but the stargazing timeframe and sand’s agency maintain coherence. Pacing is efficient for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal chamber and starlit atmosphere are vivid, with strong sensory details (gleaming facets, shifting sands). Tone occasionally veers toward melodrama, but setting-object linkage (tube/sand, mandala/geometry) enriches the mood and character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of trauma’s collective meaning emerge powerfully through symbolism (sand colors, mandala transformation). The ending avoids sentimentality by focusing on internal change. Subtext about healing through structured reflection is layered and emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unique metaphors (e.g., “uprising within,” “multiply singular” trauma) avoid clichés. Emotions are shown through actions (grimacing, hesitant compliance) rather than stated. Tone balances grandiosity and intimacy without succumbing to florid prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements like the tube and sand are tightly woven into the character’s role and theme. The final message feels earned, though the witch’s enigmatic presence limits narrative depth. Lingers as a poignant vignette with clear authorial intent.</comment>
