<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character exhibits surface-level motivations and generic inner conflict; nuanced personality beyond "sharp-witted dancer" remains underdeveloped despite clear duty vs. self struggle; actions inconsistently balance poetic desperation with concrete decision-making traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Solid three-act structure compressed into tight word count; ritual failure → dance innovation → thematic resolution flows logically; slight pacing issues with abrupt emotional shifts and underdeveloped transformation moment hinder perfect containment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically superficial environment; luminescent chamber bubbles mirror emotion without deeper integration; ancestral photo tradition creates weak link between family history and physical space; missed opportunities for atmospheric symbolism beyond color symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric dancing-as-language conceit executed with lyrical precision; prophecy subversion has emotional weight through physical transformation rather than conceptual revelation; consistent theme of tradition vs. evolution demonstrated rather than didactically stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids some sci-fi clichés through dance-as-language twist but retains prophecy structure familiar to genre; emotional description occasionally slips into "weight of denial" abstractions rather than embodied tension; atmospheric specifics sometimes generic despite evocative phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of assigned elements with minor forced connections; brief length reveals rather than conceals structural compression; thematic payoff outweighs execution flaws but leaves room for deeper exploration of inherited trauma's transformation.</comment>
