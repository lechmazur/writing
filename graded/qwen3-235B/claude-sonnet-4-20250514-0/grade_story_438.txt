<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters show minimal emotional depth; motivations are narratively functional but lack authentic interiority. Meridian’s dialogue feels archetypal rather than convincingly human, though Kara’s lineage-driven duty provides structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with thematic payoff, but relies on convenient reversals (Polaroids as deus ex machina) and compressed exposition. Pacing uneven in places but achieves conceptual resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong cosmic decay imagery competes with underdeveloped setting details—the lab and galaxy feel conceptually borrowed rather than organically realized. Atmosphere inconsistently maintained between technical and mystical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (engineered star maps, entropy-as-redemption) elevate the narrative. Subtext about inherited purpose and metaphysical science resonates. Ending’s thematic symmetry rewards careful reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most genre tropes through fusion of biopunk and existential philosophy. Some overreliance on weighty dialogue and recycled mystic figures; emotional beats occasionally reduced to abstraction rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but derivative—elements work together without redefining the genre. The ending’s thematic clarity elevates it beyond competent execution, but conceptual scaffolding occasionally shows through poetic veneer.</comment>
