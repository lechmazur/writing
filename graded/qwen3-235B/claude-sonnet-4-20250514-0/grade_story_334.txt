<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's arrogance and conflict are clear, but motivations are largely stated rather than organically revealed through nuanced behavior. Internal struggle feels more expository than viscerally rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains forward momentum through escalating tension, but the transition from decision to vortex dissolution feels underprepared. The compressed arc works within limits but lacks precise finality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting uses specific scientific details effectively, but atmospheric elements feel thin beyond visual distortions and humming metal. The observatory’s sterile quality could have been more viscerally contrasted with the artifact’s strangeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Echoes of existential themes emerge through parallel realities, but emotional stakes remain abstract. The choice moment carries weight through metaphor but lacks tactile immediacy in execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose occasionally lapses into mechanical phrasing ("crystallized motivation"). Subtext exists but is often overshadowed by declarative statements about mediocrity. Some AI-generated rhythmic uniformity appears in descriptive passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Successfully combines assigned elements but leans on familiar archetypes (rebel scientist, forbidden object). The central conflict resonates but doesn't break new thematic ground within its tight framework.</comment>
