<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict as a poet is established but lacks deeper complexity; motivation is clear but resolved too neatly without showing evolution, leaving psychological depth underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a quiet arc but struggles with compressed pacing—the cardinal's revelation feels abrupt; coherence is maintained despite constraints, though emotional beats could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and thematically integrated, with nature's reclamation mirroring Marcus’s emotional shift; sensory details are precise and atmospheric without redundancy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and poetic imagery elevate the story; the central metaphor of terror and wonder resonates thematically; the ending avoids trite resolution while prompting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified whole despite the brevity; the theme of artistic vulnerability is amplified by formal constraints, suggesting intentional craft over filler prose.</comment>
