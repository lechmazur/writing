<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear arc and consistent motivation, but lacks deeper psychological nuance; philosophical transformation feels slightly idealized without fully earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence between betrayal arc and labyrinthine journey but suffers from compressed chronology flattening tension; resolution feels somewhat inevitable rather than earned through narrative beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery present (floating lanterns, kaleidoscope refractions) but environmental integration inconsistent; labyrinth's symbolic function occasionally overshadows sensory anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphoric layering through kaleidoscope/labyrinth parallelism with strong thematic throughline; occasionally undermined by overt thematic statements rather than fully dramatized revelations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids simplistic tropes while flirting with archetypal structures; some phrasing (e.g., "authentic self") veers toward contemporary self-help platitudes that undercut mythopoetic aspirations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive metaphor system exists despite uneven execution; assigned elements form functional constellation but lack transcendent synthesis that would elevate to masterwork status.</comment>
