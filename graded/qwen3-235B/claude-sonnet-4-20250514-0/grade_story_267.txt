<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weak internal conflict; motivational shifts feel abstract rather than earned through organic character behavior. Blandness is narratively stated but lacks behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion exists despite compressed pacing challenges. Some corridor/folded space transitions verge on disorienting but maintain purposeful trajectory toward revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Promising elements undermined by uneven sensory detail. Black hole setting relies heavily on cosmic radiation mentions rather than immersive physical specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor density sustains thematic resonance but occasionally becomes self-obsessed. Conceptual ending satisfies thematic arcs but lacks emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through quantum echo cats and anvil-as-anchoring-device. Some phrasing ("savage bliss") risks pretension but overall subverts expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock conceptually but strain under tight word count. Philosophical resonance outweighs technical polish in final impression.</comment>
