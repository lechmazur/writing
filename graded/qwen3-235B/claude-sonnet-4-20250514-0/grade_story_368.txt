<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's orphan past is underexplored; motivations (harvesting hope from darkness) feel abstract rather than personal. Reactions to the brooch and temple lack emotional nuance, but streetwise instincts and internal contradiction (cynicism vs. hope) provide minimal depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing feels rushed in middle sections. While the plot follows a clear arc (external journey mirrors internal transformation), cause-effect logic around the brooch's mechanics and temporal shifts lacks anchoring within the constrained word count, creating gaps in coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion: pulsing vines, shifting cameo, reversed fruit patterns. The eerie beauty of the temple and tactile details (brooch warmth, fruit vibrancy) create a haunting, self-consistent world that deepens mystery rather than overwhelming it with description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich subtext interweaving time, perception, and self-discovery. Uses metaphor without overexplaining (e.g., cameo as future self; fruit map as unwritten history). Ending avoids pat sentimentality by grounding transformation in visceral physicality ("warmth spread through her").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in depicting "streetwise" character as vulnerable, not hardened. Some phrases border on ornate ("time moved across an unwritten calendar") but mostly maintains purposeful ambiguity. Emotional beats are shown through subtle gestures (clutching brooch, choosing fruit) rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively, but the story leans too heavily on atmospheric abstraction to compensate for truncated emotional development. The ending lingers conceptually but lacks narrative weight proportionate to its thematic ambition.</comment>
