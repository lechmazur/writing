<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes of cross-realm duty shape Seraphina's actions, but her internal conflicts remain abstract. Personality lacks dimensionality despite vivid imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Linear progression through cosmic transformation lacks meaningful conflict escalation. Exposition-as-plot overwhelms narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alien grandeur of nectar vats and bleeding walls creates compelling metaphysical atmosphere through visceral imagery and synesthetic details.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Competent synthesis of surreal elements, but thematic weight feels diffuse beneath ornate packaging. Leaves vague wonder rather than profound resonance.</comment>
