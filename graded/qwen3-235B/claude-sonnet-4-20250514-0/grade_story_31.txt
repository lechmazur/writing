<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially developed, but Marcus feels like a narrative device rather than a fully realized human. His "endearingly irritating" trait feels underexplored beyond plant conversations, and emotional transitions lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The key-driven plot progresses logically but risks feeling schematic. The cybernetic gardening concept carries the narrative, though the emotional climax could benefit from earlier seeded tensions rather than immediate community acceptance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Neon-soaked cyberpunk atmosphere effectively contrasts with organic metaphors. Sensory details about sterile air, glowing fruits, and oppressive glassdome create immersive tension between technology and nature, though some descriptions border on genre tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through metaphorical richness - digital gardens as existential connection, pulse synchronization as belonging. The theme of overlooked caretakers becomes visceral through precise imagery like "cyber-cherry" and "digital fruits glowing brighter".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic structures, though character reactions occasionally skew overly logical. Some transitions between individual gardens feel abrupt despite tight structure. Metaphors remain inventive without becoming excessive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story feels purposefully constrained yet expansive thematically. Assigned elements serve dual functions - the key unlocks both physical access and metaphorical belonging, while cyberpunk setting isn't just costume but fundamental to the narrative's dislocation theme.</comment>
