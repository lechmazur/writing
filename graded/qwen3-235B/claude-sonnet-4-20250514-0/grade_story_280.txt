<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Precision in character’s obsession with observation and solitude aligns with their role, but lacks depth in exploring contradictions—retreat vs. mastery feels under-interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot arc pivots on a single epiphany; coherence maintained through tight focus on pattern recognition, though the revelation risks feeling abrupt despite efficient pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere via crystalline migrations against cosmic void is vivid, but underused—sensory details rarely transcend visual to evoke tactile immersion in zero-gravity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thematic resonance between biological patterns and strategic wisdom is intellectually stirring, though the ending’s didactic clarity slightly softens the story’s mysterious potency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing, but the tone occasionally veers toward poetically abstract rather than precisely lyrical, risking vague “profound” affectations over concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically (brass cups as metaphor, quasar as temporal echo), though the premise’s structural elegance outpaces exploration of the character’s inner dissonance.</comment>
