<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Shallow motivation despite concept linkage; character serves plot more than embodies emotional depth. Stamp connection reveals purpose but lacks layered internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Efficient plot progression with logical cause-effect, but sudden leaps like instant scientific revelation strain credibility within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with bioluminescent details; undersea atmosphere synergizes with quantum mystery, though time compression element underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric undercurrents (stamps as maps, shifting realities), but emotional payoff remains intellectual rather than visceral. Procedural urgency dampens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but exhibits mechanical precision in some descriptions. Quantum concepts fresh, but "dissonant calm" trope feels overly calculated rather than organically haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synergy between elements justifies premise; concise execution sustains momentum, though broader implications of dimensional travel remain frustratingly underexplored.</comment>
