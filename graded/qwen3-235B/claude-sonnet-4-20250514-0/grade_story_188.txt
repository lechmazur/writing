<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (escape from violence, redemption) are clear but lack interiority; actions align with traits but could delve deeper into psychological complexity through sensory details rather than exposition</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from letter’s arrival to pottery/mending parallel, but structural progression feels overly condensed; thematic resolution arrives abruptly without earned emotional preparation</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush, precise sensory details (salt air, cherry blossoms, pottery shards as “tears”) create immersive atmosphere; setting/timeframe integration slightly uneven but visuals strongly reinforce theme of decay/rebirth</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (kintsugi, seeds, “storm” as violence) and lyrical prose elevate beyond surface narrative; some abstract emotional phrasing (“corroded rapture”) risks vagueness despite strong symbolism</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls (no “storm as inner turmoil” clichés) but occasional overdescription (“slow, sacred work of cultivation”) veers close to ornamental abstraction rather than visceral specificity</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively yet unevenly weighted; emotional resonance strong in individual moments but integration of “improbable” attribute and timeframe lacks narrative urgency needed for complete thematic payoff</comment>
