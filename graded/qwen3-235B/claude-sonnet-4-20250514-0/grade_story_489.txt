<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's 'aggressively kind' trait lacks depth beyond brief description; actions align with preserving traditions but psychological nuance feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has satisfying circularity but leans on familiar rescue tropes; pacing is efficient yet resolution feels slightly rushed within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered (salt-stained windows, whale song) though dancer/theater element remains loosely connected to core narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of analog tradition vs. digital modernity resonate through effective symbolism; emotional resonance undercut by occasional didactic tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality unevenâ€”whale's role borders on mystical arbitrariness; avoids full purple prose but some phrases ("endless performance of human existence") risk grandiosity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>All elements present but integration varies; dancer/timeframe feels contrived while lighthouse/whistle dynamics offer stronger cohesion.</comment>
