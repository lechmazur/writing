<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong central motivation but underdeveloped personal stakes; Maya's softheartedness is stated more than demonstrated through actionable conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear ritual structure with satisfying bookends, but lacks substantial middle tension; the cosmic weave progression feels overly simplistic for the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in neon/coral contrasts; the planetarium's living architecture creates compelling tension against cyberpunk sterility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mythic metaphors (fate as fabric, stories as healing agents) elevate beyond genre tropes; emotional resonance through subtle systemic change rather than grand heroism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally leans on familiar cyberpunk descriptors; emotional subtext emerges clearly despite the concept-heavy premise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Coherent but not transcendent; successfully combines elements conceptually, though the brief format prevents deeper thematic excavation required for elite distinction.</comment>
