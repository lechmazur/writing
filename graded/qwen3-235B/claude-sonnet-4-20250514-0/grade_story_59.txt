<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; emotional transformations feel abrupt. The sister's backstory is effective but lacks depth. The guitar and collar as symbols are stronger than character's interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a discernible arc (arrival - experiment - realization) but struggles with pacing within tight constraints. The ending resolves the central tension yet feels slightly rushed. Causality is logical but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully rendered - the chamber's oppressive silence creates visceral atmosphere. Sensory details (hungry walls, swallowed footsteps) enhance immersion. The timeframe's ambiguity ("silent struggles") paradoxically strengthens the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (music vs silence) and poetic metaphors elevate the narrative. The closing lines resonate thematically. Some emotional beats rely on lyrical abstraction rather than concrete action, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s with fresh metaphors ("echo chamber as cathedral of silence") and thematic depth. Occasionally indulges in ornate description ("terrible music"), but generally maintains purposeful style. Subtlety of grief handles it better than explicit declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively but unevenly. The thematic resonance of absence/silence lingers, though brevity prevents full exploration. Inventive use of scientific concepts adds uniqueness but some structural aspects feel constrained by word limit.</comment>
