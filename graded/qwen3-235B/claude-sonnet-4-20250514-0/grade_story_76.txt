<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is more symbolic than fleshed-out; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced inner conflict or growth beyond determination. Traits like "shyly unstoppable" feel superficially sketched rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but relies on magical realism to resolve stakes; cause-and-effect is soft-focused. Pacing is uneven, with the climax arriving abruptly. The constraint forces a compressed arc but not a compelling one.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterful, with rich sensory details evoking decay and ghosts of the past. However, the setting’s poetic decay occasionally overshadows plot and character, risking imbalance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and lyrical prose elevate the narrative. The theme of reclamation through imagination resonates. While emotional beats are shown, some explicit "telling" weakens subtext in places.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original in concept but veers into familiar territory (haunted places, forgotten beauty). Avoids purple prose, though "fierce repose" and "ghostly giggles" border on cliché. Style is purposeful but occasionally derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack deeper integration. The tone and imagery linger, but the story’s brevity sacrifices narrative depth and tension. Strong thematics but uneven execution.</comment>
