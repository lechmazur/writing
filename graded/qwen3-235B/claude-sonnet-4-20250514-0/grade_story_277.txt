<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's "unsure" trait is mentioned but underdeveloped; her sudden transformation from uncertain archivist to confident bearer of sparks lacks emotional groundwork, undermining character consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to revelation, but the labyrinth’s “pattern” and the mask’s activation feel contrived, weakening cause-effect cohesion within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery of crystalline gardens and shadow-drenched workshop creates vivid atmosphere; setting’s fractured, unfinished artifacts powerfully mirror the “fractured beauty” tone and thematic exploration of impermanent creation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (“metallic constellations”) and symbolic sparks add depth, but emotional impact is diluted by heavily telegraphed themes; ending resolves too neatly for literary prestige standards.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in framing inspiration as literal “sparks,” but descriptions like “captive stars” border on ornamental; labyrinth logic and sudden character resolve lean on fantasy tropes without sufficient subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story unites elements into a coherent arc, but many assigned components (e.g., “precisely playful”) are surface-level gestures rather than integral to narrative logic or thematic depth.</comment>
