<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aloofness is consistent but surface-level; emotional arc feels rushed despite thematic connection to stones and cryptic message. Internal motivations are clear but occasionally forced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coherent but compressed arc; rising tension from anomaly effectively offsets quiet beginning, yet transformation feels abrupt. Pacing strains against word limit during pivotal transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anomaly creates visual interest but underexplored atmosphere; sensory details are sparse and unevenly distributed. Gravitational effects lack full integration into setting's emotional logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones, floating) carry thematic weight, while "courage tasting like starlight" veers toward clich√©. Ending delivers modest emotional resonance through cosmic symbolism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orphan trope and "transformation through adversity" lean on recognizable patterns. Some subversion through anomaly's gentleness but occasionally crosses into purple prose territory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere functionally but not transcendentally; stones and anomaly work together conceptually yet feel like thematic cargo. Story's brevity constrains deeper integration.</comment>
