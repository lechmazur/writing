<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits (dutiful sentinel, primal sophistication) are present but underdeveloped; motivations linked to scientific devotion are clear but lack psychological nuance; nervous hair-clip habit shows ritualistic focus but feels more symbolic than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically between lab and wedding contrast, but the 500-word arc feels compressed; the action (crafting a persuasive scientific narrative) lacks tangible stakes beyond implied funding concerns; emotional resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent algae create vivid atmosphere, but wedding/research lab juxtaposition could be more sensorially distinct; "stellar radiation" applications remain abstract; the hair clip's tactile presence contrasts with sterile environment effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thematic layering of science/art interdependence works well; "cosmic heartbeat" imagery and narrative-as-discovery motif resonate subtextually; ending risks thematic on-the-nose-ness but saves itself through character gesture (untouched hair clip).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on scientist-lone-genius trope; dialogue occasionally succumbs to explanatory exposition; hair clip avoids being generic symbol through repeated physical gestures rather than overexplained significance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in practice; setting/timeframe interplay works better than metaphorical heft of hair clip or "sunrise" motif; narrative compression sacrifices emotional weight for thematic ambition in final paragraph.</comment>
