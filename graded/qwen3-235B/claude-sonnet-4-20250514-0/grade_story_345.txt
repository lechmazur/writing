<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lapsed priest's internal conflict is deeply explored, but action-reaction cycles remain overly internalized, reducing narrative urgency. Motivation to "embrace confusion" lacks concrete behavioral progression despite symbolic abacus use.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains structural integrity within limits, but key transitions (snow patterns guiding path) feel contrived rather than organic. The jog-to-climb progression shows direction but gains momentum unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hyper-sensory description of twilight-lit beanstalks creates haunting atmosphere. However, "dull radiance" tone remains under-exploited thematically, and snow's sentience contradicts established natural-unnatural balances.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical density works beautifully (abacus = quantification vs. faith). Ending's thematic punch is diluted occasionally by over-reliance on mystical descriptors that suggest depth more than they deliver.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subverts priest narrative through existential crisis rather than typical redemption tropes. Some phrases ("rebellion against path") teeter toward cliche but recover through concrete imagery like crystallized breath and broken abacus texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Ambitious theme exploration and symbolic cohesion are undercut by pacing hiccups and inconsistent magical realism logic. The final image lingers, but the journey there shows craftsmanship seams.</comment>
