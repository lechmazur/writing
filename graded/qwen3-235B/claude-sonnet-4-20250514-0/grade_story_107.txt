<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character development is mostly coherent but rushes transformation; motivations shift abruptly, relying on mystical intervention rather than organic evolution. The sequined jacket's significance feels underexplored as a symbol of fading identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure navigates tight constraints effectively but relies on convenient mechanisms (sudden fever, vanishing stranger) that strain credibility. Connections between sabotage (7E) and ultimate purpose feel forced despite functional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on evocative details (volcanic acoustics, medicinal formula etchings) but struggles with inconsistent sensory grounding. The "bitter honey" motif (7J) permeates tone without full emotional integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and symbolic depth elevate thematic resonance (crystal as truth vessel vs television's superficiality). Ending transcends redemption clich√©s through nuanced emphasis on indigenous knowledge stewardship rather than personal salvation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting castaway trope through cultural preservation lens, though "suddenly drawn" (7D) repetitions occasionally feel algorithmic. The typewriter silence (7H) metaphor works but lacks narrative weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Cohesion emerges from tight thematic focus despite high-concept elements, though pacing unevenness and mystical deus ex machina undermine full realization of literary ambition.</comment>
