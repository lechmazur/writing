<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weakness: Surreal elements strain narrative logic; circus introduction lacks grounding. Strength: Parallels between father/daughter struggles provide emotional through-line; ending offers cohesive thematic resolution despite structural fragility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Abandoned drive-in's decay mirrors Marcus' psyche; circus visuals create haunting dissonance. Weakness: Parole hearing's timeframe connection feels tenuous beyond opening line; temperature of asphalt or scent of rust could deepen sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Crystalline metaphors masterfully layer meaning; "salt gardens of resilience" exemplify precise metaphor.

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weakness: "Anguished joy" often stated rather than dramatized through action; generic "bitter sweetness" descriptors.
