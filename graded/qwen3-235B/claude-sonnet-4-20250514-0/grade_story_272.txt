<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's social awkwardness is stated rather than shown through nuanced interaction; motivation rooted in unresolved regret is clear but lacks layered exploration. The wooden whistle ties into his past but doesn't fully reflect his technical inventiveness or emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc progresses logically from research to resolution, but the integration of encrypted files within a diner setting strains credibility. Pacing is controlled within constraints, though the conclusion feels slightly forced rather than earned through earned emotional escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Diner atmosphere uses functional sensory details (humming lights, coffee refills) but struggles to reconcile high-tech decryption with rustic craftsmanship. The timeframe's isolation enhances introspection but underdevelops interactions that could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphor of recovering lost heritage is clear but lacks subtextual complexity. Recurring whistle symbolism carries thematic weight, though emotional impact remains surface-level due to limited character interiority. The ending provides closure without meaningful ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s, though the "lost wisdom rediscovered" trope is softened by blending digital/mathematical reconstruction with physical craft. Avoids purple prose but occasionally lapses into generalized descriptions instead of vivid, unexpected imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere more through thematic resonance than organic integration; the encrypted archive and late-night diner setup work but feel juxtaposed rather than interconnected. Limited by brevity but maintains structural integrity with minor tonal inconsistencies.</comment>
