<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Underdeveloped character psychology; motivations (immortality's burden, guardianship) stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior; dialogue flat; "detached devotion" of Vera feels imposed rather than naturally rendered through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Convoluted compression: pivotal discovery compressed into expository dialogue; structural coherence compromised by cramming three centuries into 500 words; abrupt pivot from journal reading to cosmic transcendence undermines gradual tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Underground setting relies on generic "echoing chambers" clich√©s; inconsistent sensory detail (e.g. "crystalline formations" glow but lack tactile/spatial description); mole people's societal logic underexplored; tone of "last ember" fatalism inconsistently maintained against clinical dialogue.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective cosmic imagery ("universe's last ember") contrasts with clinical narration to explore paradox of immortality; crystalline consciousness upload raises philosophical questions but lacks emotional heft; subtext about knowledge preservation vs. humanity's erasure is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on immortality, post-apocalyptic tropes without subversion; "digitization into stone" conceptually derivative; clinical tone unintentionally robotic (e.g., "mundanely glorious immortality" lacks emotional contradiction); overused metaphors ("echoes in stone") feel generic; emotional stakes reduced to exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Element inclusion feels mandatory rather than organic: mole people, dying universe, journals strain narrative cohesion; thematic tension between "gifted burdens" and "masters of reality" underutilized; concise format wastes potential for introspective character study.</comment>
