<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to defy finality feels consistent, but her internal conflict remains underexplored. Her actions align with her role, but her voice lacks layered nuance beyond functional narrative purpose, slightly weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves with purpose through Maya’s discoveries, but the word limit sacrifices deeper exploration of her decision’s stakes. The arc is clear, though some cause-effect threads (e.g., engine activation) feel slightly rushed despite strong momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (rust, amber-lit machinery, humming engines) vividly ground the steampunk-theatrical hybrid. The abandoned repair bay and post-curtainfall timeframe fuse seamlessly with the theme, creating a haunting, immersive atmosphere of defiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (chrysalis, goggle-enhanced perception) and layered subtext (art as rebellion) elevate impact. The ending’s emotional payoff and symbolic weight are potent, though minor “telling” (“prickly sensation”) slightly dilutes the show-don’t-tell ideal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by linking steampunk with existential defiance. Sentences avoid overt purple prose despite lush imagery. May lean slightly formulaic in its “chosen heir” motif but redeems itself through unique thematic framing (wilderness as liminality).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully integrated into a cohesive, thematically rich narrative. The brevity occasionally constrains deeper exploration but uses its scope effectively to evoke lingering wonder and thematic resonance.</comment>
