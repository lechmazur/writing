<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's fragmented psyche and 'quiet mania' are evocative, but motivation as a 'convicted dream thief' lacks concrete backstory or logical connection to her current obsession with tennis and thunder. Actions feel symbolic but insufficiently grounded in human psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from static contemplation to the plunge, but the 400-word format leaves key transitions (e.g., obsession with math, summoning thunder) underdeveloped. Tennis element feels tacked onto structure rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich (decaying treehouse, motionless wind) but sensory details are unevenâ€”lightning/thunder felt visceral, emotional elements overly abstract. The empty post-birth world needs more tangible worldbuilding beyond passive descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphorical language (e.g., "equations scattering like birds") and layered symbolism in fragmented photos aligning with her identity. Ending's thematic cohesion about chaos/falling works, though some poetic abstraction risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The story avoids predictable tropes but occasionally over-indulges in abstract phrases ("quiet madness") and strained metaphors ("mathematical chaos"). Stylistic flourishes sometimes overshadow emotional authenticity, though the thunder motif shows ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements like 'dream thief' and 'post-last-human' feel conceptually rich but thinly developed. The story creates a haunting mood and raises philosophical questions about identity, but integration of assigned elements is uneven in such a short span.</comment>
