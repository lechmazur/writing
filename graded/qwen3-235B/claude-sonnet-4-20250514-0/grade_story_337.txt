<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to preserve tradition against AI is clear and consistent with her actions, but lacks deeper exploration of personal stakes—her emotional connection to her grandmother's legacy remains hinted at rather than deeply felt. Dialogue and behavior show her mystique well, but inner conflicts remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a tight arc from Mei's preparation to the mogul's encounter, but the brevity leaves resolution feeling abrupt. The core action (writing a fortune) drives momentum, though the story's scope remains more atmospheric than plot-driven. Pacing balances tension and reflection marginally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative details—broken glass refracting light, paint-splattered walls—create a vivid, symbolic setting that mirrors the theme (broken pieces creating meaning). Sensory immersion is strong, particularly in contrasting the mogul's slick modernity with the studio's decay. Atmosphere supports the theme of fragmented yet meaningful existence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skillful literary devices like the kaleidoscope metaphor and fortune-cookie symbolism enrich subtext. The theme of tradition vs. technology is sharply conveyed through contrasts—human intuition vs. AI, fractured glass vs. cohesive patterns. Dialogue is minimal but resonant, ending with lingering tension between control and chance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging mahjong tiles and AI prophesying, avoiding clichés through specific cultural details rather than generic "magic vs. tech" tropes. The prose is precise without florid excess, and the fortune's cryptic wisdom feels authentic rather than formulaic. The mogul's skeptical modernity contrasts meaningfully with Mei's inherited mystique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements cohere around the theme, though some feel conceptually prioritized over emotional resonance. The 500-word structure serves the "snapshot" quality, leaving room for reflection. The combination of mahjong, kaleidoscopes, and fortune cookies demonstrates creative synergy, culminating in a layered meditation on futurism and preservation.</comment>
