<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Reveals motivation clearly but leans on repetition of 'sometimes always' as a crutch rather than organic characterization. Emotional stakes implied more than earned, with compassionate drive occasionally feeling narratively imposed rather than demonstrated through nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression executed efficiently within word constraints, but compressed timeline flattens tension. Revelation-as-hinge lacks sufficient setup, while survival skills' application feels expedient rather than methodical. Pacing prioritizes momentum over emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival offers visceral decay through tactile details (groaning tracks, metallic clangs), but relies on genre clichés. Setting's duality between realms remains conceptually interesting yet underdeveloped—liminality feels more atmospheric than thematic. Shadows lack ecological integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery in astral-physical duality and key's metaphysical resonance elevates impact. Subtext about anchors and liminality emerges powerfully despite brevity. Occasional heavy-handedness ("unyielding compassion") and 'show-don't-tell' imbalances prevent higher score.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mixed originality—astral projector/survival skill premise refreshingly restrained, but 'sometimes always' repetition betrays algorithmic patterning rather than organic prose. Compassion as stated theme lacks psychological nuance. Sensory details occasionally default to expected descriptors (twisted metal, dying light) rather than specific invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements superficially unified but mechanically interconnected. Conceptual scaffolding dominates over organic emotional progression. Tight constraints showcase plot efficiency but sacrifice thematic heft. Lingering questions about astral mechanics feel structural omissions rather than intentional ambiguities.</comment>
