<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to uncover her grandmother's work drives the narrative, but her guarded nature remains superficially sketched without deep internal conflict or vulnerability. Her transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through layered emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from haunted apothecary to revelation, but the dream-analysis method relies on passive exposition rather than active discovery. Pacing works within constraints but feels slightly compressed during the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The power plant's fusion of industrial decay and mystical energy creates rich atmosphere with sensory details (humming machinery, dusty herbs). The timeframe device (rocking chair) adds subtle temporal texture but isn't fully leveraged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "hum of humility" conceit offers thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by over-explanation rather than organic revelation. Metaphors sing strongest in physical descriptions (seashell's spirals) rather than introspection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines mystical artifact quests with intergenerational legacy tropes in a familiar but serviceable way. The fusion of electromagnetic science and herbalism has potential, but the "hum of humility" concept feels conceptually underdeveloped and didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but occasionally functionalâ€”some details feel like checkmarks (nightmare visions as exposition) rather than organic story threads. The ending suggests deeper exploration was possible within the constraints.</comment>
