<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is hinted but remains vague; her paradoxical trait is superficially explored. Mira's actions show resolve but lack emotional depth or evolution beyond thematic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves cohesion through metaphorical progression, but pacing leans on abstract epiphany over concrete progression. The core action feels condensed to the point of underdevelopment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and thematically resonant, with hauntingly rendered sensory details. The acid-scarred forest enhances the narrative's philosophical undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Literary devices (puzzle pieces as metaphor) are effective but undercut by didactic exposition. Subtext is clear but lacks lingering emotional resonance; themes are stated more than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Some originality in combining postapocalyptic motifs with philosophical inquiry, but relies on familiar tropes (wise monarch, animal guide). Metaphors border on abstraction without organic emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story integrates elements thematically but occasionally feels concept-driven. The abrupt shift from collection to revelation sacrifices nuance, though the core metaphor lingers.</comment>
