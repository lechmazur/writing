<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Lack of traditional character development; motivations are clear but abstract rather than embodied through organic actions. His swordsman identity is superficial and disconnected from his philosophical epiphany.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Presentation of an internal epiphany as "plot" lacks conventional dramatic tension but fulfills the constraint through thematic resolution. Narrative flow is disrupted by excessive abstraction and lack of sequential causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally distant. Petrified forest's symbiotic relationship to the schematic's patterns deepens thematic resonance, though sensory details occasionally verge on overwrought metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional interplay of lyrical prose, recursive imagery, and thematic paradox. Conceptual depth regarding consciousness-as-pattern-resonance lingers in the mind, though emotional impact is intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasional flashes of originality undercut by stylistic excesses ("stone rings revealing millennia of growth") and philosophical generalizations that feel borrowed rather than earned through character embodiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic skeleton exists beneath poetic shell, but characterization and plot remain underdeveloped for broad market viability. Lingering questions outweighed by concerns about accessibility.</comment>
