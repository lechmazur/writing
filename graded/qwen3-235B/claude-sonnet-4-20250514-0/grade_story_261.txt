<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uncommon fusion of quantum physics with horticulture avoids tropes; some phrases flirt with purple prose ("rigidly flexible heart") but overall maintains stylistic control and emotional texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements like "quantum shadows" and memory-as-solution demonstrate inventive interplay; economy of language enhances rather than limits thematic depth; leaves lingering questions about salvation's cost.</comment>
