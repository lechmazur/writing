<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (preservation of tradition) is present but not fully grounded in emotional nuance, with some traits feeling assigned rather than organically explored through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing meanders rather than progressing a plot; the beginning/end connection relies on thematic repetition rather than narrative development, with the story functioning more as vignette than structured arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (paint fumes, brass tape's patina, jeweled fingers) create immersive atmosphere, though the modern-digital/ancient-tradition contrast occasionally feels under-clarified rather than intentionally juxtaposed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery (digital memorials vs. tarnished brass) creates layered subtext about legacy, but emotional impact is muted by over-reliance on declarative statements about "joy" and "sorrow" rather than subtextual embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends modern funeral practices with mystical tradition creatively but leans into ornate descriptions that occasionally verge on purple prose, with some emotional beats feeling curated rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successfully coalesces assigned elements into a thematically coherent piece that lingers on legacy vs. modernity, though tighter integration of components (particularly digital aspects) could enhance resonance.</comment>
