<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters possess surface-level complexity; motivations (documenting patterns, unspoken connection) drive action but lack psychological depth; interactions are poetic but occasionally feel performative rather than viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear progression exists (from observation to connection), but the tight word limit creates slight tonal whiplash when shifting from archival themes to romantic resolution; cause/effect relationship between documentation and action remains somewhat abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory language (smoke-stained timber, trapped insects in amber) merges historical and contemporary elements beautifully; atmosphere occasionally verges on self-indulgence but effectively mirrors characters' liminality between past and present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as prehistoric archive, wine as possibility) resonate powerfully; ending avoids melodrama while resolving emotional stakes; tension between passive observation and participation has philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés (e.g., Vikings as brutish warriors), but "fierce repose" and unspoken love trope follow familiar emotional contours; imagery occasionally becomes overly ornate but largely serves thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist cohesively but don’t fully synergize; brevity serves poetic tone but weakens stakes; memorable for atmosphere/concept more than narrative urgency or emotional rawness.</comment>
