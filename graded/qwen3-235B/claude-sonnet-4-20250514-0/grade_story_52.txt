<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is clear but thinly developed; her abrupt shift from “blithe discontent” to emotional investment in the merchant feels contrived. While her father’s legacy drives the plot, her reaction to the ghostly figures lacks psychological nuance, reducing complex emotions to sudden exposition rather than earned transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing struggles under the word limit: the ghostly materialization and emotional climax feel rushed. The resolution through a karaoke duet introduces whimsy that jars with the darker themes of class oppression and grief, undermining narrative cohesion. Cause-and-effect between the sharpener’s reveal and the merchant’s redemption lacks sufficient groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The hourglass setting’s visual potential (e.g., “sand falling like an eternal hourglass”) isn’t deeply woven into the thematic fabric. Sensory details (e.g., “whisper of descending grains”) create atmosphere but fail to concretely enhance tension or character decisions; the setting operates more as backdrop than active participant in the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The karaoke duet and spectral materialization lean on whimsical tropes without subversion, evoking a sitcom-like tone that undermines the story’s emotional stakes. Over-reliance on metaphors (“souls as sand”) and overt descriptions (“hope as persistent as sand”) lean toward purple prose. The central conflict resolves too neatly, prioritizing message over organic development.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements feel intermittently forced: the hourglass setting, while vivid, doesn’t organically drive the plot or themes; the fading chalk lines are mentioned but never meaningfully expanded. The core concept of devotion shapes Maya’s actions but lacks layered exploration of how such devotion manifests in daily struggle versus grand gesture. The ending’s sentiment is satisfying but structurally shallow.</comment>
