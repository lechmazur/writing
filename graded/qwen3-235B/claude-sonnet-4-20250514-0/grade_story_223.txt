<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but thinly developed; the protagonist’s immortality and guilt are hinted at but lack emotional depth. The awkwardly charming trait feels underutilized beyond surface dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on abrupt causality (e.g., orchid dissolving leads to transformation). Pacing is hurried, and the tight word limit sacrifices nuanced turning points. The moon-phase mechanic feels tacked on rather than integral to the story’s momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is rich in sensory detail (crystal walls, rainbow canyon) but logically disjointed—how does a fortress tied to traded secrets function? Atmosphere overshadows plausibility, though it effectively mirrors the protagonist’s internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through themes of self-forgiveness and belonging. Symbolism (mirror, orchid) and subtext (homesickness as punishment) elevate the narrative. Ending resonates as both cathartic and thematically coherent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on abstract phrasing ("nostalgic defiance") that borders on pretentious. Imagery is vivid and original, though the mirror’s chorus of voices feels derivative. Emotional restraint is mostly well-balanced, with minimal telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven (seasickness as metaphor, traded secrets as plot mechanism), though some feel contrived (ghost orchid’s moonlight-gathering logic). The constrained length sharpens the narrative’s emotional core while sacrificing secondary worldbuilding.</comment>
