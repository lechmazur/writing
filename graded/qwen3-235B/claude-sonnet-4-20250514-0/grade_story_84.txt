<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sebastian's transformation from performative to genuine kindness provides basic arc, but underdeveloped interiority prevents full emotional investment. Dramatic traits occasionally feel contrived rather than organically tied to his redemption.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight cause-effect through riddle-solving sustains momentum. Some structural compromise from tight word count - the Eternal Merchant's introduction and defeat feel compressed rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Promising elements of shell-paved streets and turtle heartbeat sensory details, but setting remains superficially rendered. The frenzied tranquility of sidewalk sales lacks sustained atmospheric development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (living shell as community bonds) and subtext about authentic connection. Ending's philosophical weight resonates, though some themes stated overtly rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original turtle-shell cosmology and riddle mechanics avoid complete formulaic repetition, but reliance on "redemption through community" trope and personified evil falls short of radical reinvention. Overly frequent adverbial descriptions occasionally emerge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally feel checklist-derived rather than organically integrated (particularly riddles/commercials). The turtle-city connection holds conceptual vibrancy despite executional limitations.</comment>
