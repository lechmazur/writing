<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Poor development of inner conflict; motivation implied but lacks textured vulnerability beyond obsessive quest for transcendence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Visually coherent arc but underdeveloped cause-effect; the riddle's "solution" feels narratively abrupt rather than earned through earlier setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse provides clever juxtaposition (innocence vs. obsession), but sensory details remain surface-level; frost vs. mirror light could have been more visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose elevates abstract themes, but emotional connection to character remains thin; ending resonates conceptually more than emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in conceptual fusion (mirror divination + Arctic setting) but risks generic magic-system tropes; some "purple patches" in descriptive passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Polished execution with striking images, but thematic execution (transcendence through dissolution) feels conceptually familiar rather than revelatory.</comment>
