<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (inherited trauma, vigilante impulse) are emotionally resonant but underdeveloped; Marcus' internal conflict between silence and revelation lacks visceral specificity; interactions with the assigned "villainous" trait feel underexplored metaphor rather than lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Narrative drifts between vignette and arc; warping light as plot device feels disconnected from linear progression; while atmospheric cohesion exists, the story's shape within word constraints feels circumstantial rather than deliberate; resolution is elliptical to the point of disengagement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Abandoned airport setting merged with digital disconnection creates haunting liminal space; sensory details (worn bead, pixelated faces) vividly materialize emotional decay; warped mirror's physical description particularly powerful in its collision of innocence and ruin.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors have conceptual heft (distorted reflections as transgenerational trauma) but occasionally slip into portentous abstraction; ending resonates intellectually but lacks physicality; thematic throughline (truth in brokenness) competently maintained but could have deeper emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but treads familiar ground in trauma-as-mystical-perception; the glass as truth-reveal trope is serviceably subverted; language remains purposeful with occasional flourishes; emotional undercurrent feels genuine despite metaphysical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic unity despite constrained form; assigned elements serve as poetic scaffolding without overwhelming narrative; tone and structure maintain disciplined integrity; leaves lingering impression akin to an elegy, though with limited emotional penetration.</comment>
