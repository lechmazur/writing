<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains static, defined more through poetic descriptors than internal depth or evolution; motivations hinted at through actions but lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Narrative flows cohesively from disillusionment to epiphany; however, the compressed arc feels schematic rather than organic within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Imagery of floating lounge contrasted with decaying city creates rich atmosphere; sensory details (starlight-and-regret drink) and tone (melancholy elegance) immerse effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (broken watch = fractured time; gardens = boundaries as sanctuary) is potent; lyrical prose elevates thematic depth about meaning in liminality, though ending leans precious.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some metaphors (constellation-photos) and atmospheric elements feel fresh, but the minstrel's archetypal role and "hope from photos" premise border on aestheticized clich√© rather than emotionally grounded originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements interweave thematically but occasionally strain plausibility (floating lounge's existence logic); brevity works for mood but leaves emotional impact slightly thin despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
