<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits like fear of ordinariness are stated but lack nuanced behavioral consequences; the zealotry and vulnerability feel conceptually clear but psychologically underexplored, relying more on declarative revelations than organic behavior shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Arc from obsession to humility exists but pivotal "understanding" moment is rushed; cause-effect between whispered confessions and jungle's response lacks intermediate logic, sacrificing narrative momentum despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting's synesthetic details (luminescent beetles, sprouting mushrooms) create immersive cognitive dissonance; the atmosphere's entropic beauty compellingly embodies the theme but occasionally succumbs to ornate excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of paradoxical symbolism (bottle cap as sacred object) and metaphorical resonance, though introspective monologue occasionally veers into self-congratulatory abstraction; ending achieves emotional closure but lacks subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric originality undercut by tropes (academic descent into madness, "wisdom from nature"); some phrases ("symphony of insects") feel over-familiar; philosophical insights lack grittily specific emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere around theme but unevenly integrated; brevity serves transformation arc imperfectly, with some conceptual shortcuts (abrupt "understanding" moment); lingering questions about meaning remain deliberate but unevenly weighted.</comment>
