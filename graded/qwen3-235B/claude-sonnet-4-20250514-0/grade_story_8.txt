<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character exhibits consistent motivation but lacks depth; traits are present yet underdeveloped. The dazed state feels more like aesthetic than psychological truth, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum. The inciting action lacks stakes and resolution feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically earned within the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create a haunting atmosphere, though the composer's garden occasionally feels more symbolic than visceral. Some descriptions border on excessive without deepening spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic fusion of math/divinity create intellectual resonance. Undermined slightly by occasional over-reliance on lyrical abstraction over concrete emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids direct tropes through mathematical mysticism but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing that obscures meaning. The cosmic dance motif is original yet occasionally veers into vague poeticizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition and thematic cohesion outweigh minor structural flaws. Elements work collectively but occasionally strain under the weight of their abstraction, needing stronger anchoring.</comment>
