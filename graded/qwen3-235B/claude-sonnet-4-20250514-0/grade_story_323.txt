<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's whimsy drives actions, but lacks psychological depth; motivation to collect sacred items feels underexplored despite thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows an arc of collection to realization, but lacks urgency; connections between shoelace, seeds, and enlightenment feel loosely threaded within tight constraints.</comment>
