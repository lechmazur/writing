<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rapid transformation feels undermotivated; character's poetic vulnerability lacks foundation in prior narrative. Scorching poise reeks of authorial imposition rather than organic self-presentation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative engine (dummy's command) propels plot, but structural momentum sacrificed through static dialogue-driven middle. Resolution feels preordained by genre convention rather than earned logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vague haunted machinery noises and "spectral" descriptors create more atmosphere than actual lived-in worldbuilding. Sensory palette remains disappointingly abstract, relying on clich√©d maritime decay rather than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphor of lighthouse as voice for the forgotten offers poignant undercurrent, undercut by didactic delivery. Mechanical transformation trope gains momentary vitality through bodily dummy descriptions but collapses under thematic overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>Unearned mystical awakening reeks of procedural plotting rather than human complexity. Purple prose ("scorching poise," "cynical armor") mar otherwise lean prose. Subtext remains prison-bound by its own explicitness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Makes admirable attempt at thematic unity within constraints, though contrived epiphany diminishes emotional gravity. Certain elements (poetry method) strain cohesion, while the dummy's pulse of "wooden heart" betrays anthropomorphic sentimentality.</grade>
