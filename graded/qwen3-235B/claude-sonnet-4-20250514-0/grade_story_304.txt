<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation for an assassin; emotional pivot relies on vague backstory rather than lived-in conflict. The child's dialogue feels manipulative rather than organically humanizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure strained by word limit; sudden shift from vengeance to redemption lacks incremental tension. Final image resolves the arc visually but not thematically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Baroque decay juxtaposed with industrial grit creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory details like "gilded details" and "vaulted chamber acoustics" organically expand the world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some striking metaphors diluted by occasional clich√©s ("silver bells"). Emotional beats like the child's dialogue risk sentimentality rather than earned pathos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High concept density nearly collapses under its own weight but achieves cohesion through atmospheric consistency. The assassin-with-a-conscience trope shows flashes of innovation.</comment>
