<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct contradictions (humorless comedian writing poetry) and generational tension, but motivations tied to "objectively personal" feel slightly underdeveloped despite poignant interactions with the inkwell.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot uses cyclical daydreams effectively but risks episodic disjointedness due to brevity; concession arc is clear but lacks physical stakes to ground metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory details (rusted chains, frost smells) and symbolic contrasts between wilderness/civilization, but cosmic imagery occasionally feels superimposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (stars/comedy timing), thematic cohesion around preserving impermanence, and emotionally resonant ending elevate the narrative despite some overt thematicalizing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evades many tropes through cosmic-poetic fusion but occasionally slips into grandiose abstractions ("entropy mathematics") that dilute emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>Elements mostly serve theme but strain under precise 7-part assignment; some forced connections (e.g., "bottle dying breath" to starlight) weaken narrative integration.</grade>
