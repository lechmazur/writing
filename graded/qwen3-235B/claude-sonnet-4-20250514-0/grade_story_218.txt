<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Some introspective depth but relies too heavily on stating Marcus's isolation rather than integrating it organically through his interactions with the board games and setting. The motivation to "shadowbox with personal demons" feels underdeveloped beyond surface description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc but pacing feels rushed in the final transformation. The metaphysical activation of the clock tower strains logic as cause-and-effect relationships between Marcus’s creativity and supernatural elements remain under-articulated, disrupting coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered in isolated moments (clock tower mechanics, phantom ticket textures), but spatial and temporal continuity within the "forgotten clock tower" setting lacks consistency, diluting the metaphysical implications of the "metaphysically physical" space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Attempts thematic resonance through metaphor but leans too heavily on exposition to convey Marcus’s internal growth. The ending resolves cleanly yet feels emotionally schematic, relying on the "creative salvation" trope rather than earned transformation. Shows (e.g., dissolving ticket) undercut by tells ("finally understanding...").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Contains original premise but softens its edges with familiar motifs (isolated genius, magical self-realization). Phrases like "shadowboxing with personal demons" and "metaphysically physical" border on cliché as conceptual crutches rather than fresh ideas. Emotional beats lean on conventional beats rather than nuanced vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists at a plot level, but the framework of "assigned elements" (improv show, shifting dates) feels arbitrary rather than organic. Conceptual ambition lingers in themes but execution adheres too closely to predictable redemption templates to fully capitalize on its imaginative potential.</comment>
