<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but could deepen the connection between nobility backstory and current choices. The mechanical witness allows for introspection but lacks emotional nuance in processing guilt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot arc from silence to confession is coherent, though the tension between texts drives urgency. Pacing works within constraints, but the combustion's symbolic progression feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lab’s sterile flames contrast with Evelyn’s turmoil effectively. Sensory details (crinkled stubs, hummingbird’s rhythm) enhance immersion, but the nobility’s downfall lacks tangible historical texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Symbolism-rich storytelling (burning lies, mechanical witnesses) elevates the theme. Subtext about courage through destruction resonates, though some emotional beats lean on exposition rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in combining futurism (drone) with nobility’s decay is strong. Avoids cliché, though a few phrases (“cleanse with fire”) border on overused. Emotional arc shows human complexity rather than algorithmic logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements synergize well: the combustion lab literalizes thematic destruction, ticket stubs structure introspection. The text-message framing device creates urgency rather than feeling restrictive.</comment>
