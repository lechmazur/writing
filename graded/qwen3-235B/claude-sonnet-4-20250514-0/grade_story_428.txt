<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's duality is clear but transformation lacks layered reasoning; emotions stated rather than shown through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but resolution feels abrupt; concept shapes the deal but pacing falters under word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Idealized descriptions trump visceral details; atmosphere evokes decay but setting feels generic rather than specifically Indian temple-rooted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (tectonic plates, broken stars) and theme of redemption through action provide depth; underdelivers emotional resonance through telling vs. showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subverts survivalist tropes but relies on predictable contrasts (walls vs. bridges); occasional purple prose ("fire through dry timber") undermines authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cohesive on a surface level but thematic elements (ink blotter's reborn symbolism) feel schematic rather than organically integrated.</comment>
