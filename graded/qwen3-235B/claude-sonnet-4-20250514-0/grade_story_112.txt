<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation as a preserver of recipes is clear but lacks psychological complexity; her transformation from aimless to purposeful feels underdeveloped despite strong emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot has structural coherence but relies on a sudden, unearned epiphany; pacing is uneven, with the archival discovery resolving tension too neatly within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust motes, light, handkerchief) create atmospheric immersion, though the archive setting remains generic—its potential as a thematic space is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphors (e.g., hopscotch as encoded knowledge), but some heavy-handedness in explicitly stating themes like "cultural erasure" weakens subtextual depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in premise but suffers from ornate phrasing ("snowflake melts on warm skin") and over-idealized cultural preservation tropes; emotional beats often told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>The story connects assigned elements cohesively but leans on sentimental closure; the brevity works for urgency, yet the narrative’s ambition occasionally outpaces its execution.</grade>
