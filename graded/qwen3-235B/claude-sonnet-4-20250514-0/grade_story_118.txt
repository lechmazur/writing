<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Main character feels conceptually interesting but lacks interiority; cadets reduced to trauma tropes with no agency or evolution beyond reactions to visual stimuli.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression exists but feels structurally generic; ritual format saves coherence, but pacing drags during individualized grief scenes without meaningful escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory descriptors create atmosphere, but setting remains a vague "spy school with candles"; fails to interrogate the paradox of militarized therapy spaces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (charger as connection/betrayal, wax as memory) are elegantly deployed, though emotional beats occasionally verge on melodramatic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls, but "uniformly peculiar" feels like forced worldbuilding insertion; emotional subtext remains surface-level through second-person abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative weight; relies on poetic resonance compensating for underdeveloped character psychology.</comment>
