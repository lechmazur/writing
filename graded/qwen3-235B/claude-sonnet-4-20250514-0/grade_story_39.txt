<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Matthias' motivation for revolution feels archetypal despite surface-level hints of inspiration from detective novels; his "restless" nature is shown through actions but lacks psychological nuance. Dialogue with Dr. Chen reveals deception but fails to establish a distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression from preparation to impending action is logically structured but compressed; the corporate inspection catalyst feels underdeveloped. Pacing maintains momentum but sacrifices emotional resonance in quieter moments like the lantern's symbolic death.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mars biodome's decaying atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (groaning metal, dye-smelling air) and visual contrasts between synthetic fabrics/failed technology. The dying lantern's symbolism as Earth's broken promise effectively permeates the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subtext shines through metaphors (stitchwork as rebellion, clothing as forbidden communication) and haunting imagery (books as "abandoned literature"). The ending's restrained hope balances tension between vulnerability and defiance with poetic force.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imagery occasionally veers into familiar sci-fi tropes (dying systems, oppressed colonists) but recovers with inventive details (biomechanical garments, lantern-flicker circuitry). Some emotional beats rely on explicit description ("desperate hope") rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively interweaves espionage and existential struggle within tight constraints. The Martian setting serves thematic weight rather than feeling like genre checkbox-ticking. Lingering questions remain about secondary elements' necessity to the arc.</comment>
