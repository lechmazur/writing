<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but underexplored; internal conflict of diluted magic is hinted but lacks nuanced emotional depth. Dialogue feels more thematic mouthpiece than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot resolution feels rushed; the emotional arc is compressed, making the climax less earned. Connection between realms' revival lacks structural reinforcement through secondary character beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create atmosphere, but cosmic timeframe element feels disconnected. Fairy realm's decay and theme park decay are thematically linked but underdeveloped in their interdependence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical use of fire/ice duality and fan as symbol. Ending resonates with theme but relies on overly literal dialogue to convey message rather than subtextual nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some tropes (dying monarch, magic through love) are softened by the unique fairy-hybrid setting. Emotional beats occasionally veer toward didacticism, and cosmic elements feel generically deployed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Most elements are integrated cohesively, though the "cosmic possibility" timeframe remains underutilized. The concise length works for emotional punch but sacrifices deeper character investment.</grade>
