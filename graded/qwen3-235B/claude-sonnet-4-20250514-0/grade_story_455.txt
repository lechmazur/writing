<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's disgruntlement and inherited duty create compelling tension, but emotional evolution feels slightly rushed. Internal conflict is implied but lacks nuanced shading.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Efficient plot compression within constraints; the coin-shadow revelation to escape-route activation is logically cohesive, but storm/scapegoat motifs feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends melancholy and clandestine history effectively, but sensory details lean on familiar descriptors (storm metaphors, ghosts) rather than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic interplay between scars/ghosts and legacy themes. Ending delivers emotional payoff through action rather than reflection, sacrificing some depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh ideas (currency-as-code) and genre tropes (secret agent tunnels). Shadow-pattern decoding strains plausibility; emotional arcs sometimes flattened by expository narration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade>  
<comment>Conceptual integration mostly successful but unevenâ€”coins/ghosts/legacy work synergistically; escape-route mechanics feel inserted rather than organically embedded.</comment>
