<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kenji's late-blooming nature and motivation are well-defined, but his "gentle swordsman" trait is stated more than shown, and his emotional reactions lack subtlety despite logical consistency in his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with cause-effect clarity (sundial leads to chamber), but pivotal moments (descent to lab, device activation) feel rushed, lacking tension despite inventive use of assigned action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from moonlit dinosaur skeletons and cryptic shadows, but the museum setting remains superficial—no meaningful connection between prehistoric fossils and cosmic themes is explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("geometric poetry," "infinite responsibility") elevate the narrative; theme of late-blooming purpose resonates, though emotional resonance is diluted by frequent abstractions over concrete characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, concise language avoids purple prose, and subversion of "ancient artifact" tropes with cosmic alignment adds freshness. However, the museum setting lacks originality, and character psychology feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>While tightly paced and conceptually ambitious, the story sacrifices deeper character exploration and world-building for brevity. Its thematic weight (“rebellion against time”) lingers, but integration of elements is uneven.</comment>
