<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motives are logically connected but occasionally veer into melodrama; the eulogy method cleverly reflects her artistry but backstory exposition feels slightly utilitarian.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherent progression from preparation to execution, but the compressed format leaves emotional impact of her larger arc underdeveloped; pacing is controlled yet lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sensory details create an immersive, ironic atmosphere; the water clock's mechanical precision contrasts beautifully with her secret work, though the moss-covered lantern's bloodstained history could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (dying clockwork, stained velvet) elevates the narrative; the eulogies' subtextual revelations create haunting duality, though the ending feels slightly static rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in eulogy-as-weapon, but recurring metaphors occasionally border on overused (broken beauty, artful vengeance); emotional nuance in her craft exceeds generic revenge tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion outweighs contrivance; every element serves moral ambiguity exploration, though brevity limits deeper philosophical engagement with justice-as-art concept.</comment>
