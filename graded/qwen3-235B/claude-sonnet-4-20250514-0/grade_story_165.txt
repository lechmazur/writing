<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains vaguely sketched despite central role; traits like "gentle" and reactions to butterfly fragments lack psychological depth or personal stakes beyond surface-level motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but compressed; butterfly's restoration drives momentum, but condensed time jumps between discovery, assembly, and resurrection strain narrative weight and emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative visuals (crystalline walls, luminescent flora) create strong atmosphere, but cultural context for dwarves and their exodus feels underdeveloped, weakening emotional resonance with their plight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resurrection imagery and justice-as-renewal theme convey emotional heft; "joyful terror" framing provides poignant tension, though some passages lean on descriptive saturation over earned subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in butterfly symbolism and dwarf tropes but relies on "magic fixes all" resolution that feels narratively simplistic despite lyrical prose; tone consistency maintained with minor lapses into ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Storytelling shows ambition and thematic cohesion (truth/light/rebirth) but struggles under word constraints; elements combine purposefully yet lack room for deeper exploration of cultural or metaphysical implications.</comment>
