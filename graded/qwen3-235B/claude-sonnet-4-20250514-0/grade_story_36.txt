<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are implied but lack necessary emotional depth; shifts between roles (doomsayer to guardian) feel underdeveloped; the nephew functions only as symbolic baggage, never a fully-realized presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear progression from prediction to action exists, but the train whistle's narrative function feels superficial; resolution feels somewhat artificially imposed within the word constraint rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sensory details create an immersive steampunk atmosphere; contrast between decay and rebirth works emotionally; tone maintains consistency between Ezra's melancholy and machinery's mechanical rhythm.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor of restoring stickers without erasing wear achieves thematic resonance; ending avoids sentimentality while maintaining thematic clarity; emotional subtext implied through objects rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mixes strong mechanical imagery with philosophical weight; avoids most genre templates; some conceptual language ("gods of stagnation") borders on abstraction; maintains stylistic balance without artificial complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive thematic ecosystem rather than checklist; brevity serves the character study focus; leaves lingering questions about intergenerational cycles of cynicism and hope.</comment>
