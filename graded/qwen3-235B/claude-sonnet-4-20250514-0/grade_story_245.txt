<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strength in linking her smuggling background to rebellious quest, but motivation remains surface-level; emotional conflict hinted but underdeveloped through action alone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear trajectory from tea-reading to waterfall discovery, but maintenance shaft descent feels compressed; cause-effect tight but lacks atmospheric pacing in key transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rust-choked duracrete, mineral-scented decay, and broken pipes create a haunted, tactile world where water's rebellion gains visceral resonance; atmosphere transcends setting to become thematic anchor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (chopstick as ancestral bridge, unregulated waterfall as freedom) offer depth; ending's quiet revolution resonates, though "biting sincerity" occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction over embodied emotion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through specific cultural accretion (Martian mystic, grandfather's bamboo), but "heart's revolt" phrasing and "unregulated beauty" concept flirt with genre clich√©s; emotional registers could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements (chopstick, tea divination) serve thematic coherence rather than feeling arbitrarily applied; ending's philosophical weight unevenly balanced against physical journey's economy.</comment>
