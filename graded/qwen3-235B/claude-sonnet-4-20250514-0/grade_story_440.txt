<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character hints at depth through actions and vow, but lacks background to fully crystallize his shift from swordsman to art steward. Motivation is clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure with beginning (mural completion), middle (collage assembly), and end (artist’s reaction). Pacing is efficient but slightly rushed in resolving Kael’s internal arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting’s futuristic recyclers and untranslated text build mood, but the city remains underdeveloped. Sensory details are evocative but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (sea pottery, “hidden architecture of inspiration”) and circular ending elevate the theme. Emotion is shown through action, but some ideas lean abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story avoids formulaic tropes. Language is purposeful with minimal ornamentation. Offers fresh take on creation/destruction interplay. Free of predictable AI patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements weave cohesively into a thematically rich narrative. Short length feels intentional, though structural elegance slightly overshadows emotional weight.</comment>
