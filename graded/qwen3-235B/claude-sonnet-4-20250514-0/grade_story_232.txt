<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth; traits like exhaustion and obsession are shown but not deeply grounded in nuanced behavior. Motivation to decode the inscriptions is established but remains plot-driven rather than psychologically complex. The use of coffee grounds as a decoding tool doesn’t reveal significant character layers—feels more like a plot device than personal revelation. Consistency in her scholarly rigor vs. sudden epiphany is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Solid three-act compression within word limits: setup (exhausted scholar), inciting incident (coffee grounds), climax (revelation/call to action). The coffee-ground method stretches plausibility but establishes internal logic. Connections between inscriptions and cutlass lack gradual buildup—resolution comes swiftly, risking underdeveloped cause-effect chain. Pacing manages tension effectively despite constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Evocative details like "pre-dawn darkness" and swirling coffee grounds create strong visual motifs, but the digital nomad camp remains a generic, underutilized backdrop—could be any remote work environment. Atmosphere blends archaeological mystery with modern transient loneliness, but time frame phrasing ("across hush of horizon’s edge") disrupts immersion with poetic vagueness. Cultural specificity of Mayan inscriptions isn’t matched by setting depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "coffee as oracle" and water-as-communication are striking, but emotional beats rely on abstract descriptions ("quietly dramatic resurrection") rather than visceral, grounded reactions. Ending achieves thematic closure (unfinished tales completed) but lacks lingering resonance. The "destiny" realization feels sentimental rather than earned through prior action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tics—no extreme purple prose, logical progression—but relies on familiar "scholar deciphers ancient riddle" tropes without subversion. The coffee motif is somewhat fresh, but Mayan ruins/Spanish conquest elements feel rehearsed. Sensory details (cold coffee, fraying tent fabric) are specific but sparse. Character reasoning follows "eureka" formula without authentic human hesitation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but lack alchemy—coffee grounds feel tacked onto digital nomad setting rather than organically integrated. Brief length works against deeper exploration of themes like technology vs. ancient knowledge. The expedition conclusion satisfies plot logic but offers minimal narrative surprise. Lingering impact comes more from premise than execution.</comment>
