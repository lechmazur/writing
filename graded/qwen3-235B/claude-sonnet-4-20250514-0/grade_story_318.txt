<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character's aloofness feels superficial, with insufficient interiority to explain contradictory motivations. The shift from halfhearted to resolute occurs without credible emotional catalysts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows predictable "last hope" trajectory, but compression creates inconsistencies. The neural storm's threat functions more as plot device than organically developed conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting lacks thematic anchoring. The "architecture of the mind" operates as aesthetic rather than psychological/spatial logic. Sensory details feel decorative rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story effectively blends metaphorical resonance (love as defense mechanism) with emotional progression. Ending's thematic conclusion feels earned if familiar, though some emotive passages border on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Relies on well-worn "mundane object with hidden power" trope with minimal subversion. Some atmospheric passages exhibit AI-generated "neurological romanticism" tendencies; emotional complexity often implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution. Assigned elements function more as checklist items than integrated components; the "memory crystal library" and neural storm feel like borrowed scaffolding rather than organic setting.</comment>
