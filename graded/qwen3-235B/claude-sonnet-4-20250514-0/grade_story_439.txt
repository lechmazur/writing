<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sparse character voice undermines silent protagonist's depth despite atmospheric gestures toward curiosity and solitude. Mute character trait remains underutilized dramatic potential due to lack of internal conflict or vocal absence consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Storm-battered opera house provides evocative decay imagery but fails to leverage setting's narrative history - ghost ships, past performances remain decorative rather than thematic.

Character motivation shows human nuance through silent determination rather than stated emotions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Compelling synthesis of atmospheric dread and metaphysical wonder demonstrates story-first approach over element checklist. Final image of portal transition delivers haunting closure despite structural constraints.</comment>
