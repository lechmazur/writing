<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Initial arrogance is clear, but transformation feels rushed despite dialogue with others; motivations shift but lack deep exploration of internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear structure from denial to awakening, but pacing uneven; abrupt shifts in revelation weaken tension, ending feels incomplete within constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements feel purposeful but sometimes strained; premise executed cleanly within constraints, but final impact doesn't transcend genre boundaries.</comment>
