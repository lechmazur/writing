<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (star vengeance) is clear but psychological complexity feels artificially imposed rather than organically developed through concrete actions; the shift from saboteur to cosmic weapon lacks visceral emotional grounding despite surface coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on conceptual leaps (mannequin whispers suddenly enabling stellar destruction) without sufficient mechanical or emotional scaffolding; the compressed arc from discovery to cosmic justice feels arbitrarily compressed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Gorge setting and tower city are visually suggestive but lack distinctive sensory textures; the atmosphere achieves mood through cosmic abstraction rather than embodied physical detail, diminishing immersion despite intriguing premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effectively deploys cosmic irony and imperfection-as-power metaphors, but exposition-heavy delivery weakens emotional resonance; the closing thematic synthesis is conceptually striking though undermined by declarative rather than experiential storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clichés in structural approach to imperfection-as-weaponry, but psychological descriptions feel algorithmically generated (e.g., "angry peace") rather than authentically conflicted; some tropes (stellar vengeance) remain conventionally presented.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Makes bold thematic use of assigned elements, but integration is uneven—gorge setting and mannequin mysticism feel conceptually isolated from Elena's personal journey; the flashlight-as-conduit is the only element with consistently resonant interdependence.</comment>
