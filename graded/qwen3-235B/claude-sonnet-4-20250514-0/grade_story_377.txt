<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; actions align superficially with assigned motivation ("to dig deeper than memory") but remain abstract and passive. Silently expressive trait underutilized beyond gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains logical cause-effect but feels compressed. Concluding emotional resonance lacks earned catharsis; transitions between digital/physical concepts occur without narrative friction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fails to create tangible atmosphere despite promising settings. Sensory details are schematic (e.g., "cotton candy and laughter") rather than immersive. Contrast between Zara's limbo and block parties feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Persuasively explores consciousness-as-weather metaphor and liminality. Emotional impact compromised by exposition-heavy execution of themes; poetic potential undercut by mechanical character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on AI-composite tropes: sentient code, reality-warping artifacts, secret societies. Human nuance absent in Holloway's abrupt awakening. Descriptions like "electronic limbo" exemplify generic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mechanical coherence from assigned elements, but cohesion falters under thematic scrutiny. Worldbuilding lacks integration velocity; emotional/spiritual dimensions of consciousness remain under-conceptualized.</comment>
