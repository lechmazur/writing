<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's consistent motivation is clear, but lacks depth in inner conflict development; her transformation feels somewhat abrupt despite strong ties between her ghostwriting past and quest for agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through tight focus on pivotal event, though compressed arc relies heavily on conveniences (e.g. fabricated provenance); pacing mostly effective despite slight rush in exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush bioluminescent setting masterfully contrasts with political decay above; sensory details (phosphorescent moss, humming energy) create immersive, thematically resonant atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Compelling metaphors (e.g., glowing fruit as truth) and subtextual critique of political hypocrisy; ending feels purposeful but emotional impact could be deeper through shown, not stated, catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong originality in combining poetry/code and botanical decay; avoids overt clichés yet some phrases border on lyrical excess without undercutting overall authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements work cohesively—sandals, journal, and sanctuary meaningfully intertwine with theme—though broader implications of societal complicity remain underexplored despite tight constraints.</comment>
