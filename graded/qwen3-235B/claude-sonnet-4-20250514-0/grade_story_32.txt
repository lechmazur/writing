<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's unique identity as a remembering automaton drives motivations well, but inner conflict lacks sufficient emotional granularity despite strong premise and consistent actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant throughline from coin toss to rebellion, but the pivotal transition from melody to systemic vulnerability feels under-explained for full logical satisfaction within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative decay of Prosperity shines through precise sensory details (sunlight on empty windows, crinkling pamphlet) though the digital simulation mechanics remain underdeveloped beneath atmospheric shell.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (coin melodies as memory, pamphlet's hidden text) create rich subtext. The ending's thematic force lingers, though explicit "mechanical heart" line verges on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with mechanical consciousness theme. Sensory details feel specific rather than formulaic, though coin-melody mechanic occasionally borders on poetic abstraction without sufficient tethering to world logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story feels contained rather than constrained, with elements working synergistically despite minor forced connections. The coin motif and pamphlet revelation create lingering resonance about autonomy vs programming.</comment>
