<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marcus’ creative block is woven into his identity, yet his shift from bitterness to reconciliation feels abrupt, lacking gradual psychological nuance. Motivation to collaborate with Helena hinges on a single metaphor about coral, undermining emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tension between Marcus and Helena drives the plot, but the revelation of Guild files leaks feels unearned. Pacing stumbles in the brief resolution, resolving a three-year conflict through a single phone call.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The steampunk lounge’s sensory details (copper light, clockwork symphony) establish atmosphere, but the setting doesn’t actively shape the characters’ choices or deepen the theme of trust.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors linking coral to trust are poignant, and the violin’s whale-song melody at the end resonates emotionally. The story’s quiet introspection and symbolic marriage of biology/mechanics elevate its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés with the coral metaphor, but Helena’s confession and Marcus’ redemption arc lean on predictable emotional beats. The steampunk elements feel derivative rather than freshly imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong central theme and symbolic cohesion compete with narrative brevity’s constraints. The ending satisfies intellectually but lacks sufficient emotional buildup to feel fully earned.</comment>
