<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's archery background ties to her disillusionment, but motivations shift abruptly without emotional groundwork; the tarnished comb effectively reveals emotional stakes through secondary character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear personal arc from detachment to renewal, but the celestial timeframe and 400-word constraint create rushed transitions; the waterfall's symbolic role maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery in the waterfall and planetary alignment contrasts with sparse worldbuilding; atmosphere leans heavily on metaphors rather than sensory immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphor usage (falling upward, celestial cycles) and emotional resonance in the comb's legacy; undercuts impact with occasional heavy-handed thematic statements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subverts "regret as endpoint" trope but relies on familiar metaphors; the archer's profession and planetary symbolism feel generative rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imaginative premise and satisfying thematic closure outweigh underdeveloped character history; constrained length enhances the focus on transformation.</comment>
