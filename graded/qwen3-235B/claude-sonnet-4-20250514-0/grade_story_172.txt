<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motivations (dread of prophecy, inherited duty) are consistent, but her sudden shift to acceptance feels underexplored. The puzzle box reveals her connection to the past, but emotional nuance in her transformation lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot’s structure moves logically from dread to resolution, driven by the "alignment" action. Some pacing issues in the climax, but coherence and cause-effect logic hold within the constraints. The ending ties the arc together but feels slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The giant seashell’s shifting architecture and moonlit sensuality immerse readers. Sensory details enhance tone, though the "deserted beach" timeframe adds little beyond isolation. Setting and character are tightly linked through mystery and prophecy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evokes tension through paradoxical heroism and subverted expectations. Literary devices (e.g., "sharp gentleness") and the theme of rewriting fate add depth. The ending’s metaphor—prophecy as driftwood—is poignant. Conflict resolution is both satisfying and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but leans slightly on "ancient prophecies" tropes. Similes/metaphors (e.g., "seashell dissolving into sea foam") are original. Emotional nuance is shown, not told (e.g., Maya’s "sharp clarity tempered by gentle acceptance"). Purple prose risks only occasionally undermine impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively; the seashell, prophecy, and puzzle box are interdependent. The tight word count feels intentional, amplifying focus. Subverts expectations (reversed wishes) but occasionally sacrifices emotional payoff for brevity. Leaves a haunting impression of reclaiming agency.</comment>
