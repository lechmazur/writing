<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation but lacks depth; traits like "reserved oracle" and "humbly proud" inform actions but aren't explored with emotional or psychological nuance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear structure well-executed but predictable; pivotal action feels isolated rather than organically evolving; resolution follows formulaic beats without narrative surprises</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually and sonically immersive setting creation through precise details; harmonious interplay between sacred lab, haunting lost sounds, and contrast with mundane choir; some sensory opportunities underdeveloped</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Meticulously crafted metaphors (sound-fabric, embroidery-as-salvation) create rich subtext; elegant prose balances whimsy with existential stakes; ending achieves thematic resonance through poetic reversal of containment</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original integration of sound-weaving as literal/figurative device; avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally verges on ornamental language; emotional states primarily shown through action rather than exposition</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully interwoven rather than arbitrarily assigned; brief format leveraged effectively for focused narrative; thematic coherence achieved but leaves room for deeper exploration</comment>
