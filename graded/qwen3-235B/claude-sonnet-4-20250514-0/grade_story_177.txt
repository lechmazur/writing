<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Magdalena's rebellious nature and role as an obituary writer drive the plot, but her interiority lacks depth. She feels more symbolic than fully realized, with motivations primarily implied through action rather than layered emotional texture or consistent psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story’s arc—climbing the shelf, discovering the mask, animating spirits via the organ—is logically structured but occasionally rushed. The transition to the hidden organ chamber feels abrupt, slightly eroding coherence despite a generally satisfying resolution to her resurrection quest.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie, resonant details like “books groaning like ships” and the leviathan-like organ immerse readers in a decaying, mystical atmosphere. The giant’s library setting is vividly rendered, though the revolution’s role in shaping the environment’s mood remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., the mask’s shifting personas as life choices) and the haunting theme of reclaiming lost potential elevate the story. While the prose occasionally veers into ornateness, the fusion of theatrical necromancy and rebellion against finality creates a powerful, thought-provoking narrative core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story innovatively reworks the “forbidden knowledge” trope through the lens of theatrical resurrection. However, phrases like “dust motes danced like spirits” and the organ’s “rib-like brass pipes” flirt with familiarity, and the revolutionary backdrop risks feeling like a generic dramatic device rather than a visceral force.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Despite minor tonal inconsistencies and a few overstuffed descriptions, the narrative’s fusion of elemental concepts and its haunting, cyclical imagery linger. The tight word limit is managed effectively, though the revolution’s thematic resonance could be more deeply interwoven.</comment>
