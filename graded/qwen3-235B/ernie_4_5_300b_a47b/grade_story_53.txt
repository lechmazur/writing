<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's rashness is underdemonstrated; motivation to find solace hinted but insufficiently grounded; internal shift from protector to self-guardian feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot mechanics functional but predictable; cause-effect between postcard and transformation lacks emotional layering; ending feels compressed rather than fully realized within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly textured with wind/noises, but symbolic connections between setting (caverns, fortress) and character's psyche remain underexploited; sensory details occasionally veer toward generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic imagery (stars, whispers) creates resonance; dialogue serves theme but borders on aphoristic; ending achieves thematic coherence but lacks narrative tension; "showing" often replaced by lyrical "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Mix of vivid metaphors ("mouths gasping with echoes") and clich√©d transitions ("dawn's pale light"); mystical old man trope undercuts originality; emotional arc feels imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>
