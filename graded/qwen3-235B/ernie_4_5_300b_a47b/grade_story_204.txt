<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are generally clear—Lira's cuddler background informs her empathy, but her prejudice against scientists feels underexplored. Dr. Voss's redemption lacks emotional depth despite thematic relevance of decay/transformation. Interactions hint at but don't fully realize psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a compressed arc with satisfying thematic bookends ("decay" as disruption and rebirth). The farmer's market encounter feels tacked-on, undermining cause-effect clarity. Pacing balances exposition and action but strains under the word limit when establishing emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (frayed sweater, whirring punch, storm-gray eyes) create immersion, but the interstellar rail line's significance feels underutilized. Atmosphere emphasizes decay, though the hangar's "silence" and "weed-cracked floor" could further reflect internal emotional states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism—phantom ticket punch as legacy/breakthrough metaphor, decay as ethical ambiguity. The "unspoken rules" concept resonates thematically but occasionally leans on exposition (e.g., "fear of decay made people cling to rules"). Ending ties together ideas with elegant subtext about transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes (cuddler-science dynamic, terraforming ethics) but slips into familiar redemption arcs. Language avoids purple prose but occasionally over-relies on descriptors ("storm-gray," "iridescent"). Subtle tension between nostalgia and progress offers freshness, albeit with predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive yet strained synthesis of elements: the ticket punch and decay concept elevate the narrative, while the farmer's market encounter and "unusually usual" detail feel imposed. Themes are explicit rather than organic, yet the ending's metaphorical resonance justifies structural compromises.</comment>
