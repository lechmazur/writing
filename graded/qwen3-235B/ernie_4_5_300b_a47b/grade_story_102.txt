<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character growth is implied but lacks internal exploration; spinelessness is referenced rather than embodied, and the sudden "standing tall" lacks earned emotional weight despite thematic intentions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically between key moments, but the 500-word constraint strains cause-effect clarity (e.g., decoding the "dollhouse" clue feels undernourished in logic), though the ending achieves symbolic coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive, eerie atmosphere; the map projection room’s luminescent, mutable cartography powerfully materializes the theme of unstable truths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of keys as memory anchors and red threads as fate-shapers adds subtext; however, emotional impact relies too heavily on poetic abstraction rather than earned visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but stumbles into lyrical excess (e.g., “shimmered, their borders shifting like liquid”) and occasionally vague phrasing that obscures character nuance beneath atmospheric prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, with some tension between poetic tone and narrative clarity; the brevity serves the mythic tone but leaves certain character and plot threads underdeveloped.</comment>
