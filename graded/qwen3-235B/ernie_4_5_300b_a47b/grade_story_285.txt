<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s hesitation and awkwardness are physically shown but remain superficial; motivation to ‘restore traditional systems’ is stated rather than meaningfully integrated into his actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through mystical progression rather than narrative logic; the 400-500 word constraint forces underdeveloped transitions (e.g., the hermit’s disappearance, portal creation).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually sumptuous, immersive atmosphere; fused contrasts (geothermal vents/ice, glowing fruit/gray crabs) enhance thematic duality and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, metaphor-rich prose elevates the story; the postcard’s metamorphosis and crabs’ symbolic role create layered meaning; ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting and crabs’ role feel original; hermit and bridge-to-tradition concepts verge on cliché but are conceptually reworked; avoids overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a cohesive, thematically rich whole; the tundra orchard’s logic and the postcard’s transformation are strikingly integrated.</comment>
