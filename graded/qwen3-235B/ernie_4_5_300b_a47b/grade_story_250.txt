<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's blunt heretic identity is superficially stated rather than demonstrated through actions. Motivation tied to the teddy bear feels emotionally shallow, with reactions lacking psychological depth despite the object's symbolic weight. Dialogue reduces complexity to punchy one-liners without revealing inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stock ticker drives plot but its sudden transformation into coordinates lacks internal logic. The temple's collapse as endpoint feels rushed rather than earned. Clear arc exists within constraints, but cause-effect between battles and solutions is mechanically presented rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clichéd sensory shorthand ("dust and forgotten oaths") rather than specific, unsettling details. The juxtaposition of high-tech stock ticker in ancient temple lacks thematic integration, creating tonal dissonance that weakens immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses teddy bear as blunt symbolism rather than subtle metaphor. Ending's "quiet resolve" feels unearned, undercutting thematic weight. The puzzle battle shows potential for cerebral conflict but lacks emotional stakes beyond generic triumph.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on "ancient tech" fantasy trope without subversion. The omniscient mind's riddles, holographic reveal, and crumbling temple climax all follow predictable genre patterns. Language employs overused descriptors like "fever dream" and "whispers" without fresh recontextualization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cohesion exists superficially but strains under scrutiny – temple setting isn't thematically connected to stock ticker, promise-keeping, or wits-as-combat. Story feels like a checklist of elements rather than organic synthesis. Lingering question about "truth's cost" lacks sufficient narrative groundwork.</comment>
