<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a vehicle for theme; psychological depth sacrificed for metaphor, with motivation shifting abruptly from 'duty' to 'connection' without sufficient internal conflict or earned transformation</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Circular structure feels contrived; pivotal anvil scene lacks causal logic, while rapid resolution skips stages of grief or growth necessary to make transcendence credible within the tight scope</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements deployed like puzzle pieces rather than organic components; memorable phrases exist but narrative cohesion and radical originality missing for publication at elite level</comment>
