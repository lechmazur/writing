<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Finn's motivation to survive through invisibility vs. craving transformation feels psychologically inconsistent. His sudden shift to poetic defiance lacks sufficient emotional groundwork. The dummy's role as a catalyst is underexplored—its authority to pronounce Finn "bored" demands more narrative justification. Some voice inconsistencies in dialogue vs. narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within tight constraints, but key transitions (poetry manifesting physical objects, dummy's instructions) rely on unexplained magical logic. The ending resolves the immediate conflict but leaves the dummy's purpose ambiguous. Pacing generally controlled, though the transformation mechanism feels hastily explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere masterfully combines sensory details—steam, foghorn, rust—that mirror Finn's internal turmoil. Corroded industrial decay symbolizes societal stagnation vs. transformation theme. Dummy's unsettling presence enhances the uncanny setting. Atmospheric cohesion elevates tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Irony of a thief finding liberation through creation provokes thought. Poetic metaphors (clockwork key, steam sigils) effectively externalize internal change. Dialogue's stilted moments undercut otherwise strong theme of language as transformative force. Final line's thematic resonance is diluted by vague "sustain" concept.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While imagery avoids overt clichés, the "haunted lighthouse" and "demonic dummy" tread genre boundaries without full subversion. "Scorching poise" lacks concrete embodiment beyond one phrase. Emotional shifts sometimes stated rather than dramatized ("his mind ablaze"), undermining subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements form a functioning whole but don't transcend expected combinations. The dummy's wisdom-to-action structure leans on familiar mentor tropes. Conceptual density (transformation/deconstruction of theft) rewards rereading, but brevity sacrifices narrative complexity that could deepen emotional impact.</comment>
