<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's struggle and transformation are clear but lack gradual nuance in motivation shifts; self-deception theme is present but underdeveloped through psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a decisive arc but relies on abrupt metaphorical transitions; pacing balances dreamlike momentum with word limit constraints without feeling compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clockwork animals and attic setting create a haunting, mechanically vital atmosphere that mirrors character mechanization; chisel's resonance ties physical/spiritual symbolism effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "ghosts of gears judging") and symbolic layering enhance thematic depth; ending satisfies emotionally while leaving room for thematic contemplation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through symbolic cohesion; some ornate phrasing ("unapologetically, gloriously alive") borders on self-indulgence but doesn't undermine originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity despite compact form; pacing choices emphasize emotional beats over strict realism, making brevity feel purposeful.</comment>
