<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated more than demonstrated; the brashness lacks nuance, and the connection between "wild" self-expression and his goal to preserve tradition feels underexplored despite vivid gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The detonation action is compelling but the cause-effect chain from shell patterns to golden dust eruption strains logic; pacing effectively condenses an arc but sacrifices clarity in key transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rich visual details like "tired fluorescent insects" and dancing dust create texture, but the discount store's specific decay doesn't fully reinforce the themes of forgotten traditions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (nautilus growth = cultural rebirth) work conceptually; ending lands with symbolic weight, though explicit "warmth of reciprocity" exposition undermines subtlety. Conflict between preservation and modernity is clear but shallowly developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unique elements like the "dust particle chamber" avoid tropes, but overly ornate phrasing ("primal maps" in nautilus shell) and predictable "cranky traditionalist vs bureaucratic boss" dynamic limit originality's impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong central image (detonating history to seed new growth) unifies most elements, but tonal dissonance between "dusty exuberance" and melancholic relic themes creates friction; some assigned components feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>
