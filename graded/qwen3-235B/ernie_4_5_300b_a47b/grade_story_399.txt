<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arc shows growth but relies too much on internal monologue and underdeveloped backstory; trauma's influence feels superficially applied despite the emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective pacing and arc compression, but the leap to catharsis feels abrupt despite the structural coherence; cause-effect chain for the climax leans on mystical convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, evocative details (e.g., sand mandala, scrying pool) immerse readers in a coherent, haunting atmosphere that enhances psychological and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry, labyrinth) and symbolic resonance of the mandala provoke reflection; ending achieves thematic closure while inviting deeper consideration of trauma’s complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing; imagery is fresh (e.g., "storm of light"), and emotional beats emerge organically through show-don’t-tell without leaning on clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a resonant narrative; brevity amplifies focus on core themes without feeling constrained, though the mythic undertones slightly overshadow realism.</comment>
