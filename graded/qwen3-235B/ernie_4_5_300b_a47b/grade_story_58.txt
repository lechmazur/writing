<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is layered yet occasionally contrived; Jessa's loyalty and struggle for balance are established, but her transformation feels compressed and slightly schematic. Motivation aligns with actions, but interiority lacks sustained depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to constraints with efficiency but flirts with contrivance. The inciting incident (power outage) propels the narrative, while the resolution (journal entry #14) ties back to the theme. Pacing is uneven in moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory atmosphere anchors the story. The moth-as-metaphor motif and "shattered stained glass" imagery are potent. "Sanctified dread" is effectively sustained but occasionally undercut by tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance through subtext and metaphor. The journal entries as symbolic progression, the journal-passing as baton handoff, and the final line achieve poetic economy. Theme of balance-through-chaos is coherent and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s via blending surrealism (philosophical moths) and dark humor. Some phrasing ("storm's heartbeat") veers toward abstraction. Tone shifts are purposeful but occasionally risk thematic diffusion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a fragile yet functional thematic axis. The ending distills the story's tension into a striking image but leaves certain emotional undercurrents underdeveloped.</comment>
