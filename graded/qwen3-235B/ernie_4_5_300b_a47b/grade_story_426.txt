<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but could use more nuanced reactions to assigned attribute/method; "aloof passion" lacks sustained embodiment beyond surface gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from rushed ghost confrontation and underdeveloped connection between marathon training and narrative momentum; cause-effect logic strained by abrupt spectral resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere expertly rendered through concrete sensory details, though bioluminescent herbs and holograms undercut period-appropriate consistency; setting remains deeply immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic integration of legacy vs. modernity through symbols like the mended teapot; emotional beats occasionally telegraphed rather than embodied (e.g. "aloofness melting into resolve").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Genre conventions subverted via tech-herbalism fusion, but some elements (Morse-code playlists) feel contrived; emotional complexity avoids pure formula except in sentimental closing lines.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High concept density creates tension between elements; brevity both strength (economy of detail) and weakness (underexplored temporal framework); thematic unity nearly salvages structural pressures.</comment>
