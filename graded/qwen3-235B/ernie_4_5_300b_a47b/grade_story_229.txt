<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Characters function but lack layered motivations; Elias's obsession feels under-explained, Mara's skepticism lacks internal complexity despite functional dialogue contrast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression and closure but strains logic at key points; storm-as-hymn connection feels conceptually underdeveloped despite satisfying emotional resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Visceral atmosphere through precise textural details like "masts clawing at violet twilight" and humidity-charged pearls; setting acts as third character in the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally fresh combination of ship graveyard with sonic archaeology through rainfall patterns; avoids expected ghost-story tropes with its hymn-of-storms concept.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively but surface-level themes miss deeper exploration; the "compass" metaphoric ending lingers but structural ambition exceeds emotional payoff.</comment>
