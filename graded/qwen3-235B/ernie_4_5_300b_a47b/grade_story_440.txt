<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s paradoxical vow is conceptually rich but lacks emotional depth; actions align with “detached swordsman” yet introspection feels surface-level, relying on abstract declarations rather than lived-in nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing stumbles: the AI conflict feels rushed, diluting tension; the collage’s resolution is elegant but the thematic payoff is compressed, leaving the vow’s transformation underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The futuristic recycling center’s drone-dominated atmosphere is vivid but thinly contextualized; sensory details (crunching glass, bleeding paint) enhance mood but fail to ground the mythic elements in tangible reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (collage = mosaic of loss, pottery = memory) resonate; emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction over felt experience, but the ending’s fusion of art and ritual offers conceptual heft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally substitutes lyricism for depth (e.g., “quiet courage to let go”); the secret weavers and vow subvert detachment tropes but occasionally echo self-help platitudes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit the theme but unevenly: the pottery shard and collage method integrate seamlessly, while the AI drone subplot feels tacked on to force stakes.</comment>
