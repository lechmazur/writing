<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Characters are mostly consistent but lack deeper emotional complexity; Kael's motivation is clear but his internal conflict isn't fully excavated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc but feels compressed; the thematic connection from isolation to redemption is hinted at but underelaborated due to word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting is conceptually rich but thin on sensory immersion; zero-gravity picnics and orbital debris need more textured description to ground the metaphorical weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful use of metaphor and subtext; the interplay between debris and redemption, coathanger-as-symbol, and lyrical closing line elevate the narrative's emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original approach to redemption avoids tropes; metaphors feel fresh, though the poetic tone occasionally edges toward abstraction without sufficient anchoring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Story is cohesive and layered, but the brevity occasionally sacrifices depth in favor of thematic ambition; lingers on ideas rather than narrative resolution.</comment>
