<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characters show surface-level motivations and inconsistent nuance; the spontaneous emotional revelation feels rushed and underpaved by prior narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure holds together but relies on contrived coincidences (karaoke duet) to force resolution; pacing stumbles under word count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting contains vivid phrases but lacks cohesive worldbuilding logic; hourglass concept as a mere aesthetic layer rather than functional metaphor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moments of freshness (hourglass marketplace) undermined by formulaic emotional beats and strained lyricism; avoids clich√© but not predictable sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambient poeticism distracts from deeper thematic excavation; story remains self-contained rather than challenging reader expectations or leaving resonance.</comment>
