<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Guide's motivations feel abstract; companion's silent presence lacks emotional depth or evolution despite key revelation; dialogue serves thematic aims but lacks genuine human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Train journey creates structural momentum but narrative relies on esoteric thematic beats rather than organic plot progression; abrupt transitions between scenes undercut coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Blackout atmosphere rendered with sensory precision; mist-shrouded liminality and tactile details (embroidery threads, ozone scent) create immersive unease and wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors create rich subtext about silence as agency; the plains' scream-as-yearning conceit resonates thematically; emotional undercurrents could be more viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative but occasionally overwrought phrasing ("agony that breaks you open"); avoids clich√©s through precise imagery yet borders on stylistic self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Echoing theme of finding light in darkness emerges powerfully, but formal constraints and underdeveloped character dynamics limit broader resonance.</comment>
