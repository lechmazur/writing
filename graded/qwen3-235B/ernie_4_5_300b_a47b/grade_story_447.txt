<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are partially clear (mending community) but inner drives feel underdeveloped; the "dutifully defiant" trait manifested through actions but lacked emotional nuance; connection between the toy ear and her personal history remains underexplored</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure compressed into tight word limit; the bulletin's deterioration effectively creates urgency; resolution slightly rushed (mayor's key handoff feels under-motivated); tight cause-effect chain but emotional beats thin</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Abandoned factory and amber prison establish cohesive melancholic atmosphere; vivid sensory details in soup-making and banner-stitching; prison's role feels underdeveloped conceptually; prison-library connection lacks symbolic resonance</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (soup as narrative conduit, toy ear as communal heart) elevate impact; ending's thematic clarity ("scars mended by labor") effective but pat; tension between defiance and preservation underexplored; showing vs. telling balanced but occasionally uneven</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique time-travel mechanism; some risk of melodrama with "heart-shaped toy ear" that's skillfully subverted; language precise but occasionally overwrought ("fractured community" phrasing); character psychology feels human despite fantastical elements</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Precisely executed metaphoric framework binds elements together; assigned components function purposefully (bulletins=plot engine, toy ear=anchor) but amber prison feels more like backdrop than active setting; compact structure succeeds thematically but sacrifices deeper character interiority</comment>
