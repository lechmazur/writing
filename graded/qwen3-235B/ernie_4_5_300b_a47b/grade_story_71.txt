<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; apathy as a trait remains stagnant rather than shaping a dynamic arc. Motivation via forgotten oath feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has momentum but feels truncated; VR transition disrupts pacing. Virtual realm’s connection to central conflict is underexplained, weakening cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with fossilized giant and glowing lines creates eerie atmosphere. Sensory details (whispering fan, crackling static) immerse effectively despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic exploration of duty vs. freedom is thought-provoking. Ending lacks visceral impact; subtext present but not fully realized through character or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of concepts (scarecrow, VR, multiverse) avoids clichés. Prose is lyrical but occasionally cryptic; tension between economy and complexity is well-balanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story lingers conceptually but lacks emotional stakes. Elements fit thematically, yet the brevity masks underdeveloped threads, diluting lasting resonance.</comment>
