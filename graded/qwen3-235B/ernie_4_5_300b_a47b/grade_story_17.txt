<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivations are clear but lack nuanced emotional depth. The chipped bowl effectively reveals her moral conflict, yet her internal transformation feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent within tight constraints, but pacing stumbles during Mara's backstory delivery. Cause/effect connections hold, though the thematic pivot from guilt to renewal lacks gradual tension resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Viscerally rendered atmosphere (iron filings, frost-crunching boots) masterfully amplifies the theme of fractured legacies. Minor over-reliance on gothic clich√©s (cobwebbed rafters) slightly dilutes originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of subtext in eulogies as narrative lens. Metaphors (bowl=mirror/labyrinth) create layered meaning. The "cracked compass" resolution synthesizes theme and imagery with memorable emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Few AI-signature pitfalls: some decorative phrasing ("fractured light") borders on ornate, but metaphors remain fresh. Emotional nuance (Mara's compromised ethics) avoids simplistic moralizing. Subtext dominates over exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly integrate. The witch's chamber and eulogy analysis feel like separate ideas spliced together rather than organically connected. Themes of inherited guilt and renewal remain potent despite structural inconsistencies.</comment>
