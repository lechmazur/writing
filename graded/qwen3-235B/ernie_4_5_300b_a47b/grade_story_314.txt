<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but thinly rendered; Jora's transformation feels abrupt rather than earned, though her voice carries distinctiveness in moments of doubt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot drives forward via surreal events but strained coherence; pivotal action (kelp transformation) lacks grounding logic, and the tight arc is undermined by rushed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting is visually sparse despite "kelp forest" potential; atmosphere leans on salt/sound descriptors but fails to fully integrate sensory or thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Promising symbolism (bread box as facade) and theme of institutional rot emerge, but emotional resonance diluted by overreliance on abstract gestures over concrete character/subtext work.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality in kelp/spirit imagery is undercut by tropes (dystopian disillusionment, tribal dance); emotional beats verge on melodrama, with uneven stylistic control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion falters under assigned elements' weight; ambitious thematic ambitions outpace execution, leaving conceptual fragments rather than resonant synthesis.</comment>
