<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Marlowe’s unique role as a glamorous undertaker is vividly established, but her interiority and emotional stakes could deepen further to fully align motivation with action; the myth of ordinariness shapes her vocation but lacks visceral, personal consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elaborate ritual-driven plot unfolds cohesively within constraints, but the arc ends with abstract closure rather than emotional payoff; elongating the coffin feels symbolic rather than dramatically urgent, slightly undercutting narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cyber-morgue juxtaposition is striking (servers/humans, paint/digital archives), but sensory details uneven—auditory hums and tactile paint textures excel, while timelessness risks vagueness; the setting’s implications aren’t fully interrogated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (coffins as containers for unmet yearning, paint as portal, gold-streaked blue as shattered myth) resonate powerfully; the theme of preservation vs. erasure lingers, though emotional impact is sometimes filtered through abstraction rather than raw human immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elevates tropes (gothic undertaker, familial secrets) with specificity; avoids predictable pathos by linking data to mortality; language occasionally veers toward baroque, but the concept’s originality and subversive mourning rituals feel strikingly human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into a thematically unified whole; the mortician-digital hybrid setting could risk gimmickry but is grounded in emotional logic; concise but never feels abbreviated, with lingering resonance in its critique of curated lives.</comment>
