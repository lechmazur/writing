<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Marla’s obsessive, grief-driven behavior feels organic, but sardonic glee is repeated too mechanically; her transformation is compelling but lacks quieter emotional moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Narrative moves efficiently from pattern recognition to conspiracy but relies on abrupt revelations; the Fibonacci spiral’s logic feels compressed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Facility’s sterile chaos contrasts with Marla’s naturalist mindset vividly; sensory details (neon buzz, storm cloud disappearance) immerse readers, though the orchard past isn’t deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors connect grief to pattern-seeking; the peacock becomes a layered symbol. Ending lands theme of layered truth but dialogue remains functional, not lyrical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic conspiracies by grounding them in organic patterns. Some phrases (e.g., “storm cloud”) feel slightly generic; emotional subtext lingers but isn’t fully unpacked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively; the short length feels intentional. Resolution leans on FBI convenience, slightly undercutting the story’s intellectual momentum.</comment>
