<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; Lira's sudden alignment with Kael's plan lacks internal conflict despite high stakes; her professional expertise as a dream interpreter isn't fully demonstrated beyond convenient plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ambitious plot compressed into tight word limit - structural integrity maintained but emotional beats feel truncated; pivotal identity deception resolved too swiftly, undermining dramatic potential; cause-effect chain between vapor manipulation and legal reform remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich yet unevenly rendered - corrosion-resistant industrial imagery contrasts effectively with ethereal vapor politics, but tactile details inconsistent; sensory overload from "humming conduits" and "metallic tang" doesn't fully translate societal oppression into visceral experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes occasionally overpower substance; the metaphor of "calcified laws" shows promise but execution prioritizes concept over emotional resonance; philosophical undercurrents (truth's malleability) hinted but not deeply examined; ending's thematic closure feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding edges toward cyberpunk-gothic hybrid but recycles tropes about institutional rot; impersonation device feels underexplored dramatically; occasional phrases ("quiet pulse of subconscious desires") lean toward poetic abstraction rather than original metaphor construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive at surface level through strong central conceit, but thematic unity compromised by uneven integration of elements; vapor metaphor works better than underutilized "peculiar faith"; shortness exposed rather than elevated through strategic compression; lingering question about cost of rewriting truth remains unexamined.</comment>
