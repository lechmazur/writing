<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation ties to personal grief and redemption, but internal conflict is articulated through cliché memories rather than nuanced psychological complexity; reactions to the hairbrush and honesty concept feel forced rather than organically revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges on the plausible use of the hairbrush-as-antenna method, with a clear arc from grief to revelation; pacing stumbles slightly with the sudden brush slip, but the structure remains coherent within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radio wave garden’s eerie sensory details (static, rust) and water tower’s amplification create a vivid, haunting atmosphere that deepens the central mystery; tone aligns with the story’s introspective melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (e.g., “static as ghosts,” railways as confessions) and subtext about truth-telling elevate the narrative; some emotional beats lean on stated feelings (“despairing cheer”) rather than layered showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unique elements (radio wave garden, unconventional mapping method) avoid tropes, but mother’s ghostly voice and “erased towns” reveal border on cliché; language is vivid without veering into purple prose, though some transitions feel slightly mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements work interdependently (hairbrush ties to memory, railways to government secrecy), yet the radio wave garden and hairbrush’s physicality feel more instrumental than thematically essential; ending resonates but leaves subtext unevaluated.</comment>
