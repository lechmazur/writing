<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character development is poetic but lacks psychological depth; Kael's transformation through static and filament shows growth but relies more on metaphor than lived-in motivation. The "mentor's lessons" feel underexploited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plotted like a parable with beginning/end symmetry, but the interplay of action (reverse-engineering) strains coherence. The cordless phone feels inserted rather than organic to the setting. Pacing prioritizes lyricism over narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory details (pulsing fruit, bioluminescent vines, groaning hull) create a hauntingly unique atmosphere. The "waxed constellations" and "void’s hum" marry theme to setting. Some elements (phone in space) disrupt logic but succeed aesthetically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("cracks as constellations") resonate. The ending achieves thematic closure but risks sentimentality. Subtext about constructed identity works, but the "cordless phone" device borders on abstract gimmickry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through innovative combinations (sci-fi + pastoral), though "reverse-engineer wisdom" concept feels oddly mechanical. Language occasionally overcompensates with adjectives but maintains emotional authenticity through fragmented confessions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of fractured belonging unifies disparate elements. The orchard ship's decay/churn mirrors Kael's growth. Occasionally prioritizes style over clarity but maintains conceptual cohesion through recurring symbols like light/wounds.</comment>
