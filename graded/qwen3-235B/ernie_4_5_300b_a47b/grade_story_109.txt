<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Alaric's "cold nature" is underdeveloped, though his shift from rebellion to empathetic listener is implied through his interaction with the mitten. Motivation for folk remedies is clear but could deepen his internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient for a short form, but the leap from arranging objects to a vision feels under-contextualized. The resolution is thematically tied but slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like frost, wool texture, and chamomile scent create atmosphere, but the "secret agent center" clashes with the otherwise medieval aesthetic, muddling authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant use of symbolism (altars as incomplete stories) and resonance of tradition vs. authority. The melody as a remedy subverts expectations, but emotional impact leans slightly on tell-not-show.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrases ("quiet pulse of rebellion") are overwrought, and the premise risks romanticizing anti-authority tropes. However, the fusion of rebellion and tradition shows ingenuity beyond formulaic arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story sacrifices some coherence for thematic ambition. Integration of assigned elements is uneven, but the closing metaphor of "curator of rebellion" lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
