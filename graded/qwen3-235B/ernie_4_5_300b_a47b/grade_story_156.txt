<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character development is present but surface-level; Ambrose's internal conflict is glimpsed but underexplored despite strong imagery and situational context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing is taut and cohesive, with the bus journey structuring the narrative arc effectively, though the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion through bioluminescent moss, salt-streaked glass, and bird formations creates a haunting, memorable atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (birds as algorithms, rituals as evolution) provoke intellectual engagement, though emotional impact is undercut by abstract introspection over visceral character shifts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original in concept (birds as policy metaphor), but some phrasing ("primal one," "counterpoint of hearts") borders on overwritten obscurity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements like the spare key and birds are tightly integrated, but the core concept of "counterpoint of hearts" remains underwrought in driving the narrative.</comment>
