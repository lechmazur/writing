<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's dry wit emerges through dialogue but motivation wavers; vengeful drive against Elias lacks emotional depth, while dance practice feels underexplored as a metaphor for personal healing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot's thematic arc (tradition to transformation) resolves effectively within constraints, but the middle section—conflating Elias' betrayal with the dance—is narratively compressed, sacrificing emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse evokes rich, spectral atmosphere with briny textures and mechanical groans, though some descriptors ("sharp and desperate" music, "unbroken" beam) lean on familiar imagery rather than revelatory specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (frayed rope/tradition, dance/repair) resonate powerfully; ending subverts nostalgia with thematic rigor. Subtext about living traditions over preserved relics is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Few overwrought lines ("let it burn"), but avoids purple prose overall. Emotional complexity emerges through gesture (bloodied thumb, rope tension) rather than exposition, with the ending's philosophical pivot feeling earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere around erosion and renewal, though Elias' betrayal and the daughter's absence suggest underdeveloped threads. Lingering impact stems from sensory immersion and existential clarity.</comment>
