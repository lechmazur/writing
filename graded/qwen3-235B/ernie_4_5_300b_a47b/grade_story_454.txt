<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited exploration of the "reckless" aspect; motivation is clear but inconsistently integrated into decision-making. Emotional core relies on stated objects rather than nuanced behavior showing rational/emotional duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Concise execution but abrupt transitions between key plot points (map tearing, Mara's sudden appearance). Cause-effect logic holds, but emotional arc feels truncated within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details create strong atmosphere ("decay and cotton candy"), but setting rarely interacts actively with character psychology or narrative progression beyond static backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Surface-level dramatic tension with underdeveloped emotional resonance. Relies on stylized imagery ("skeletal grin") without sufficient subtext or thematic payoff to elevate craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Formulaic elements (haunted houses, secret groups) remain unchallenged. Dialogue feels rehearsed, tone shifts between "jubilant despair" rely on labels rather than organic character/plot dynamics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements present but insufficiently synthesized. Plot momentum depends on genre conventions rather than creative synthesis; emotional weight remains implied rather than demonstrated.</comment>
