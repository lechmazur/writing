<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (rebellious defiance against predestination) but lacks psychological depth beyond archetypal rebellion; her role as an obituary-writer for the living is conceptually rich but underexplored in shaping specific decisions or interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot is visually vivid but structurally uneven; the organ's causal role in manifestation is underexplained, and the abrupt shift from mask discovery to revolutionary climax feels perfunctory despite strong thematic ties; pacing prioritizes lyricism over narrative causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting works as surreal philosophy—a giant’s bookshelf as codex of fate is haunting. Sensory details (shifting mask, trembling organ pipes) create immersive tension, though revolution rumors underutilize historical/political texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Stylistically daring: metaphors transcend decoration (labyrinth of choices, sound birthing consequence) and the ending's thematic payoff ("beginnings, not endings") resonates intellectually while subverting expectation of literal action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><comment><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (theater mask as metaphysical device) but occasionally relies on familiar rebellion tropes; poetic language occasionally slides into ornate abstraction ("lucid frenzy," "labyrinth of choices") that risks obscuring emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive in its ambition to merge metaphysical speculation with mythic storytelling; the ending feels earned thematically if narratively condensed.</comment>
