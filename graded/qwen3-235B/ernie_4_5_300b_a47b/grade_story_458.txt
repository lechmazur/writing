<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve tradition is clear but underdeveloped; Jaxon's opposition lacks nuanced rationale, veering into one-dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but feels rushed—the confrontation with Jaxon resolves too cleanly, and the bridge’s emergence lacks buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive but unevenly grounded; the abandoned spaceport’s decay enhances mood, but the spiritually secular context remains underexplored and abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (bridge, stains) and thematic tension between preservation/obliteration resonate, though the ending’s moralizing slightly undermines subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi with mystical elements is undercut by familiar conflict tropes and occasional overwrought descriptions (“grinding gears” simile).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain in execution—the button and coffee stains feel contrived, while the bridge’s magic remains under-explained.</comment>
