<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character is whimsically written but lacks psychological depth; motives (self-expression via "naturalizing" hauntings) feel abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Personality traits shape actions superficially but don't evolve or reveal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear sequence but feels compressed; transitions between discoveries (melody fragments, vials, piano) lack causal weight. Resolution feels abrupt despite effective narrative framing; mosaic realities hinted at but not structurally integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere through synesthetic details (smells of ozone, pulsing brick texture). Tension between decay and surreal beauty anchors the haunted setting. Underutilizes spatial logic of cellar to deepen mystery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery and clever metaphors (cracked lens as metaphor for fragmented perception) elevate craft. Emotional impact is fleetingâ€”themes of self-expression remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt through character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Combines familiar elements (haunted house, musical ghosts) with inventive flourishes but risks oversaturating tone. "Mosaic realities" concept feels derivative of Borges-esque tropes. Language occasionally leans on poetic abstraction to mask narrative vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Successfully unifies required elements but struggles to balance whimsy with thematic heft. The brief format exposes underdeveloped ideas (e.g., "mosaic realities"), though the haunting-through-creation premise offers intriguing potential for deeper exploration.</comment>
