<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haru's motivation to escape a cycle of violence is clear, but his traumatic past as a lawman remains underdeveloped; his actions (planting seeds, breaking the mural) align with his quest for atonement, but emotional depth feels occasionally generalized rather than viscerally personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plots pivots on the misplaced letter and spectral revelation, which strain plausibility; pacing is urgent but the confrontation with Yumi and the mural's destruction feel abrupt, though the thematic loop from violence to renewal is coherent within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere with vivid details (lichened stones, skeletal garden shoots) evokes decay and rebirth; however, some descriptions (e.g., "corroded rapture") lean on abstraction rather than grounded sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (shattered spectacles/mural, seedling through rubble) deepens the theme; dialogue is sparse but resonant ("gathering broken pieces"); the ending balances hope and cyclical tension effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in favor of metaphoric ambiguity; the spectacles’ fractured vision and spectral letter border on the supernatural but maintain eerie originality; occasional phrases ("rictus of fear") verge on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified tone of haunted renewal; some components (e.g., the castle’s supernatural flexibility) stretch logic, but the lyrical prose and existential themes justify the brevity as a deliberate canvas for contemplation.</comment>
