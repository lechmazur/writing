<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lila’s wreck-diver background and ghost-whispering ability are underexplored, weakening motivation. Her actions (shooting, thawing) align with her traits but lack layered psychological nuance. The letter framing implies unresolved grief but doesn’t fully integrate with her professional skills as a diver.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The amber’s discovery triggers the plot efficiently, but the transition from memory to action (firing the rifle) feels abrupt. The letter framing ties beginning/end neatly but leaves the central conflict (rebellion vs. remembrance) underdeveloped. Pacing works but lacks precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative decay in descriptions (“creaked like a rusted hymn”) creates atmosphere, but the carnival’s physicality doesn’t deepen Lila’s emotional arc. The setting’s ghostly potential clashes with its role as a static memory trigger. Sensory details are vivid but inconsistently utilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (fireworks as rebellion, beetle as frozen grief) elevate the themes. Emotional resonance is undercut by telling (“joyfully melancholic”); ending blends hope/mourning effectively. The subtext of tradition as a bridge over shadow is clear but could be more complex.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing (“drowned summers long drowned”) skirts cliché, but the fusion of carnival decay with supernatural amber avoids predictability. Motivations are humanized, though the “thawing heart” conceit leans familiar. The tone remains consistent despite these minor stumbles.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>While cohesive and thematically resonant, depth feels limited by the constraint—Lila’s backstory and relationship with the carnival deserve expansion. The brevity serves the “bridge” metaphor effectively, but the ending’s optimism lacks earned gravitas.</comment>
