<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s herbalist background is underutilized; her transition from indifference to acceptance is abrupt, lacking visceral engagement with her inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-driven arc is cohesive, but the brevity flattens the resolution’s emotional weight, leaving the transformation feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting and tone harmonize with themes of isolation and epiphany; the observatory’s decay and salt-saturated details evoke a haunting, lived-in melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., bellows as control, ink as chaos) and the subtextual clash between order and surrender resonate deeply, culminating in a resonant, symbolic conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (moonwort extract, “sapped herbalist”) and thematic nuance avoid cliché; some descriptors (e.g., “fervent indifference”) verge on overcooked abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements fuse tightly into a thematic whole; while the concise arc sacrifices some emotional texture, the metaphorical clarity and haunting final image linger powerfully.</comment>
