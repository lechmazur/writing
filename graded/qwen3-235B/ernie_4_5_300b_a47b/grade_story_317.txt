<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s nostalgic and anxiously fearless traits are articulated but underexplored; actions align with role as a caretaker but lack layered motivation or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc (problem, action, resolution) but hinges on abrupt revelations (crystals "biological revenge") that strain coherence; pacing mostly manages tight constraints but feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (warm brass, fizzing crystals) but the levitation facility’s unique qualities feel underutilized in service of theme or tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story uses metaphors (betrayal as growth, "fizz" as crisis) effectively; ending implies cyclical resolve but lacks deeper emotional resonance beyond stated resolve.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in conceptualizing betrayal’s physical manifestation; avoids clichés (android’s nuanced reflection, "brazen modesty") but relies on familiar tropes (lonely AI caretaker, crystalline threats).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive but unevenly weighted—strengths lie in imagery and theme, but not all assigned elements feel essential (e.g., levitation facility’s role is ornamental).</comment>
