<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits inform actions but lack emotional depth; motivations are clear but underexplored beyond plot utility. Reacts logically to objects but shows little psychological nuance or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses through key-driven action but relies on compressed exposition; connections between clues and resolution feel schematic. Pacing works within constraints but lacks organic tension development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Damp, rusted, and ghostly elements create strong physical and emotional atmosphere. Sensory details like iron-tasting air and shimmering walls immerse readers, though some descriptors lean close to genre tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor ("heartbeat-synced hum") and symbolic resonance (water as healing after water war). Ending feels earned but lacks thematic subversion; emotional impact partially earned through implication rather than immersion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (phone company keys to star maps) but relies on archetypal haunted lighthouse/water shortages. Notes feel like narrative scaffolding rather than organic clues. Avoids purple prose but occasionally employs overly schematic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere for plot mechanics but strain thematic unity. Short length serves mystery pacing well but limits emotional payoff. Combines unusual elements (drowned cities) with familiar tropes (vanishing mentors) in mostly balanced proportions.</comment>
