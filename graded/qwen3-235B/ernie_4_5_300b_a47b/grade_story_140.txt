<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clara's tortured protector nature is stated rather than deeply explored. Her motivation to embrace denied fate is clear but lacks nuanced emotional layers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc despite word constraints. The planetarium encounter serves as a functional catalyst but could be more organically integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Abandoned dressing room evokes haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (cracked mirrors, dust) powerfully reinforce themes of decay and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (doll's fractures, mirror shattering) reinforce themes. The ending balances completion and openness. Emotional impact is slightly diminished by predictable arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes mostly enhance rather than distract. Some imagery (nebula-like dust) borders on clich√©. Character psychology remains surface-level despite lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but not memorably. The story achieves its conceptual goals well but lacks distinctive voice that would make it exceptional among literary peers.</comment>
