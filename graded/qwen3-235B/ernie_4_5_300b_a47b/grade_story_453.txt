<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity overshadows depth; motivation is clear but underexplored beyond obsessive behavior, with actions aligning superficially rather than psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative follows a definable arc but feels compressed; progression from winter to spring is effective but strained by word limit's constraints on causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative miniature world-building through tactile details (fogged glass, warped plastic) and ethereal atmosphere; setting is both literal and symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphor usage and thematic cohesion (delusion as creation); earns emotional impact through implication rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre traps; sidesteps "mad genius" clich√©s by framing obsession as collaborative with the world itself rather than a simple struggle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements are interdependent (cup lid as conceptual linchpin, snow globe as narrative container); brevity enhances the mythic tone.</comment>
