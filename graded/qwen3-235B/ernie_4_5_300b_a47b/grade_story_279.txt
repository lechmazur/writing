<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s motivation and traits cohere, but emotional depth and stakes could be more viscerally felt or explicitly embedded in action. The use of the paperclip as a tool is clever but does not fully crystallize her “tactical recklessness” beyond one transaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean cause-effect chain through film comparison driving revelation; pacing is generally tight but leans heavily on compressed exposition in final revelation, slightly undercutting impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory textures and scale of the giant’s library, with light, dust, and decaying parchment creating a tactile, haunted atmosphere that enhances thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic layering (film as historical record, gradience as erasure), precise imagery, and evocative ending that reframes survival as acts of defiance; almost no passive phrasing or flatness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre shortcuts; the “giants’ silence” as a metaphor for climate denial is sharp but occasionally slips into familiar dystopic rhythms without fully destabilizing them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven, especially the paperclip and footage method; tone and theme align, though some exposition risks feeling like narrative shorthand rather than organic discovery.</comment>
