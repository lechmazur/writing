<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While Elias' dismay and rationality are explicit, his internal life remains abstract; his minstrel identity shapes his quest but lacks depth, rendering his emotional journey more symbolic than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arcs from obsession to revelation coherently within constraints, but the pivotal moment of mosaic alignment feels abrupt; the action's drive is clear, though pacing compresses resolution too hastily.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating sky-lounge and garden secrets immerse readers in a tactile, haunting atmosphere; sensory details (singing fountains, sentient vines) amplify tension between reality and illusion, enhancing both plot and theme.</comment>
