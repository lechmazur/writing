<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Promises of emotional depth undercut by generic "dying star" metaphor; character voice occasionally transcends clichés but motivation sometimes feels imposed rather than naturally emergent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Effective midpoint clarity but rushed progression from confrontation to resolution; the pivotal clash feels abbreviated, relying on visual spectacle over narrative logic; thematic ending lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Evocative phrases like "cold gaze of Earth’s moon" create atmosphere but setting remains superficial backdrop; failed opportunity connecting lunar harshness to Kael's "lukewarm" nature or the concept of echoes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong closing metaphor about echoes lingering, but excessive reliance on abstract phrases like "weight of unspoken truths"; subtext about trauma vs. hope feels promising yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repetitive "flicker/fade" imagery and melodramatic "trembling with truths" writing; emotional resonance weakened by overt thematic overstatement rather than nuanced character reactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition is present, but execution reveals awkward seams between assigned elements; the "hush" framing device feels artificially imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>
