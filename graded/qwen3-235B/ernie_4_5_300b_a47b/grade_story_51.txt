<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and symbolically tied to the crate slat, but emotional complexity feels slightly underexplored; dialogue occasionally veers toward the didactic, slightly diluting the protagonist's nuance as a reformed thug.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is minimally coherent, with a beginning and end linked by Marcus' resolve, but the pacing is uneven—exposition about past museum encounters disrupts flow, and the timeframe phrasing ("in the second a silhouette appears") feels awkward and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The static electricity garden creates a distinctive atmosphere that mirrors Marcus' inner turmoil, but sensory details are sparse, and the setting’s potential to deepen the theme of resilience is only partially realized; its crackling energy remains more metaphorical than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story leans on effective symbolism (the crate slat’s shifting meaning, the garden’s charged air) and ends on a resonant image, but dialogue occasionally resorts to stated epiphanies rather than subtext, slightly weakening emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality is present in the garden’s haunting imagery and the crate slat’s symbolism, but some phrasing (“fractured psyche,” “language for his silence”) risks cliché; character psychology feels slightly schematic, leaning on redemptive tropes without full subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story coherently incorporates most elements, but the museum-meeting method and “rationally subjective” attribute feel underexplained; the tight word limit exposes structural thinness, with themes conveyed more through abstraction than lived-in detail.</comment>
