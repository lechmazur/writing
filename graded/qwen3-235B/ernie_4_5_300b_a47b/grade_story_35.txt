<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is hinted but never fully dramatized; motivation feels imposed rather than organically revealed through action; nuanced emotional beats flattened by overly poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes suggest thematic cohesion but lack narrative momentum; emotional climax (reading the note) feels engineered rather than earned within the constrained structure; unresolved tension between observation and revelation weakens arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere of sterile translation center contrasting with tactile, emotional undercurrents is masterfully rendered through sensory dichotomies (glass corridors vs. cool soil, synthesized calls vs. hummed melodies); over-reliance on "glass" metaphors slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic compression creates haunting emotional resonance; flicker imagery and pursed secrets function as effective symbols; ending's metaphorical translation of bird calls borders on cliche but earns emotional heft through meticulous build-up.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some AI-like patterns: repetitive use of "quiet" and "translation"; emotional shifts occasionally stated rather than embodied; surreal elements (neural-color device) introduced without grounding; avoids most purple prose but occasionally substitutes ambiguity for depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres but prioritizes mood over substance; assigned elements serve thematic framework yet some (translation center) remain conceptually underexplored; ending achieves poetic closure but limited emotional payoff despite lyrical precision.</comment>
