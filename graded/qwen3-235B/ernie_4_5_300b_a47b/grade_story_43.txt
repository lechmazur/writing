<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid but motivation to find courage remains underexplored - her introversion and skepticism about courage are established but don't sufficiently drive her physical journey through the cathedral. Internal conflict feels vaguely defined despite strong atmospheric context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints, but hologram revelation feels rushed. The meandering plot mirrors the theme but pacing stumbles during CD's projection. Ending's symbolic progression works within word limit but requires narrative shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Neon cathedral's bioluminescent decay masterfully merges cyberpunk and elegiac tones. Sensory fusion of cold altar stone with pulsing light creates unsettling contrast. Fog and fireflies form haunting navigational metaphor. Timeframe context remains visually stated rather than emotionally woven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates poetic control with phrases like "neon veins" and "crooked rhythm of hope". Theme of courage as journey rather than destination resonates. Subtext about memory-as-music adds dimensionality. Some emotional beats (hologram message) verge on sentimental exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking original imagery (neon cathedral's "synthetic hues mimicking life") contrasts with clich√©d phrases ("dancing with fear"). Writing avoids purple prose through fragmented syntax mirroring the damaged CD. Occasionally over-reliant on atmospheric descriptors at expense of emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly purposeful, though post-apocalyptic timeframe feels decorative rather than essential. The CD as narrative device is inventive, fireflies as cartographic metaphor compelling. Ending's aurora revelation achieves thematic resonance while maintaining mystery. Technical execution nearly reaches publishable standard but lacks final polishing.</comment>
