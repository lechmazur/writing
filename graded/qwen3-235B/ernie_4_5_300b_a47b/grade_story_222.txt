<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's "philically shallow" trait informs some dialogue but not emotional depth; motivation to harness power has surface-level connection to void within.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear beginning/end around dance timeline, but pivotal action (taming) feels rushed; cause-effect between brooch holograms and ambassador's reaction requires more narrative weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Extraterrestrial setting avoids generic tropes; some similes ("pulse like a sleeping giant") occasionally edge toward familiar imagery; no significant formulaic structure detected.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements serve plot structure competently but without innovation; symbolic threads suggest thematic heft that narrative execution doesn't fully realize.</comment>
