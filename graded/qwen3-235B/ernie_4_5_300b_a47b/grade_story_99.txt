<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's telekinesis and bookbinding tie to themes but lack deeper integration; motivations are clear but emotional grounding in her "restless hunger" could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flashbacks drive the revival effectively, but transitions feel abrupt; the carnival booth's role in the plot remains underexplored despite its visual richness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in the booth's decay, but the carnival setting's link to "lost legends" feels underdeveloped and metaphorically diffuse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (wrapper as memory, transformation as letting go) resonate; the ending's thematic payoff is elegant but leans slightly on overt exposition rather than earned subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; chopstick wrapper and trinket transformations feel fresh. Some lines ("tapestry of lost legends") veer toward abstraction without earning their weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>High cohesion but unevenly realized: the booth and wrapper are masterfully utilized, while "lost legends" and "grandiose subtlety" lack narrative urgency to fully integrate.</comment>
