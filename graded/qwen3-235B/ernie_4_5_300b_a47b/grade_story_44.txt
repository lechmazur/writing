<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength in showing Jessa's intellectual curiosity and shift from skepticism to purpose, but her emotional depth remains underdeveloped despite clear motivation to preserve traditions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive arc with tight cause-effect (tickets → lamp → transformation), but some pacing hiccups in middle exposition dilute tension. Ending feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between carnival decay and cosmic salvage hint at deeper themes, but sensory details uneven—smell/sight dominate, while tactile/auditory layers lack consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (lamp as intersection of science/mysticism) and metaphor-laden prose elevate the narrative into a meditation on legacy. Ending lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of carnival esoterica and space debris avoids pure trope-mongering. Character voice feels lived-in, though "burnt sugar" ties to grandmother feel slightly forced-as-subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements like the lamp’s mechanics strain plausibility but work symbolically. Some structural compression issues (car rides underutilized), overall strong thematic integration.</comment>
