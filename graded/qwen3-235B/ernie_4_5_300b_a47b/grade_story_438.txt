<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is visually vivid but motivation lacks emotional depth; actions feel plot-driven rather than psychologically inevitable. The family legacy trauma is hinted but never viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot mechanics work but pacing feels compressed; emotional beats about rewriting history arrive abruptly. The destruction climax lacks earned weight within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details and atmospheric tech-mystic contrasts immerse readers. The lab’s sterile decay and attic’s nostalgia clash create haunting dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stylistic elegance and symbolic imagery (e.g., breadcrumbs/Polaroids) elevate it, but ending’s thematic weight feels under-nourished. Dialogue remains flat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Original concepts (gene-splicing mystics) undercut by predictable "forbidden vault" tropes. The AI voice LUX lacks personality beyond plot device.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade>  
<comment>Elements coexist but don’t fully synergize; the mystic/scientist duality remains underexplored thematically despite clever imagery. Leaves intriguing but unfulfilled ideas.</comment>
