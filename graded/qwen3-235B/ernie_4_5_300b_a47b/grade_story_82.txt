<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly explored; the shift from reluctant caretaker to resolver feels underdeveloped, though the dragon tooth's role in shaping actions is well-integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent with inventive connections to the central concept, but pacing issues and underexplored conflicts (e.g., minimal tension during the finale) prevent full cohesion within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly rendered with vivid, specific details (neon vines, sentient fungi) that deepen mood and theme, though a few elements (e.g., holograms) could better align with Neo-Eden’s established logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (e.g., Withering-as-rebirth) and resonant ending elevate the narrative; emotional beats are sometimes stated rather than shown but are bolstered by sharp, evocative language and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some fresh twists (terraforming dragons) coexist with predictable beats (chosen-one arc); prose is largely tight but occasionally leans on familiar tropes (cursed relics, holographic exposition) without full subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>The story succeeds as a compact, self-contained piece with thematic unity, though its brevity occasionally sacrifices deeper exploration of ideas, leaving some elements (e.g., Neo-Eden’s history) underdeveloped.</comment>
