<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s creativity and regret are thematically consistent, but internal conflict lacks visceral depth; his actions align with motivations but remain abstract without concrete emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot arcs from observation to realization with precision, but the leap from frost patterns to fireworks feels underdeveloped; the ending’s thematic resolution ties back cohesively despite rushed setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive setting with rich sensory details; the library’s ethereal quality and frost’s symbolism enhance mood, though the waterfall’s presence feels more fantastical flourish than narrative necessity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (fireworks as “ephemeral stories”) and subtext; the ending’s thematic payoff lingers. Some emotional beats (regret, acceptance) lean on abstraction rather than visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally wavers into ornate description (“veins conversing with frost”); the metaphor of time as a river feels familiar, though the frost-as-pathways motif is refreshingly tactile.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements merge into a cohesive, poetic whole; the brevity amplifies the ethereal theme. Minor tonal dissonance between the library’s mysticism and the grounded regret undermines unity slightly.</comment>
