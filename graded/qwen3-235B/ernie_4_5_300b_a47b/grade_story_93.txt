<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character’s arc is clear but underdeveloped; urgency of the crisis overshadows emotional nuance, leaving motivations more implied than deeply felt. The epiphany about connection arrives abruptly, lacking visceral emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing is taut yet strained; key plot beats (e.g., radio instructions) feel rushed, relying on expository dialogue to bridge gaps. The beginning-to-end coherence works within constraints but sacrifices lingering questions about the labyrinth’s mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Richly evoked but thinly explained: emergency lights, humming servers, and "sacred geometry" build a haunting tone, but the fusion of technology and natural patterns remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "geometry of survival") and symbolic resonance between birds and labyrinths elevate the story. However, the thematic conclusion feels slightly didactic rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Overall avoids cliché, though phrases like "desperate hope surged" and the trope of the absent mentor undermine originality. The blending of migratory data with architectural geometry is inventive but occasionally over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assignments like the archive and calling cards intertwine well with plot, but the resolution’s reliance on abstract metaphors risks reducing their narrative weight. The story’s ambition outpaces its ability to fully synthesize all elements cohesively.</comment>
