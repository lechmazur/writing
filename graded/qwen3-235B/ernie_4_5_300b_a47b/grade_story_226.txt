<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stated grief and obsession drive the plot but lack psychological depth; motivations feel simplified, reactions lack complexity despite the emotional premise. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative follows a clear arc but feels compressed; pacing falters in balancing exposition (Dr. Lira's disappearance) and action; tension resolves through abrupt transformation rather than earned consequence. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions anchor the uncanny tone (humming walls, spectral shadows), but worldbuilding shortcuts—like the unexplained resonance science—undermine immersion. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ending subverts nostalgia with existential dread; resonance as both literal plot device and metaphor for buried history works, though emotional beats rely partially on abstract declarations ("cold fire") rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (forbidden object corrupts seeker) with minimal subversion; the skull’s artificiality feels gimmicky; visceral imagery sometimes devolves into ornate vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Compelling central conceit (songs-as-danger) and lean prose succeed, but surface-level character psychology and underdeveloped elements (e.g., Dr. Lira) limit cohesion.</comment>
