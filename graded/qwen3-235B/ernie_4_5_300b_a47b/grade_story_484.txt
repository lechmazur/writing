<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear but thinly sketched; actions (protesting, confronting the mirror) align with his stated values but lack psychological complexity or evolution. Voice is stylistically distinct but doesn’t deeply flesh out personal history or nuanced conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc (entry, discovery, introspection, departure) but pacing feels compressed. The mirror’s role drives the action, though the thematic resolution risks feeling abrupt. Logical cause/effect missing in how the mirror’s supernatural elements connect to the protest’s influence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends eerie decay and protest sounds effectively, but the “haunted mansion” relies on generic Gothic tropes. Sensory details (hops, dust) are specific but unevenly distributed. The mansion’s symbolic role as fear of erasure is clear, but its physical world feels under-explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (mirror’s void, “static”) and thematic subtext about individualism vs. conformity resonate. Ending ties to a cathartic choice, but emotional payoff feels slightly generic. Metaphors are effective but not groundbreaking; the brewer’s “shards of the same mirror” conclusion leans on overused symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Attempts to subvert “haunted house” clichés with existential anxiety, but protests and corporate apathy feel trope-heavy. Prose avoids excessive ornamentation but occasionally sacrifices precision (e.g., “mansion grinned” strains credibility). Emotional showing is better than telling, though the final transformation of the staircase lacks grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements cohesively but not transcendentally. The protest’s interplay with the supernatural is intriguing but underdeveloped; themes of authenticity resonate but aren’t deeply interrogated. Memorable premise, but lacks the searing insight or stylistic daring needed for prestigious literary tiers.</comment>
