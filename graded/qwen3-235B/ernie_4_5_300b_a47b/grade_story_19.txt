<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character consistently embodies wildness and philosophical curiosity, but lacks depth beyond surface traits. Motivation to embrace uncertainty is clear but disconnected from personal history or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative flow exists but lacks traditional arc; relies heavily on thematic repetition rather than progression. Beginning/middle/end are blurred, diluting tension despite effective imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create immersive atmosphere, but the "feral" setting feels superficial—no distinct cultural, ecological, or temporal context to ground the world beyond poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and symbolic imagery ("feather against pebble") elevate thematic resonance. Ending achieves emotional resonance through subtext rather than explicit statement. Subtlety may alienate readers seeking narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise (communication via receipts) intrigued but underexplored. Some phrases ("drunk on pollen") verge on cliché. Emotional nuance avoids exposition but occasionally feels overwrought. Language generally purposeful but leans on ornate descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements serve the theme but strain believability—e.g., cryptic receipts lack narrative justification. Poetic quality overshadows plot logic. Lingering impression of "life’s chaos" is strong, but cohesion suffers under scrutiny.</comment>
