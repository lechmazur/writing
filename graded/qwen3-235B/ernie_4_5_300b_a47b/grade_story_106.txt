<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation rooted in his backstory and environment, with the quilt and stamps serving as physical manifestations of his inner conflict. The shift from nihilism to agency feels plausible if slightly rushed. Voice remains consistent throughout.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional arc despite tight word count. The use of stamps as catalysts feels earned through prior setup about his father. Ending resolution neatly mirrors opening conditions while showing transformation. Pacing falters slightly during power station awakening sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moody atmosphere created through tactile details (humming generators, rust) but underwater city setting isn't meaningfully exploited for narrative potential. The location and quilt's tactile qualities create memorable sensory contrasts but setting remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism through quilt-as-legacy and stamps-as-lost-opportunities. The tearing patch moment is viscerally rendered, with metaphor working both literally and thematically. Ending resonates by tying personal transformation to broader existential ideas about creating meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some fresh metaphors ("humming generators like waking corpse") but occasional purple prose ("stitched into oblivion"). Emotional progression shown through tangible actions rather than flat declarations. Quilt magic risks crossing into trope territory without sufficient grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements service each other more than story; underwater setting could be substituted without significant loss. Stamps/quilt connection is strongest thread. The theme of boundary-erasure resonates but execution prioritizes poeticism over narrative cohesion.</comment>
