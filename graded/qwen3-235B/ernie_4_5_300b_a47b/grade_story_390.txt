<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Weak motivation consistency; assassin's calm demeanor lacks psychological depth, and his nihilism feels imposed rather than organically tied to his role as a deceiver.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tightly structured around brief timeframe but lacks sufficient cause-effect momentum; ending resolves the immediate action but leaves overarching stakes unexamined.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is poetically rendered but setting remains superficial; palace's cultural specifics don't intersect meaningfully with the protagonist's actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric density creates lingering resonance; ending's irony about truth manipulation elevates craft, though subtext occasionally feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original use of botanical press and butterfly motif avoids clich√©s, but some metaphors (e.g., "whispers like moths") border on ornamental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Elements cohere into unified thematic whole; brevity enhances tension between ephemeral beauty and impermanent power, though character backstory remains frustratingly opaque.</grade>
