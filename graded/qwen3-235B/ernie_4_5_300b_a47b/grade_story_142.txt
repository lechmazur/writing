<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's broken aristocratic background and motivation are clear but interiority lacks depth; growth feels expedited rather than earned through nuanced reflection despite symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses via coherent cause/effect (lever-pulling activating ghosts/blueprints), but pacing feels compressed—the climax and thematic resolution occur too abruptly to fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park’s decay is vividly rendered (rusted coaster as "skeletal veins," ghostly echoes), but some descriptions verge on overwrought ("dissonant laughter") without fully distracting from immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like the orchid as legacy and coaster-as-class-divide are effective, but ending explanation of "resilience" leans on didacticism. Subtextual layers about land stewardship are present but unevenly balanced with plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept (recipes as botanical venation, ghosts as legacy-mirrors) distinguishes it, but reliance on "cursed heirloom" tropes and redemptive arc predictability reduce singularity. Avoids overt purple prose but occasionally drifts toward ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements (illustration/concessionaire secret/blueprint-revealing) creates thematic unity. Each assigned piece serves plot or symbolism, though the "parallel paths" timeframe is underutilized.</comment>
