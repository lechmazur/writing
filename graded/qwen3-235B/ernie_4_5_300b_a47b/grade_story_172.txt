<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivation and inconsistent internal logic; the character's actions lack emotional grounding despite atmospheric hints of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragmented momentum due to excessive conceptual density; the prophetic arc resolves too abstractly to feel fully earned, though structural symmetry between opening/closing images provides minimal cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically dissonant; while sensory details create haunting imagery (e.g., "salt and old stone"), the prophetic framework never fully integrates with the surreal coastal environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("reversed wish") undercut by didactic exposition; the philosophical tension between preservation/destruction is conceptually clear but emotionally distant due to limited character embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overpower psychological realism; while avoiding AI-like repetition, the narrative leans on poetic abstraction ("sharp gentleness") to compensate for underexplored human stakes and logical gaps in the prophetic mechanism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><comment>Conceptually ambitious but executionally uneven; the story's attempt to juxtapose the mundane (tour guide) with the mythic collapses under the weight of unearned symbolism and underdeveloped thematic payoffs.</comment>
