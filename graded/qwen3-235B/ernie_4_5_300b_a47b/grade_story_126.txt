<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Limited internal depth despite vivid external focus; motivation tied to symbolic opposition rather than layered human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Economical 400-word arc with functional progression, but the explosive climax feels truncated, weakening emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Haunting juxtaposition of dead star/generative technology; overreliance on “cracked glass” motifs slightly dilutes atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate psychologically (e.g., churn as cultural memory), but the “new seed: doubt” conclusion borders on didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some generic descriptors (“strange laughter”) undermine otherwise vivid specifics; avoids major AI tells but occasionally chooses abstraction over precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imperfectly executed but conceptually coherent synthesis of all elements; brevity serves the mythic tone rather than feeling restrictive.</comment>
