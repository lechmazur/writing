<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually tied to silence and rebellion but lacks psychological depth; motivation is hinted but underexplored, making emotional resonance sparse. Actions align with assigned traits but remain superficially rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; pivotal moments (hologram confrontation) lack build-up, straining coherence. Pacing effective but sacrifices nuance. Conflict resolution hinges on sudden action rather than organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Underwater city’s luminescent jellyfish clocks and algae-stained architecture create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details beyond sight are sparse. Setting enhances tone but insufficiently anchors plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., silence as control) and symbolic acts (moonshell ink) elevate theme. Ending’s reflection adds thematic closure, though emotional payoff remains subdued. Subtext about information warfare is compelling but underexploited.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding skirts clichés (submerged cities, runic hammers) but subverts through conceptual details (pressure sickness, bittersweet resistance). Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but retains stylistic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a self-contained vignette but leans heavily on implied lore. Assigned elements are integrated but unevenly weighted; some (e.g., timeframe) feel secondary rather than foundational. Leaves thematic questions but lacks visceral urgency.</comment>
