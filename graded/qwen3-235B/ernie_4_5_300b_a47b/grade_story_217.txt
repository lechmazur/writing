<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (rebel status) drives key decisions but lacks depth in exploring rebellion beyond defiance; knife's symbolic connection to adaptation is strong but rebel traits remain surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure connects beginning (call) to end (haunted house revival) but pacing feels compressed; the transformation's believability suffers slightly under time constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between decay (rusted gates, mold) and warmth (simmering spices) create immersive atmosphere; setting deeply informs character motivation and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (knife as adaptation) and subtext (food as emotional bridge) elevate impact; ending balances hope and melancholy effectively despite brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in combining haunted house with culinary revival exists, but overuse of "ephemeral" and some sentimental phrasing ("laughter a balm") veers toward generative clich√©s; emotional depth leans on explicit statements rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively uses most elements but relies heavily on sentimental beats; the haunting atmosphere and knife symbolism stand out more than other assigned components.</comment>
