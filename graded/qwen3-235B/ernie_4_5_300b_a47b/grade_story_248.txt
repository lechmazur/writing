<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth; Krell's anger and resolve drive action, but his internal conflict remains underexplored despite brief glimpses of complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a discernible arc but relies heavily on exposition; revelation through letters feels contrived despite tight pacing within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere and vivid sensory details (rust, fractured lights) immerse readers; the abandoned freighter enhances thematic isolation and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical treatment of "fate" and vivid imagery ("cheerless ecstasy") elevate themes; ending resonates as a defiance of false narratives.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with the automaton bird twist, but character reactions occasionally lean on abstraction rather than nuanced emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel utilitarian; thematic ambition exceeds emotional impact, leaving some assigned components under-exploited.</comment>
