<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Limited depth beyond insecurity as surface trait; motivations drive plot but lack internal complexity. The transformation from insecurity to certainty feels abrupt, undercutting psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tight structure struggles with compressed arc; key developments (realization, climax) feel rushed. The action-reaction chain is logical but lacks emotional buildup, relying on abrupt revelations. Pacing uneven in final act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambient decay effectively conveys isolation, but sensory details remain generic ("faded label," "stench of decay"). The "simmering future" concept isn't meaningfully integrated beyond name-checking.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("madness...closest companion") elevate the prose. Subverts expectations by recasting Elias as jailer rather than hero. The ending's thematic weight lands, but psychological stakes lack visceral impact due to underdeveloped inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("half-remembered missions and half-truths") and flat descriptions ("glowing neural pathways"). Subtle subtext (complicity in systems of control) emerges, but occasionally undercut by declarative emotional statements rather than immersive showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly. The twist adds resonance, yet brevity forces narrative shortcuts. Lingering questions about the agency's motives suggest depth but aren't fully dramatized within constraints.</comment>
