<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation connects to action but remains abstract; symbolic portrayal lacks human complexity. Motivation is clear but one-dimensionally tied to archetypal symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure prioritizes atmosphere over momentum; coherence relies on poetic logic rather than cause-and-effect clarity. Pacing deliberate but risks stagnation in midsection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dreamlike setting uses visceral sensory details effectively; atmosphere and concept merge through void's metaphorical decay. Timeframe's emotional tone occasionally overrides temporal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful thematic resonance through abstract symbolism; ending rewards reflection but lacks emotional payoff. Literary devices elevate craft, but some imagery feels self-consciously ornate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Weaves elements into cohesive whole but strains under pressure of multiple assigned constraints. Brief length feels restrictive rather than purposeful in thematic execution.</comment>
