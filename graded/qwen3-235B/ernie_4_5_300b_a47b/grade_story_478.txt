<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's midwifery ties loosely to her role as a memory-keeper; motivations are clear but lack nuanced development. Emotional reactions feel abrupt, lacking layered psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progression from ritual to revelation to resolution is logical but rushed. The connection between herbs and diaries feels artificially forced to serve the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (ember-light, herb smells) and setting (maelstrom's perpetual twilight) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that complements the tone. Occasionally overwritten, but evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and metaphor (e.g., herbs as "keys") elevate the narrative. The theme of memory-as-resistance resonates emotionally. Ending feels slightly telegraphed, reducing impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but leans on mystical midwife tropes. Some phrases ("swirling maelstrom") feel overfamiliar. Shows inventiveness in linking memory to botany but lacks distinctive stylistic precision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility (e.g., fire revealing legible diary fragments). The compressed length works conceptually but undercuts emotional payoff. Language occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism.</comment>
