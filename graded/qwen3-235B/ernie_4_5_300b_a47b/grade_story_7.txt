<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters and motives are present but underdeveloped; Elias' internal conflict between mercy and sacrificial purpose lacks depth despite poetic setup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels rushed—key transitions (e.g., moral dilemma at the nectar vat) lack sufficient narrative weight within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (ozone/honey, pulsating constellations) and ethereal tone create immersive atmosphere, though setting functions more as poetic backdrop than interactive force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imaginative symbolism (dolls as fractured lives, nectar as temporal/soul repair) elevates the story, but emotional resonance is undercut by opaque internal logic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality in cosmic-horror-meets-gothic-doll motifs and subversion of "healing" avoids clichés, though occasional ornate phrasing risks diluting tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but uneven—some (cane, star paths) drive the narrative; others (nectar's mechanics) feel decorative. Conceptual ambition outweighs execution.</comment>
