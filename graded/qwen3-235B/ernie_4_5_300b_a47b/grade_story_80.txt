<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symptomatic of strong quirks but limited emotional depth; her "clueless intuition" defines actions but lacks evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum falters between surreal imagery; cause/effect logical but compressed, sacrificing pacing cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly oppressive; sensory specifics (mildew, stardust) and uncanny settings elevate the eerie tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements integrate creatively; thematic resonance (choice vs. certainty) lingers, but constrained by brevity and overt explanation.</comment>
