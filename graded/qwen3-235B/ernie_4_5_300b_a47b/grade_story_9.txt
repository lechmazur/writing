<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice in dialogue but psychological complexity feels compressed; motivation is clear yet lacks emotional grounding in specific actions beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to action efficiently but resolution feels abrupt; the puzzle box mechanism provides structural scaffolding that barely contains the concept-driven narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pungent neon-soaked atmosphere dominates; billboard maze setting fused with environmental decay creates haunting visual logic; sensory details like ozone scent and tarnished mirror elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density (water rings as prophetic timelines, puzzle boxes as apocalypse counters) delivers intellectual resonance; final mirage-hologram image lingers powerfully; tone inconsistency weakens thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some striking phrases ("gravel in a blender" laughter) shine amid occasional purple prose tendencies; environmental stewardship treatment avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into polemic territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story maintains enough cohesion through its rich metaphor system and atmospheric unity; brevity amplifies poetic impact but strains character development and plot complexity.</comment>
