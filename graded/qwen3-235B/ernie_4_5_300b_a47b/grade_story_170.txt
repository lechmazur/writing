<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rough edges in character logic undermine impact; internal conflict is sincere but transitions between despair and resolve lack physiological nuance. The academically artistic attribute feels tacked on rather than organically integrated into behavior. The sewing acts as a weak metaphor for coral restoration—actions don't fully embody stated motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The plot structure shows significant strain under word constraints—too many unresolved narrative jumps (finding letters feels unearned). The "memorize" action drives the story but creates artificial drama. The ending arrives through thematic convenience rather than emotional inevitability. Pacing lurches between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually striking details impress (seafoam threads, coral veins as poetry) but fail to build consistent atmosphere. The coral station's sensory environment is underutilized beyond basic worldbuilding. Timeframe connection to wall completion creates strong spatial logic but only surface-level psychological context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor clusters (doubt as salt-winged creature, heart as compass) elevate craft significantly. The central metaphorical thesis works cohesively, though some lyrical passages sacrifice clarity. The ending provides satisfying thematic closure but could explore more subtextual tension between science/art.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-generated pitfalls with concrete images (cerulean sutures, grandmother's laughter in shells), but several phrases flirt with purple prose ("breathless longing of something wild"). Emotional progression relies too heavily on direct statement ("hollow echoes gone") rather than earned revelation through action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Concept integration feels strained at points—assembled rather than organically unified. The thematic throughline exists but lacks refinement. The coral station concept demonstrates creative thinking while the letters device borders on contrived. Ends with lingering feeling but requires generous suspension of disbelief for full coherence.</comment>
