<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marla's reincarnation ties to her guilt, but the seven lifetimes are glossed over. Her motivation is clear but underexplored; while the toy soldier symbolizes her regret, its personal history feels vague. Dialogue hints at her voice but lacks distinct rhythm beyond "playful cynicism."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-driven plot is efficient, with the chef's arrival and the recipe experiment forming a cohesive arc. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in the transformation scene. The ending ties back to Marla's agency, though the thematic resolution feels abrupt despite fitting within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The algae-stained library is atmospheric but underexploited; sensory details (e.g., the stew's "sharp aroma") are sparse. The storm enhances tension, but the connection between the decaying recipes and Marla's guilt could be more visceral. The gills and aquatic imagery hint at deeper lore never fully unpacked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of guilt as a culinary ingredient is inventive and layered. The soldier-turned-utensil symbolizes growth, and the ending's thematic punch—"disruption as seasoning"—avoids didacticism. Dialogue is sharp but minimal; emotional resonance emerges through subtext rather than stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichéd "redemption through cooking" tropes by blending surrealism with introspection. The prose is purposeful but occasionally strains under metaphor-heavy lines ("ghost stories" for recipes). The emotional logic feels human, though the chef's sudden investment in Marla's relic strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The story weaves its elements without collapsing, though some (timeframe, tentative fierceness) are more implied than developed. The brevity works for its concept but sacrifices deeper exploration. Lingering questions about Marla's cycles hint at depth but leave gaps in her transformation's permanence.</comment>
