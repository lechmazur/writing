<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is mostly clear but some internal shifts feel underexplored; the "softly militant" trait isn't consistently demonstrated through actions; the late-blooming aspect needs more emotional preparation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong forward propulsion through key actions; some secondary plot points (e.g., attic discovery) feel slightly expedited; narrative arc complete but could deepen thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details create palpable atmosphere; setting enhances both character and theme; the post-apocalyptic rooftop farm could integrate more deeply with cosmic balance concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through understated imagery; strong symbolic use of spyglass and roots; ending slightly sentimental; some exposition-heavy sections detract from "showing" principle.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Few original metaphors (e.g., "frayed like hemp rope") but "auroras no one had seen" feels fresh; some risk of purple prose in descriptions; emotional subtext feels human but formal language occasionally distances.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</comment>Blends assigned elements cohesively but not transcendentally; writing style serves story without distinctive authorial fingerprint; brief length feels purposeful but misses opportunities for deeper thematic interconnection.</comment>
