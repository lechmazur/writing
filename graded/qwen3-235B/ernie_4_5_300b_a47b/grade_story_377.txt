<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strength in aligning Veyra's digital nature with her desire for tactile experience, but emotional depth feels somewhat abstract and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from quiet curiosity to public revelation, but the compressed timeline and abrupt climax resolution feel rushed in places.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Library's hidden history and sensory details (whirring seismograph, brass barometer) create haunting atmosphere, though some elements (e.g., secret society rules) lack full contextualization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in blending tech-mysticism (code interpreting seismic data) and subverting "sentient AI" tropes, but occasional abstract phrasing risks sounding slightly formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements like the seismograph’s role in decoding silence and the holographic exhibit’s symbolic weight show seamless integration of constraints into meaningful narrative.</comment>
