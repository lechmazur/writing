<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fails to fully explore the psychological complexity behind the planner’s transformation. Motivational threads (betrayal vs. self-redemption) remain underdeveloped; the shift from desperation to revelation feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot's symbolic arc (shattered object → hidden passage) is coherent, but compressed timeline between deal and escape strains plausibility. Climactic discovery lacks sufficient buildup within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sandalwood, humming hymns) create mood, but setting remains superficial. The temple’s cultural specificity and bioluminescent garden lack integration into thematic logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphor of fragmented guidance systems (blotter, constellations, temple fissures) deepens philosophical resonance. Ending’s thematic subversion—doubt as a chain—elevates narrative, though emotional beats occasionally lean on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in blending apocalyptic prepper tropes with mythic symbolism, but overwritten imagery (“smoldering coals” eyes) and forced metaphors (“petal that pulsed like a heartbeat”) veer into pretension. Character psychology risks being subsumed by aesthetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity through fragmentation motifs, though some elements (e.g., oligarch) feel extraneous. Brevity enhances the elliptical tone but sacrifices deeper exploration of the garden’s symbolic stakes.</comment>
