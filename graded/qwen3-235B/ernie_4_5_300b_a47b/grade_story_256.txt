<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Marlowe’s poetic past and loyalty to the cafe are thematically clear but underdeveloped; his motivations (chasing the horizon) feel abstract rather than rooted in tangible conflict or personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The plot hinges on thematic revelation, but the "action" (stepping off the cafe) lacks narrative progression or tension; cohesion exists, but the arc feels overly conceptual and static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The floating cafe and midnight setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("neon flickering like lullaby in amber," "laughter muffled by unspoken longings"), creating a haunting atmosphere that amplifies the story’s existential tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("time’s edges," "measuring the distance between here and there") and lyrical prose elevate the story; the open-ended resolution invites reflection, though subtlety occasionally verges on obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés (floating cafe, poetic guard) but leans on abstract introspection; the typewriter rhythm motif feels somewhat forced, and dialogue’s poetic tone risks distancing readers seeking emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Successfully blends surreal elements into a cohesive meditation on time and longing; however, the brevity and ethereal tone may undermine emotional resonance for readers craving concrete narrative stakes.</comment>
