<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lack of distinct character voice; reaper’s actions align with "heartbroken" but inner logic remains abstract and thinly sketched despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves from entry to exit with resolution, but structural coherence is strained by elliptical phrasing that obfuscates cause-effect (e.g., connection between manuscript, seeds, and "hidden springs" remains hazy).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details (damp parchment, groaning shelves) immerse readers, though the cave’s symbolic connection to "heartbreak/healing" occasionally feels imposed rather than organically linked to the narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("relationships as seeds," "heart as tomb") and symbolic resonance of drowned poet's manuscript create layered thematic impact. Ending delivers emotional payoff without overstatement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrases ("softly thunderous heart") verge on pretentious, but generally avoids formulaic structures. Emotional shifts feel earned rather than stated, balancing lyrical prose with psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements function collaboratively but imperfectly—manuscript and seeds elevate the narrative, while "mapping hidden springs" feels vaguely defined despite thematic importance to the arc.</comment>
