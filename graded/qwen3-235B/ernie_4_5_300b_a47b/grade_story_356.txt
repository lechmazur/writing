<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's wryness and aloofness surface through terse dialogue and introspective gestures but lack deeper exploration of how these traits shape his practical role as "caretaker." Motivation against "what ifs" is clear but emotional nuance remains implied rather than viscerally rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plotted with poetic logic: phone's failure catalyzes introspective arc. Pacing balances introspection and action within tight word count, though the transition from chalk-drawing to resolution feels slightly compressed, diluting the climax's weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alien decay and distorted gravity vividly externalize the protagonist's fractured sense of time. Sensory details (chalk dust, humming engines) immerse readers, though space pirate context doesn't deepen thematic tensions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as "liar," chalk as existential countermeasure) resonate. The "show, don't tell" approach through tactile gestures (broken chalk, vent-toss) amplifies emotional impact. Ending's thematic heft lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evades genre traps: chalk-tracing as cloud-path method feels original, not trope-reliant. Avoids excessive stylization; subtext about lying to time feels human. Some abstract phrases ("phantom trails") border on overwrought but remain purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements interlock: chalk's fragility mirrors temporal distortions; setting's instability mirrors psychological terrain. The brief form feels deliberate, with the final image of drifting chalk dust echoing the theme of impermanence.</comment>
