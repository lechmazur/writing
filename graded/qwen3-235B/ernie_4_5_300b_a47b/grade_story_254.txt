<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's internal struggle is palpable but underdeveloped; motivations (resentment toward father, professional failure) are clear but lack textured exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot is minimally structured but coherent; the shift from frustration to acceptance feels rushed despite tight word count, reliant on abstract introspection over concrete progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric and thematically integrated; sensory details (rusted swings, bleeding sunset) enhance emotional tone but occasionally overwork metaphors.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; brevity sacrifices depth, yet lingering questions about legacy and redemption hint at subtextual richness.</comment>
