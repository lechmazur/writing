<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (preserve caves, internalize past), but necromancer traits lack depth; reactions to objects (cap, film) reveal inner conflict but could delve deeper into nuanced emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (nostalgic longing → film-inspired resolve), but corporate threat feels underdeveloped; pacing is tight yet some transitions (e.g., projector memories to hologram) lack grounding in the logic of the world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave’s bioluminescence and stillness create immersive visuals, but sensory details (e.g., projector sound) are inconsistently integrated; futuristic nostalgia is evocative but occasionally undercut by underexplored connections (e.g., necromancy’s role in the ecosystem).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (cap as relic, film as bridge) and circular structure (resolution through storytelling) elevate impact; subtext about preserving memory through narrative is potent, though emotional beats occasionally rely on direct statements rather than layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Blends necromancer trope with preservation, subverts “magic for resurrection” expectation; avoids clichés but leans on nostalgia-as-motif, which risks feeling familiar; language is purposeful but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing (“prismatic fractals”) that distracts from raw emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (map-making, nostalgia, preservation) but uneven execution weakens cohesion; the brevity serves thematic focus, yet underexplored tensions (e.g., necromancer’s societal role) and abrupt thematic shifts limit lasting impact.</comment>
