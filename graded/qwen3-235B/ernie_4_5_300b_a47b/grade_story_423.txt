<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character depth limited to archetype; motivations through riddle and child memory feel insufficiently nuanced, though the latter connects to action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Puzzle-driven structure works within word limit, but climax feels abrupt; resolution is thematically satisfying but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively with minor friction; story transcends "quest" framework through nuanced thematic fusion of science/art, decay/rebirth.</comment>
