<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters have clear traits but motivations lack psychological depth; internal conflict about identity is hinted at but underexplored, with transformation feeling somewhat perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative structure lacks tension dynamics; pivotal decisions like rebellion feel underdeveloped, though the circular use of "rebirth" concept provides minimal arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Crater setting creates strong visual foundation but atmospheric details are inconsistently applied; sensory elements occasionally evoke lunar reality but fall short of immersive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (fungus, crumbling photograph) resonate thematically; emotional impact diluted by overreliance on abstract description rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uses some overfamiliar rebellion tropes; poetic language occasionally devolves into abstraction, but symbolic integration of lunar ecology with personal liberation shows distinctive thinking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Coherence maintained but lacks narrative electrification; assigned elements function technically without achieving transcendent unity or lingering resonance beyond surface themes.</comment>
