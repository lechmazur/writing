<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation to rescue traditions is clear but underdeveloped; "aggressively kind" is stated more than demonstrated through concrete actions. The observer's reactions to the whistle and whale call hint at depth but remain abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from anticipation to act of destruction/resurrection, but the dancer's footfall framing device creates confusion about chronology. The fling-the-whistle action drives momentum, though pacing feels compressed rather than graceful in the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt-stained glass, whale-call vibrations) create immersion. The lighthouse's abandonment and haunting by "spectral memories" masterfully support the theme of lost traditions. However, the dancer's stage setting feels tacked on rather than integrated thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The metaphor of breaking glass to free trapped wisdom resonates thematically. Subtext about cultural preservation through radical acts works well, but emotional impact is dampened by the character's distance. The whale dirge-to-whispers transition evokes strong imagery and layered meaning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but occasionally leans into flowery phrasing ("fractured stars" for glass shards). Metaphors like the whale's call as ancient stone are fresh, but the unseen, nameless observer risks feeling like a generic "mystic figure." The "aggressively kind" attribute strains toward originality but remains underexploited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story coheres at the sentence level but feels fragmented conceptually—how do dancers and lighthouses connect? The brevity enhances some mystical atmosphere but leaves many assigned elements (dancer's timeframe, whale method) feeling like puzzle pieces that don't fully lock together.</comment>
