<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character actions/reactions deeply tied to core traits; integration of motivation with symbolic elements (mirrors/masks) nuanced and consistent. Elias' voice and introspective depth anchor the narrative despite minimal dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by compressed arc, but clear progression from isolation to partial belonging. Pacing mostly controlled, though "jigsaw puzzles" timeframe device feels underexplored. Narrative resolution feels earned but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and thematically resonant (greenhouse humidity, chlorophyll screams), but plant communication remains more setting than active plot driver. Sensory details rich but occasionally stylized to the point of distancing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (masks, mirrors, soil) creates layered thematic impact. Dialogue is sparse but potent. The ending crystallizes the central paradox of fragmented wholeness with emotional resonance and elegant circularity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original approach to war trauma and renewal; avoids clich√©s through surreal juxtaposition (carbonized history, chlorophyll screams). Some phrasing edges toward poetic abstraction but maintains a distinctive voice throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative cohesively despite high concept density. Brevity enhances thematic focus rather than limiting it. The fusion of war trauma with plant communication and artistic reconstruction demonstrates inventive synthesis rather than formulaic structure.</comment>
