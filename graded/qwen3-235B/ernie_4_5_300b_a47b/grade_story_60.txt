<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation driven by past trauma is poignant but underexplored; emotional resonance is present but limited by narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed in the final transformation; cause-effect logic is sound but lacks deeper elaboration due to constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive with tactile, evocative details; setting and tone interlace seamlessly in service of theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolism (e.g., ribbon as ancestral memory, moss as life’s persistence) elevate the narrative; the ending resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imaginative choices (e.g., bioluminescent moss) avoid cliché; emotional beats are shown more than told, though the “covenant with the past” risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize cohesively despite the tight word limit; the story conveys layered meaning without over-explanation, leaving lingering reflection.</comment>
