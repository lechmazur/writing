<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Complex motivations (doomed love, preservation of craft) influence actions, but inner conflicts underdeveloped. Subtle physical gestures convey more than interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise and resolution connect through keys/bell motif, but pacing compresses pivotal emotional beats and chase sequence into too few words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in conflicting spaces (sterile studio vs. artisan underbelly) enhances melancholic nostalgia and thematic tension between progress and preservation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Song-as-resistance metaphor resonates; bell-key symbiosis creates haunting symbolism. Some thematic clarity sacrificed to lyricism in final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through tactile worldbuilding (key textures, glass-vial harmonics). Occasional overwritten similes ("air hummed with parchment/metal") border on poetic redundancy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Technical polish and haunting motifs elevate constrained format. Emotional distance in final act prevents full thematic resonance with star-birth timeframe.</comment>
