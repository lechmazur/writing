<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters are distinct but lack depth; motivations (cosmic interpretation vs. logic) are clear but under-explored. Dialogue reveals traits but feels performative rather than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hazily cyclical structure; conflict escalates but resets without resolution. Cause-effect (e.g., stamp’s activation) remains underdeveloped. Pacing uneven in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (neon vs. bioluminescence) create a singular atmosphere. Setting’s fusion of retrofitted stables and tech feels intentionally symbolic but slightly over-designed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uses metaphor well (cosmos vs. data), but thematic subtext lacks complexity. Ending gestures at cyclical recurrence but doesn’t fully satisfy as closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by familiar archetypes (artist vs. scientist). Avoids excessive ornament, but some phrases (“whispers of the universe”) verge on generic. Tension feels artificially sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</question><comment>Cohesive as a vignette but lacks tension-to-resolution arc typical of publishable work. Elements are cleverly assigned but not fully integrated into a unified artistic vision.</comment>
