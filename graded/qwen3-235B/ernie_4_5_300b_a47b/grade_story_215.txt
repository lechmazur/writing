<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coy aggression shown in dialogue with Ren but 'rattled' exorcist aspect underexplored. Motivation for merging science with wonder clear but not deeply rooted in demonstrated past trauma. Social nature mentioned, not dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Puzzle sequence lacks organic connection to psychic setting—the organ note’s acoustic properties solving physical locks strain plausibility. Dance lesson thuds disrupt pacing but provide needed context for humming frequency. Strong resolution but slightly rushed final synthesis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mix of 1920s occultism and modern science creates intriguing contrasts. Sensory details (humming organ, prism light) effective but sparse. Dance studio's dissonant rhythm adds uniqueness without full integration into atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dialogue's thematic tension between empiricism and mysticism resonates. Ending's ectoplasm revelation embodies "show don't tell." Lacks lingering emotional complexity despite clever resolution. Central conflict resolved too neatly for literary prestige standards.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through scientific framing (psychic resonance equations). Ren’s grudging respect avoids predictable conversion. Some procedural flatness in puzzle mechanics. Writing avoids purple prose but occasionally under-imagines (e.g., vague "cryptic message").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High-concept elements (dance studio/organ puzzles) showcase creativity but integration feels pragmatic rather than organic. Ending achieves thematic synthesis but lacks subtextual richness. Conceptual ambition exceeds emotional depth.</comment>
