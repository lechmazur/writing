<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's phobia is present but inconsistently physicalized; motivations (fractured psyche vs. "dancing on the edge of madness") occasionally contradict rather than deepen; reliance on traumatic flashbacks risks reductionism but shows emotional progression through tactile interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains circularity (entering pyramid/leaving transformed), but the unraveling action's metaphysical effects lack concrete grounding; revelation through auditory echoes feels strained; causality between knot-unraveling and character epiphany hinges on abstract connections rather than dramatized progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (mildew, sagging shelves, desert sun) create a hauntingly tactile atmosphere; setting's ancient decay mirrors protagonist's psychological state; tone of numb fascination permeates descriptions but occasionally undermines emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (knots=mind, net as ghostly conduit) elevate thematic resonance; ending's thematic synthesis is moving but slightly over-explains through explicit "knots/threads" analogy; emotional impact relies more on imagery than dialogue, which remains sparse but purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stunt double premise risks clich√© (trauma-as-backstory trope); spiritual residue belief borders on New Age vagueness; sensory details like the mother's morphine-muffled line feel authentic but narrowly avoid melodrama; metaphors occasionally become repetitive ("echoes," "threads").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements (pyramid, net, garage sales) feel conceptually rich but inconsistently interwoven; the stunt double profession doesn't fully earn its place in the narrative arc; thematic cohesion in final revelation partially compensates for structural fissures inherent in compressed format.</comment>
