<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters' motivations are clear but lack depth; the exile's pain underlies their actions, but the bond forms too abruptly. Their dialogue conveys thematic resonance but feels slightly rushed in emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the reliance on contrived coincidence (snowstorm encounter) weakens plausibility. Pacing manages brevity well but leaves character dynamics underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through precise, tactile descriptions (cold, dust, sound of the storm). The abandoned customs office's decay mirrors the characters' internal states, enhancing emotional stakes through environmental symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Story evokes profound melancholy and hope via layered metaphors (mortar as healing, snow as isolation). The ending provides thematic satisfaction while leaving enough ambiguity for reflection, avoiding oversimplification of emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Contains original imagery (e.g., "wind chimes in a gale") but relies on familiar tropes (star-crossed royalty, magical object as salvation). Some phrasing borders on ornate ("familiar unknown"), though the mortar's symbolic function offers fresh emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence and atmosphere compensate for predictable structure. Assigned elements integrate logically, though the forced encounter and underexplored setting reduce the impression of uniqueness within tight constraints.</comment>
