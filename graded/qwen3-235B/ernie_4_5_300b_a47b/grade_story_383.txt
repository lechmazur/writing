<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization delves into Voss’s haunted past but lacks nuance in secondary character depth; the woman’s dialogue often feels didactic rather than organically revealing her own complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative flows cleanly within constraints, but the photos as plot devices feel slightly contrived to force thematic resolution, undermining organic tension in the compact structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (neon’s glow, seaweed’s texture) create a hauntingly surreal atmosphere that mirrors internal conflicts, though the setting’s cosmic scale occasionally overshadows intimate character work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (fear as diner cook, arcs as lies) are striking but occasionally over-explained; the child’s drawing and seaweed motif carry weight, though emotional beats risk being schematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in the synthesis of sci-fi noir and philosophical themes, though the woman’s whimsical resolution leans on familiar “trauma redemption” tropes, slightly softening the edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Cohesion elevates the package; elements like seaweed and arcs intertwine thematically, though the brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of the woman’s own arc or the setting’s implications.</grade>
