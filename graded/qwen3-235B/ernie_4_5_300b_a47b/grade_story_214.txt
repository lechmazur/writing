<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rounded edges on character's grief suggest depth, but emotional granularity remains cursory beneath poetic veneer. Voice lacks roughness befitting a trapper's inner monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure (beginning/end with sea glass) achieves symmetry, but decoding montage feels compressed. Microfilm-to-hologram progression lacks intermediate stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Observatory's biomechanical details create textured environment, though "tidal wars" and "indifferent cosmos" occasionally tip into cosmic pretension rather than earned atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering of black holes/grief works beautifully. Hologram twist adds emotional resonance. Occasional sentimentality undercuts subtext potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evasive of genre tropes - trapper's technical patience against cosmic existentialism feels fresh. Sensory specificity (mildew/desperation) avoids AI sterility. Some adverbial clutter remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element density occasionally overwhelms character momentum. Microfilm archive's mildew desperation works; "floating observatory" risks conceptual overload without more contextual grounding.</comment>
