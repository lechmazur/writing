<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's nobility isn't strongly established; "dazed" state lacks emotional anchoring. Motivation for merging logic/madness is consistent but underexplored beyond surface declarations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but rushes redemption from dazedness to clarity. Causality exists but pivotal moments lack psychological or contextual depth due to brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Composer's garden creates vivid, multisensory atmosphere. Wind chimes, chalk dust, and fading sky create a liminal space that powerfully mirrors themes of merging order and chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "serpent of reason devouring its tail") and thematic fusion of science/myth elevate the narrative. Emotional resonance is present but occasionally diluted by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; combines scientific and poetic ideas inventively. Some phrases ("exhale," "tectonic plates") veer toward familiar poetic devices rather than radical originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are mostly well-integrated, but the sound garden and nobility feel optional. The core concept persists in memory, though execution lacks the transcendent impact implied by its closing grandeur.</comment>
