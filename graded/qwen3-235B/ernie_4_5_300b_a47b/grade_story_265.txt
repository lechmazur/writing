<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's impassive nature is visually established but lacks psychological depth; motivations hinted through ritual but remain cryptic, creating distance rather than engagement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Episodic structure with atmospheric peaks but minimal narrative tension; the ritual's resolution feels abrupt and undercontextualized within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Richly evoked cathedral-overrun-by-orchard imagery creates mesmerizing dissonance; time management of "oil changes" feels arbitrarily juxtaposed rather than integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "bees as stained glass" and the resonant final hum imprint lingering questions; theme of accessible transcendence through mundane rituals feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original premise executed with tactile specificity; occasional phrase clusters like "secret language of bees" border on formulaic, but atmospheric cohesion maintains distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Moments of lyrical brilliance coexist with structural unevenness; successfully transforms constraints into thematic elements but doesn't fully transcend their inherent awkwardness.</comment>
