<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Intertwining storm-chasing and blacksmithing backgrounds with character's motivation creates depth, but internal voice lacks complexity; grandfather's influence is pivotal yet slightly underexplored emotionally</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Carousel restoration drives plot with logical cause-effect; pacing tightens impact despite compressed word count, though monks’ arc feels underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Alpine monastery’s frigid decay vividly mirrors character’s task; sensory details (snow on stone, ghostly horses) immerse readers, though desert connection remains superficial</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (celestial clock, "act of mending") elevate thematic weight; ending resonates as emotional culmination rather than exposition</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original in concept (mending as strength) and execution; some phrases ("whirred," "reclaimed joy") approach lyricism without veering into excessive ornamentation</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohere thematically; desert/storm chaser thread feels like narrative garnish, but core motifs unify into a meditation on preservation</comment>
