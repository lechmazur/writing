<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's philosophical contradictions intrigue, but motivations lack nuance. The plush object's symbolic weight feels unearned despite atmospheric touches.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from tight constraints: thematic pivot (children's laughter â†’ moral reflection) feels abrupt, yet the villain's-epic structure holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent coral city creates vivid atmosphere; kelp-lined avenues and algae-stained towers create immersive dissonance between beauty and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Provocative theme of moral relativism resonates through inverted mythology; prose occasionally favors cleverness over emotional truth in tighter spaces.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Weaves all required elements cohesively; brief length works thematically, though pivotal moments (jellyfish children, plush abandonment) lack narrative breathing room.</comment>
