<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has a clear arc but motivations shift abruptly without emotional depth; inner conflict is shown through objects but lacks nuanced psychological exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight pacing within constraints, but the pivotal decision lacks sufficient setup; concept and action interconnect but resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (rotting metal, whispering mannequins) create visceral, cohesive atmosphere that deepens thematic concerns of decay and beauty.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "star learning to forgive") and layered subtext elevate impact; some emotional beats could be more subtly handled rather than explicitly stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI traps: metaphors are specific, tone consistent, and voice distinctive. Occasional stock phrases ("shattering glass") and overwrought line ("fierce grin") detract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work in concert to explore theme; the story's brevity enhances rather than constrains its purpose. Conceptual ambition slightly outpaces emotional execution.</comment>
