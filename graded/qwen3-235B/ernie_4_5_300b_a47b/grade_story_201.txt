<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's impulsiveness and whimsy shape actions and dialogue, but motivation for resolving a historical wrong lacks psychological depth; emotional inheritance is stated rather than meaningfully dramatized through layered choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot driven by clear cause-effect (stars → rhythm → music → revelation), but climax feels rushed; fortress's reaction to music strains plausibility despite fantastical logic; arc resolved within constraint but with underdeveloped transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (waterfall, dusk) deepen motif of ephemerality, but lack tactile specificity (e.g., textures of moss, temperature shifts); atmosphere reinforces tone but insufficiently ties to character's tactile experience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mixes lyrical metaphors ("melancholy as a metronome") with clichéd expressions ("whispers of a cursed melody"); ending provides emotional closure but underdevelops complexity beneath themes of legacy and improvisation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blends poetic imagery with accessible prose but succumbs to ornate metaphors ("dusk bled into violet") that occasionally distract; emotional inheritance explored superficially through stated connections rather than subtext; character reactions occasionally lean on whimsy as shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere through recurring motifs but vary in narrative necessity; fortress and sheet music are indispensable, while shooting stars as a metronome concept feels algorithmically convenient rather than organically integrated.</comment>
