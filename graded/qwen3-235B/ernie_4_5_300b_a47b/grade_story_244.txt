<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear motivation but lacks deeper exploration of the character's internal conflict and specific past events. The swordswoman identity is present but underdeveloped in emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect and complete arc within constraints, but the sudden shopkeeper reveal feels underprepared. Pacing maintains momentum but sacrifices some nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Richly textured setting with vivid sensory details, but the garden's abrupt shift disrupts cohesion. Atmospheric elements strongly enhance tone but unevenly connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic motifs and evocative imagery elevate impact, but some emotional beats rely on explicit stating rather than subtext. Ending resonates thematically but lacks full emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original setting elements counteract genre clich√©s effectively, but the guilty swordswoman trope and "map of regret" dialogue echo familiar patterns. Language occasionally over-ornamented without adding depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive theme exploration of guilt and liberation anchors the story. Some underexplored elements (sword's history) don't detract from overall effectiveness. Ending delivers satisfying thematic weight despite minor pacing quirks.</comment>
