<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works within word constraints but lacks narrative tension; thematic resolution through "waiting for light" feels underdeveloped despite lyrical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive but thematically inconsistentâ€”abandoned carnival and drone elements exist in uneasy juxtaposition; sensory details elevate the setting but logic between elements falters.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "chorus of lost and found" are evocative but occasionally undercut by poetic abstraction; emotional resonance is potent yet unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original atmosphere avoids overt tropes but occasionally veers into mannered prose; the transient realities theme distinguishes it from formulaic storytelling despite uneven character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion salvaged by vivid imagery and cyclical structure but weakened by underexplored character arcs and passive narrative momentum.</comment>
