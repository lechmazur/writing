<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character traits (muscle, poet’s heart) surface in key moments but lack emotional depth. Motivation hinges on vague myth-making, insufficiently driving actions like map assembly. Disturbing calmness contrasts effectively with violence but isn't woven into decision-making logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing uneven—map-assembly tension resolves abruptly, resurrection twist comes suddenly. Drum solos influence atmosphere but not plot mechanics. Plot relies on dreamlike logic over coherent cause/effect, weakening narrative momentum despite strong central image of the baton's unintended power.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details (skeletal roses smelling of bones, drumbeats as heartbeat) create immersive dread. Setting works symbiotically with tone—thorned plants reflect character's "brash tenderness." Too many unexplained rules (sap jaws, shifting corridors) disrupt internal logic slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sustained metaphor of silence as language; subverts resurrection tropes with haunting "absence" twist. Voice remains consistent—lyrical yet precise. Emotional impact from final laughter and unspoken recognition of altered reality shows mastery of subtext. Minor lapses into ornateness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids horror clichés through hybrid elements (drum-controlled carnivorous flora). Gardener's sudden map fragment undermines nuance; baton’s translation mechanics remain opaque. Figurative language (dissecting dandelion stem) impresses but occasional excess ("thundering drum solos") weakens impact. Conceptual boldness outweighs flaws.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Weaves disparate elements into cohesive mythic framework. Strengths in thematic layering and atmospheric control compensate for predictable structural beats (twist formula) and uneven cause/effect. Ambiguous ending invites reflection but risks feeling underdeveloped. Style occasionally hinders clarity but supports poetic tone.</comment>
