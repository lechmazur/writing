<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth beyond surface resolve; external traits tie to actions but personal stakes remain underexplored. Jabbering shows isolation but isn't fully integrated into his persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on underexplained mechanics (cards' magic, abrupt environmental shifts). Some logical gaps in cause/effect (map's origin) undermine coherence within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with sensory language, but mystical elements (glowing moss) feel disconnected from setting's apocalyptic logic. Tone is haunting yet occasionally inconsistent (e.g., "raw solace" underdeveloped).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic execution of rebirth/freedom through symbols (cards, seeds). Metaphors are vivid but ending leans slightly on telling ("boundaries erased") rather than immersive subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Subverts genre tropes with magic-infused farming but relies on predictable devices (map in bottle). Language avoids ornamentation but some descriptors ("ash-kissed") verge on formulaic. Subtext present but not fully penetrating.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>Elements create functional cohesion but lack radical integration (e.g., Council as flat antagonist). Story's brevity serves the narrative but prevents deeper exploration of core themes beyond surface symbolism.</grade>
