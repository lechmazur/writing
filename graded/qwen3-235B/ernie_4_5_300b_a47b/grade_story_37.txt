<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maribel's "dishonestly honest" trait is well-illustrated through her paradoxical actions (stealing but leaving poems), but her overarching motivation for becoming a "guardian of tomorrow’s flame" feels underexplored and abstract, weakening the emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The plot hinges on quiet moments rather than urgent action. The detour to the canopy village and its connection to the construction zone lacks narrative significance. The ending feels abrupt, requiring more payoff for the "gradual revelations" implied by the core concept.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rainforest canopy village is rendered with visceral, original imagery (e.g., bulldozers as "impatient termites," a mustache like a "question mark"). The juxtaposition of fragile beauty against industrial ruin creates a haunting, tactile atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("heart beating like a drum solo") and subtext (environmentalism as metaphor for inherited legacy) elevate the story. However, the ending leans on the sentimental lyric too heavily, undermining subtler thematic threads.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some descriptions border on decorative excess ("woven rattan chair"), and Maribel’s dialogue occasionally feels overly stylized ("Earnest whimsy"). The choir’s tree-singing is inventive but underexplored, hinting at structural gaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story balances lyrical prose with a resonant theme (preservation vs. progress) and a vivid setting. However, the brevity leaves character arcs and thematic connections (e.g., Maribel’s mother, her medical test) underdeveloped.</comment>
