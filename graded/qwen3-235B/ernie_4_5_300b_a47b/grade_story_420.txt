<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character complexity is present but surface-level; motivations are clear but not deeply nuanced. Internal conflict is implied but thinly developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but pacing feels occasionally compressed. Logical throughlines between action and resolution exist but lack subtle transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered but occasionally detached from emotional undercurrents. Sensory details are strong but unevenly integrated with thematic goals.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Literary devices are effective but occasionally overt. Thematic resonance (failure as method) is strong, though layered subtext is underdeveloped. Ending earns its emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept execution, but some metaphors skirt generic abstraction ("restless shadows"). Emotional beats rely on understatement over formulaic exposition, with minor purple prose risks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story integrates most elements cohesively, though timeframe and tone remain underutilized. Execution shows ingenuity, but some assigned components feel lightly engaged.</comment>
