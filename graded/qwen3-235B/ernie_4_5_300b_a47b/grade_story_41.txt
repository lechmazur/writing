<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (rebellion against constraints), but emotional depth remains thin—Mara's internal conflict is stated more than embodied. Cosmic powers feel tacked on as a tool rather than an organic part of her identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from ritual to revelation, but the starlight bridge materializing lacks narrative scaffolding. Pacing stumbles slightly in the transition from ritual to transcendence, straining plausibility within the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and original—blending industrial decay with cosmic mysticism via sensory details (ozone, groaning gears). Gargoyles and abyss create tangible dread, though the setting occasionally leans on overused Gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("ordered disarray," "sugar in rain") and resonant closing lines elevate the story. The central conflict and theme (tradition vs. reinvention) are cohesive, though dialogue/inner monologue feels sparse despite the first-person-adjacent narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The brooch ritual and cosmic powers avoid cliché through poetic framing, but the "bottomless abyss" and "supernova eyes" verge on genre laziness. Emotional resonance is achieved through imagery more than nuanced character interiority, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly seamless but occasionally over-explain (e.g., "ordered disarray isn't chaos. It's choice"). The ending lingers effectively, though the factory-as-prison metaphor feels slightly overfamiliar despite its cosmic twist.</comment>
