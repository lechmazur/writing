<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's apathy is consistent and informs his lazy yet clever problem-solving, but the lack of meaningful internal conflict or nuanced emotional resonance limits depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through the coffee grinder's mechanical interaction with frames, but the resolution feels rushed despite a coherent arc within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (humming studio, coffee particles) and eerie atmosphere synergize with the surreal setting, though the dying god's role feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (apathy as catalyst) and imagery (coffee forming reef maps) are effective, but emotional impact is diluted by the protagonist's emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s by linking apathy and creation; metaphors (grinder as reef-mending tool) feel fresh. Minimal "purple prose," but some overly ornate phrasing distracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a complete arc, but the story leans on its concept more than emotional or thematic depth, leaving a faintly schematic impression.</comment>
