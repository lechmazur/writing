<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; actions feel plot-directed rather than psychologically grounded. Motivation is clear but inadequately explored, with insufficient personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Predictable structure with a resolution that feels rushed. Plot coherence suffers from underdeveloped cause-effect logic (e.g., how snowflakes disrupt the Core).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details about the icy landscape and orchard create a haunting atmosphere, though world-building gaps (e.g., Core mechanics) weaken immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (veil/snowflakes) and subtext about emotion vs. logic but fails to deepen themes through character or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on overused science-fiction tropes (dormant AI, fractal patterns). Prose frequently veers into pretentiousness without meaningful innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are technically cohesive but lack transformative depth; the narrative fulfills requirements without achieving exceptional thematic or emotional resonance.</comment>
