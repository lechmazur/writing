<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are distinct and thematically aligned, but motivations lack gradual emotional evolution, rendering change slightly abrupt despite effective voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circle-of-responsibility structure is satisfying, but the rapid pivot from isolation to openness strains credibility within the word limit. Pacing is mostly balanced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting functions as both haunted mirror and character, using precise sensory details (condensation, rusted hinges) to create atmosphere that directly nourishes thematic marrow.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphor webs (atomization vs listening) and controlled subtext elevate the piece beyond mere ghost-hunting allegory into profound meditation on emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre stasis through symbolic lens use and linguistic precision, though some adjectival choices flirt with excess. No AI fingerprints in characterization or emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically with theme despite constraints; the compact length works to heighten emotional resonance through strategic omissions rather than feeling artificially truncated.</comment>
