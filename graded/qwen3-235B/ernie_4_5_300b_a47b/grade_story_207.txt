<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arc is clear but emotional nuance lacks depth; traits like 'meekly assertive' are superficially demonstrated through action but not internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent arc under time constraints, but the connection between gossip columns and the ritual feels underdeveloped; pacing is uneven in middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid, cohesive sensory details (fractured vents, cosmic static), though setting’s thematic alignment with 'joyful loneliness' is inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphorical resonance (petals as guilt, scanner as reckoning) and lyrical prose elevate thematic depth; ending’s introspective poignancy stands out.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid imagery and subversion of redemption tropes (quiet introspection over grand gestures) avoid cliché; occasional vagueness in 'gossip columns' weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively to explore redemption; brevity emphasizes thematic focus, though the method’s logic leaves minor gaps in narrative plausibility.</comment>
