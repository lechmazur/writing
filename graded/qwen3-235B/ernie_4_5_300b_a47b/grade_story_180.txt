<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths in showing Remy’s guilt through tactile interactions and visions, but emotional depth remains surface-level; motivations connect to actions but lack complexity in psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective pacing and circular structure (yard sale cycle) create cohesion, but resolution feels abrupt and underexplored despite strong thematic connections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Shipwrecks and greenhouse create evocative atmosphere; sensory details (rot, iron tang) immerse readers, but shipwrecks’ symbolism remains underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "wild frontier" and the knitting needle’s symbolism are potent, but thematic execution leans on abstract phrases rather than concrete imagery for emotional weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but includes tropish phrases ("wild frontier of mind"); metaphors are occasionally overwrought. Emotional resonance exists but isn’t consistently shown through actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like the greenhouse and knitting needle are cohesive, but the yard sales and shipwrecks feel secondary rather than integral. Style leans into lyricism without fully resolving thematic ambiguity.</comment>
