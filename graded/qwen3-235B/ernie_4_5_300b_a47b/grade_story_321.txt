<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are implied but lack psychological depth; reactions align with motivation but emotional complexity feels surface-level. The existential weight of displacement isn't fully embodied in her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through symbolic object-driven action; the transition into the magical resolution strains cause/effect logic but serves thematic momentum. The confined arc works within constraints despite some narrative compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Viscerally immersive setting through sulfuric flames, obsidian textures, and burnt regret smells. Atmosphere perfectly mirrors moral/spiritual decay but could expand infernal logic governing forgiveness mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors sing with visceral weight (sins as ash, cosmic silence as antagonist). Ending resonates thematically despite dialogue's occasional didacticism. The hourglass's stigmata imagery elevates literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original metaphorical framework avoids genre tropes; some phrasing ("storm of black and gold") risks over-decoration. Emotional logic revealed through action rather than exposition, maintaining stylistic consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements fuse organically except for the tenuously framed timeframe. The bridge metaphor and sacrificial ribbon demonstrate inventive synthesis. The narrative's spiritual economy feels fully realized within its self-contained logic.</comment>
