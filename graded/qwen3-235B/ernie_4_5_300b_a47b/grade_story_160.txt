<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Poor character differentiation; secondary figure exists solely as exposition vessel. Protagonist's actions lack psychological depth despite assigned motivation. Dialogue feels stilted and unmotivated by established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable "mysterious stranger" template. Revelation structure feels contrived. Transformation resolved too easily, undermining threat of prior tension. Framing device clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually rich, thematically coherent atmosphere. Sensory details effectively merge industrial decay with cosmic wonder. Setting inconsistencies exist (abandonment vs. active waiting), but worldbuilding generally compelling in concept and execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery (flickering lanterns becoming constellations) balanced by overwritten metaphors. Attempts thematic depth with cyclical time but fails to interrogate implications. Dialogue too overt; shows rather than embodies "prickly wonder".</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Occasional inventive combinations (braille maps on briefcases) undermined by recycled mystical artifact tropes. Purple prose in early paragraphs ("applause echoing like distant thunder"). Emotional beats too often stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive within constraints, but elements function more as decoration than structural pillars. Brevity works against thematic exploration. Lingering impact emerges from conceptual questions rather than narrative execution.</comment>
