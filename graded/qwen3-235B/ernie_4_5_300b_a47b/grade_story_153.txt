<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but underdeveloped. Elias' immortality studies and 'gifted burden' are stated rather than dramatized, while interactions with Zara lack emotional texture. His mechanical dialogue undermines the tone of "detached devotion."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Starts compellingly but falters. The digitization action drives the plot but lacks concrete process details; the abrupt end feels schematic rather than earned. Pacing rushes through weeks of labor while key cause-effect relationships (data upload triggering collapse) remain unexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambiently immersive but conceptually inconsistent. Visceral details (flickering headlamplight, glowing fungi) contrast with vague environmental logic. The mole people's collective memory belief gets undercut by their static presence as faceless whisperers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Offers speculative heft with conceptual scaffolding. The archive-as-mirror metaphor works thematically but requires deeper excavation. The tone sustains philosophical melancholy, though emotional beats rely too heavily on stated oppositions ("preserving" vs "erasing").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but contains AI-writerly markers. Sensory details like "humming generators" feel underutilized. The central conflict follows recognizable tech-dystopia patterns without fully subverting expectations about digital preservation's consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Successfully synthesizes speculative elements into a coherent thematic framework despite some narrative thinness. The headlamp and journal-swapping mechanics create intriguing tension between analog/digital, but secondary character development remains skeletal despite the brevity constraint.</comment>
