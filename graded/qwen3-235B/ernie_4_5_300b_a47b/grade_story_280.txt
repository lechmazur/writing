<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to master strategy via animal tracks isn’t fully grounded in her hermit beekeeper identity; reactions to elements like the quasar flare feel abstract rather than emotionally specific.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative arc (preparing, enduring flare, concluding) is coherent, but pacing leans too heavily on ethereal descriptions, dampening plot momentum in the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush, sensory-rich fusion of cosmic and tactile elements (brass, stardust, snow) creates a unique atmosphere, though the quasar deck’s logic as a beekeeper’s refuge remains unconvincing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (honeycomb/galaxy, animal tracks/strategy) and symbolic layering (mixed blessings) resonate intellectually; ending feels thematically resolved without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some phrases (“whispers of the void,” “sweetly confrontational”) veer into pretension; the tone occasionally prioritizes ornate language over organic nuance, suggesting artificial flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements like the brass cups and animal tracks add cohesion, but the story’s ambition occasionally overwhelms its brevity, leaving themes under-embodied despite poetic polish.</comment>
