<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness is implicit but not deeply explored; his internal conflict drives the narrative, but motivations lack nuanced emotional grounding in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent and thematically resolved, but pacing feels compressed; the transition from skepticism to acceptance is underdeveloped despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral gallery and snow days create a vivid, immersive atmosphere; sensory details (e.g., melting snow, flickering candle) enhance mood more than they advance plot or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery ("shadows dance like ghosts") and theme ("solace in release") elevate the story, but ending leans on clich√©; emotional resonance is undercut by overgeneralized metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical prose balances against overly ornate phrasing ("demure audacity"); some emotional nuance is implied, but internal logic occasionally feels mechanical (e.g., sudden shift from scoffing to compliance).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story coherently integrates assigned elements but leans on familiar archetypes (storm as metaphor for transformation); thematic ambition exceeds execution in brevity.</comment>
