<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pedestrian motivation; solitude as mere affectation rather than psychological necessity. Dialogue lacks distinct voice; actions align with traits but lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed. Board game structure forces artificial pacing; stakes remain abstract despite the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical descriptions overwhelm coherence - "shadows froze" contradicts physical plausibility. Atmosphere amplifies theme but overwhelms internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "blade wrapped in silk" are overwritten yet hollow. The ending's revelation feels performative rather than earned; theme stated overtly instead of embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on elemental fantasy tropes with superficial "philosophical" dressing. Mechanical use of contrast between ice and growth; emotional beats telegraphed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fits assignment parameters but lacks transcendent urgency. The elements assemble competently rather than cohesively; concept-driven rather than story-generated.</comment>
