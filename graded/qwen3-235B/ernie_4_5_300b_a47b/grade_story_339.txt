<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character development is present but occasionally superficial; the performer's guilt drives the narrative, but deeper exploration of his identity as a "joyless performer" beyond surface-level descriptions would enhance internal conflict and agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive within constraints, with clear progression from guilt to release; reliance on abstract metaphor (e.g., seesaw) occasionally muddles immediacy of action, but the lake and drawer-knob motifs provide narrative throughlines.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere and sensory detail are vividly rendered, particularly the lake’s prismatic hues and construction backdrop; these elements effectively mirror emotional turmoil, though the resort’s symbolic role remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Storytelling employs strong metaphors (e.g., drawer-knob as guilt) and lyrical prose; emotional resonance is effective but occasionally undercut by passive resolutions (e.g., guilt becoming a "feather") that lean on familiar tropes rather than earned nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality is tempered by familiar metaphors (seesaw, lake as mirror) and slightly overwrought phrasing ("modestly extravagant"); character voice avoids cliché, but atmospheric elements occasionally veer into generic lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements with thematic intent; some choices (e.g., "cautious abandon") feel underdeveloped, but the narrative’s brevity works to its advantage, leaving room for reflection without feeling constrained.</comment>
