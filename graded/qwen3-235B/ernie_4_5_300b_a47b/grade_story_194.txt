<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths in Finn's determination and unique voice, but shallow exploration of his lumberjack spirit and motivation's depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently but feels rushed; bike rides and the restaurant confrontation anchor the arc, yet transitions lack nuance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (e.g., bone marrow as exploitation), sharp dialogue, and unresolved tension elevate thematic resonance and emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in merging the ossuary’s horror with gourmet culture, but generic descriptors (e.g., "porcelain-cracking" dialogue) and tropes slightly undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, but the lumberjack identity and healing traditions feel underutilized, hinting at surface-level integration.</comment>
