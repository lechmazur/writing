<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; his "awkward charm" feels tacked on rather than integral. Internal motivations are stated more than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic arc but feels rushed; lunar tracking and transformation are referenced but lack mechanical explanation. Cause-effect logic exists but is superficially realized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels visually—the fortress’s shifting light and storm create tension—but overreliance on clichéd "ancient evil" trappings undermines originality. Sensory details occasionally verge on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery (mirror’s lies, orchid’s glow) elevates the surface, but thematic depth is uneven. Emotional resonance exists in concept more than execution; ending feels narratively tidy yet emotionally flat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some fresh concepts (lunar-activated fortress) are diluted by tropes like ghostly family curses. Repetitive descriptors ("translucent," "shimmered") and mechanical phrasing (e.g., “nostalgic defiance sharpening his tone”) lean formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story coheres structurally but prioritizes spectacle over emotional grounding. Assigned elements are present but unevenly integrated; themes of truth and legacy have potential but feel underexplored.</comment>
