<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations are emotionally static, relying on surface trauma tropes rather than nuanced evolution; the smuggler’s irate nature feels performative rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plotted with lyrical momentum, but the sudden shift between tea-leaf prophecy and bioluminescent revelation lacks narrative tension; emotional payoff diluted by overly symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vividly textured with metallic decay and fungal glow; atmosphere occasionally overwhelms story purpose, becoming a stylistic flourish rather than integral to character or theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite literary craftsmanship—metaphors cut like glass, the fern’s "slow unfurling" mirrors quiet transformation; ending resonates with paradoxical hope amid decay.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elevated by fresh imagery (heart as a muscle, waterfalls of fungi), but risks overwritten melancholy; emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown through situation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Weaves assigned elements into cohesive existential meditation; structure’s brevity enhances thematic compression, though some threads (spaceport’s significance) remain under-illuminated.</comment>
