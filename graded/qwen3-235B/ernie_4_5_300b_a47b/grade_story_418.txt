<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is palpable, but motivations feel somewhat abstract (re: universalizing "courage to confess" rather than personal specificity) and dialogue lacks distinct voice beyond fragmented statements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has symbolic progression but feels compressed; the climactic transformation of the orchard lacks narrative weight due to limited build-up, though the glitter motif consistently threads through actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually striking, cohesively rendered worldâ€”decaying yet defiantly vibrant. The radioactive orchard's tinfoil rustle and jaundice sky complement the character's struggle. Strong sensory integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through metaphoric glitter and color-as-resistance theme. Symbolism occasionally weighs on heavy-handedness but the quiet "melody of reckless hope" lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong imagery subverts post-apocalyptic tropes, though some phrasing ("merry bitterness," "laugh like wind chimes") risks preciousness. Glitter-as-defiance remains original, with emotional beats shown rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration ranges from masterful (costume/glitter) to underdeveloped (timeframe's record player significance). Cohesion exists within thematic framework but lacks narrative punch.</comment>
