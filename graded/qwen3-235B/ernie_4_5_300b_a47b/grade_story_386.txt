<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Characters have distinct traits (e.g., Lirael's frayed memories, Kael's silent support), but their histories and inner conflicts remain underexplored; motivations are implied rather than deeply dramatized, though the emotional resonance between them feels genuine.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Simple structure (preparation, execution, resolution) works within constraints, but the emotional climax feels rushed. The connection between the catapult's activation and the healing is logical but lacks visceral impact due to limited psychological buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere (atom-lighthouse's heartbeat hum, blue moss, "borrowed dawn") creates a haunting, timeless setting. The quantum mist and prismatic light align with the story's themes, though some descriptions verge on over-decorative without deepening narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., grief as a catapult, wounds "knit" by willpower) elevate the narrative. The ending's emotional payoff—shared stillness amid cosmic spectacle—lingers, though the story leans on abstract concepts (defiance, memory) more than visceral detail.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original use of the tablecloth and atom-lighthouse avoids formulaic sci-fi/fantasy tropes. Some phrases ("quietly defiant spirit," "weight of silence") risk overwrought abstraction, but the fusion of science and myth (resonance as technology/magic) feels fresh and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven for a short text: the tablecloth, stars, and lighthouse drive both plot and theme. While the brevity creates elegance, the story’s ambition (time trauma, interstellar memory) demands more room to fully resonate emotionally.</comment>
