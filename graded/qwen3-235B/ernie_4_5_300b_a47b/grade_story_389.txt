<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characterization relies on surface traits; motivation is present but lacks psychological depth or nuance beyond archetype. Physical details don't meaningfully influence actions or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot contains a functional arc but feels compressed; cause-effect between artifact and downfall is clear but execution lacks tension. Pacing sacrifices emotional weight for exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through setting details, but object/setting integration feels decorative rather than visceral. Sensory elements hint at potential but underdeliver immersive cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Surface thematic resonance about power and sacrifice exists but lacks emotional complexity or memorable craftsmanship. Subtext remains superficial, with overused metaphors diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through grim tone but employs familiar arcs without sufficient innovation. Some purple prose detracts (e.g., "fruit of knowledge"), with emotional stakes primarily stated rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved but elements serve plot mechanics rather than thematic synergy. Brief length exposes structural shortcuts rather than leveraging constraints for artistic effect.</comment>
