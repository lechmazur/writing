<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alaric's traits partially inform his actions but lack psychological depth; motivations are clear yet motivations rely heavily on exposition over organic characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing uneven; abrupt shifts in magical activation and guild hall collapse undercut tension; cause/effect between elements (shell, candlestick) sometimes logically convoluted within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually atmospheric with soot/chimney motifs, but sensory details lean repetitive (light/shadow overuse); setting's physicality could better mirror character's tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dramatic stakes present but emotional impact diluted by declarative dialogue (e.g., "You fear innovation"); symbolism (shell as legacy bridge) works but feels explained rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on "ancient artifact awakens" framework; some effective imagery (dancing shadows, humming gears), but exposition-heavy character descriptions hinder authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements cohere technically but lack conceptual daring; the fusion of mechanical magic and legacy motifs hints at deeper themes but execution remains surface-level polished genre fiction.</comment>
