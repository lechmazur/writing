<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated rather than demonstrated, and the transition from cook to seismic truth-seeker feels arbitrary and unearned. Personality traits serve plot contrivance rather than organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on expository revelations with minimal buildup; cause-effect logic collapses under scrutiny. The compressed structure fails to establish narrative logic, leaving the resolution unearned and disjointed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Rich imagery of dust and architecture lacks functional integration with the central mystery. Sensory details are decoratively deployed rather than revealing character psychology or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic juxtapositions (science as illusion, truth in forgotten objects) are undermined by simplistic execution. The ending gestures at philosophical weight without earning emotional or intellectual payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Overreliance on archetypal "mad genius" tropes and melodramatic confrontations. Conceptual inversion of earthquake science lacks imaginative specifics, while tonal shifts feel mechanically imposed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion is compromised by the sheer density of underdeveloped elements. The tight word limit exacerbates structural fragility, with critical details feeling hastily pasted rather than organically grown.</comment>
