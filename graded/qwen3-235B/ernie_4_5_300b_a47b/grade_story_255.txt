<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but inconsistently nuanced. The "innocent cynicism" feels surface-level; internal conflicts between skepticism and hope are stated more than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tightly constructed short-form plot with a clear arc, but the resolution feels slightly rushed. The scent-based decryption mechanism is clever but requires significant suspension of disbelief that slightly fractures narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric density for a short piece. The abandoned tower's sensory details (rust, petrichor, fading party warmth) create haunting contrast between myth and decay that permeates the entire narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance with the battery as justice/artifact, but emotional impact is undercut by overly ornate phrasing that occasionally distracts from core themes. Subtext is effective when subtle (names on walls) but didactic when stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (scent-as-cipher) and slightly formulaic "seer seeking relic" tropes. Some metaphors strain for profundity ("tasting like old pennies") but atmospheric originality prevents full descent into cliche.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Integrates elements with deliberate purpose but leaves certain thematic threads underdeveloped. The ending's thematic weight feels earned despite formal constraints, suggesting thoughtful editorial shaping rather than algorithmic generation.</comment>
