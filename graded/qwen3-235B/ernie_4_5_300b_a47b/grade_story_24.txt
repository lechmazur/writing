<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bard’s motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the warmth-seeking action lacks psychological depth. The puppet show climax reveals character purpose but doesn’t fundamentally transform him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect chain (dentures → warmth → thawing reactions); the apologetic text resolves personal stakes. Pacing is tight but slightly rushed in artifact acquisition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich, original sensory details (glowing moss, clock ticking backward) create an immersive, dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly complements the fractured idyll tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (e.g., "radiating warmth" as emotional catalyst) and thematic coherence between cold hearts and subversive artistry. Subtext about art’s transformative power resonates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but occasionally leans on overly ornate phrasing ("liquid starlight"). The puppet show concept feels fresh but slightly contrived in execution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story thrives within constraints; however, the mountain setting feels underexploited thematically compared to the emotional payoff in the bar scene.</comment>
