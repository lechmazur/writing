<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (naivety as a strength) is clear but lacks deeper psychological conflict; dialogue reveals key traits but doesn't fully explore internal contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tightly paced plot with logical cause-effect (humming activates shard), but the commercial timeframe device feels underutilized beyond its symbolic value.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective sensory contrasts (ancient runes vs. holograms) and tactile details (shard's "exist-in-both-hands" quality), but the vaultâ€™s energy isn't fully explained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subtle emotional resonance through action ("hand rests gently"), fresh metaphors (rumors as soil), and thematic cohesion around naivety vs. institutionalized knowledge.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with the virtual/mystical blend, but "whispers of relics" and hologram static risk slight predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically (shard's role, rumor motif), though some (midnight gatherings) feel utilitarian rather than organic; leaves questions about faith in systems.</comment>
