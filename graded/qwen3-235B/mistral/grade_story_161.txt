<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Edgar’s motivation (finding Henry) is consistent but could use more emotional nuance; his “sardonic glee” feels underexplored in dialogue/actions, relying too heavily on surface traits rather than layered human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from discovery to resolution, but the 500-word constraint strains the conspiracy reveal; cause-effect linking the seal to the hidden compartment lacks detailed buildup, making the ending feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting has intriguing hooks (orchard vs. paper airplane facility) but lacks sensory cohesion; the peacock emblem’s omnipresence could be amplified with environmental details to heighten eerie atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (peacock tails as maps, airplanes as grief) elevates the narrative; the ending ties into the theme of closure, but emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by overly expository prose (“silent scream into the void”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (e.g., the “eccentric” facilitators risk caricature but are spared by Edgar’s perspective); some phrases (“breadcrumbs,” “storm inside him”) lean generic, and the “hidden compartment” resolution veers predictably.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but without groundbreaking ingenuity; the story’s brevity sharpens its focus on metaphor but sacrifices deeper exploration of the conspiracy’s stakes; lingers more in concept than emotional impact.</comment>
