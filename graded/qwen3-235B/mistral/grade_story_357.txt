<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Edmund's focus and obsession with the game are central, but his character remains flat with motivations stated more than demonstrated; interactions with the giant lack nuanced development. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A clear arc exists (isolation to connection), but the pivotal party scene feels rushed; the concept of despair drives the resolution but lacks gradual buildup. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting evokes cold isolation effectively through sparse sensory details (misty breath, ice pillars), but deeper immersion via contrasting warmth of the party or tactile game details is missing. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of solitude and shared strength resonate, but relies on overt statements ("maybe we can triumph together") rather than subtext; symbolism of the black rose and game as despair is underexplored. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Employing a lonely giant and despair-as-predator leans on familiar tropes without subversion; metaphors are literal rather than evocative, and the party scene's abrupt whimsy feels formulaic. </comment>
