<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks nuance; necromancy powers are underutilized, motivations are surface-level. The baseball cap's symbolism is vague and not deeply tied to the protagonist's identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot exists but lacks momentum; repetitive descriptions replace conflict. The resolution feels abrupt and disconnected from earlier tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in crystalline cave, but futuristic nostalgia is inconsistently applied. Some elements (e.g., necromancy) don't align with the established tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective imagery and symbolism (baseball cap, glowing crystals), but shallow emotional resonance. Theme of preserving history is clear but underdeveloped beyond surface-level nostalgia.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar tropes (exploring mysterious caves). Writing style is readable but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing without deeper purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates most elements, but the necromancer concept feels superficial. Some arbitrary details (e.g., "between sets") lack narrative weight, weakening overall impact.</comment>
