<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Empath trait is central but underdeveloped motivation; introversion inconsistently demonstrated. Character’s connection to marionette lacks nuanced psychological layers. Voice feels generic in third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Simple arc exists but pacing feels rushed. Cause/effect is logical (empathy → reassembly), yet resolution lacks emotional weight. The constrained word limit strains narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</comment><question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting’s bioluminescent flora and asteroid hideout evoke vivid atmosphere, but tone clashes (‘drowsy enthusiasm’ feels artificial). Sensory details are evocative but unevenly integrated with character’s interiority.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (marionette) is clear but shallow. Writing leans on metaphor without subtext; emotional impact is surface-level. Theme of healing is consistent but lacks complexity or lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes (empathic outsider, broken object as metaphor). Purple prose mars clarity; stated emotions dominate. Metaphors (mountain wisdom) feel generic. AI-like repetition in descriptions (“drowsy enthusiasm” recurs without purpose).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but elements feel imposed rather than organic. The brief length exacerbates rushed pacing. Conceptual framework (reassembling marionette) is clever but lacks depth beyond surface narrative.</comment>
