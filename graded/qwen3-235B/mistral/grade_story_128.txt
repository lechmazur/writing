<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits like "fretful" and "hesitantly bold" exist but lack depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions. Psychological shifts feel abrupt and under-justified.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pacing stumbles between rushed transitions (discovery of TVs) and over-explained moments. The central action (seeing unfiltered world) drives plot but the televisions' "jumbled subtitles" section feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually evocative with amber lighting and flickering screens, but the collision of ancient Egypt with modern technology creates tonal dissonance that undermines atmosphere. Sensory details focus on visuals at the expense of other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphor of fading photograph works superficially but lacks subtext about impermanence. Ending attempts emotional resonance but feels preordained rather than earned, with themes stated explicitly rather than revealed through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in mixing ancient/present is strong, but execution veers into AI-generated patterns - overused metaphors ("heart pounded like drum"), emotionally simplified character arcs, and occasionally stilted transitions between registers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements serve plot mechanics but rarely deepen thematic coherence. While brevity is effective, the story lacks haunting ambiguity - emotional impact feels more mechanical than resonant, with most concepts introduced but not fully interrogated.</comment>
