<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Edmund's ghost-whispering trait lacks concrete integration into his actions or conflict; motivations are stated but psychologically underdeveloped; reactions to amber are metaphorical but insufficiently tethered to functional character behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on static symbolism rather than organic causality; amber discovery catalyzes change too abruptly; narrative arc exists but resolution feels mechanically imposed rather than earned through character-driven tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting details evoke tactile atmosphere through precise decay imagery; time-worn carnival elements viscerally mirror emotional stasis; sensory integration of amber's chill as thematic throughline lacks sufficient textural counterpoint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Melancholic liberation theme employs resonant metaphors (amber insect, frozen heart) but emotional impact diluted by persistent abstraction; narrative voice remains consistent but lacks linguistic distinctiveness; ending's catharsis feels predetermined rather than organically experienced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on melancholy-liberation binary without subverting clich√©; amber symbolism is fresh but insufficiently contextualized within larger metaphysics; sensory descriptions occasionally verge on purple prose while ghost elements remain mysteriously underutilized despite narrative potential.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through persistent mood but elements function additively rather than synergetically; formal constraints shape narrative but lack stylistic boldness; thematic resonance present yet shallow; brevity works but doesn't transcend structural limitations.</comment>
