<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's phobias are stated but not deeply integrated into actions or decisions; stunt double profession serves little narrative purpose; motivation to confront fears lacks psychological nuance despite thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows predictable arc of personal growth but lacks meaningful stakes; progression from knot-tying to transformation feels rushed and underdeveloped; resolution resolves too neatly without earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Setting relies on clich√©d exoticism ("pyramid," "forgotten library") without immersive sensory details; atmosphere of "numb fascination" created through repetitive auditory motifs rather than original imagery or emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Themes of self-discovery are communicated through generic metaphors; subtext equating knot-untying with emotional healing lacks complexity; ending feels artificially redemptive rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Repetitive phrase structures ("echoes in the dark," "dance on the edge of madness") suggest formulaic writing; relies on overused tropes (haunted protagonist confronting fears in ancient ruins) without subversion; metaphors feel derivative rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements appear forcibly assembled rather than organically integrated; brief length exacerbates disjointedness between concepts; resolution offers closure but lacks narrative ambition or lasting resonance beyond surface-level metaphor.</comment>
