<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weak character interiority; motivation stated rather than revealed through specific emotional beats. Personality traits remain abstract despite narrative proximity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows expected trajectory without complexity; arc compressed but functional. Pacing uneven in middle sections dilutes momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through conceptual fusion (thermometer + fortune-teller). Prose occasionally lapses into ornamental description rather than functional imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack surprising synergies. Premise is intriguing, but brevity prevents full thematic flowering.</comment>
