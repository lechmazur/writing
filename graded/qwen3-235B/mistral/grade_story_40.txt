<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Edmund’s motivation to atone for perceived familial guilt shapes his actions, but the reincarnated goldfish premise strains plausibility, diluting psychological depth. His reactions to the soldier reveal self-awareness but lack visceral emotional complexity beyond whimsy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Storm and soldier’s discovery drive the plot, but the arc’s resolution feels abrupt. The 500-word constraint compresses causality, particularly the epiphany about his uncle’s disappearance. Pacing leans static despite symbolic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recipe library’s tactile decadence—dust, yellowed pages, storm-light contrasts—immerses readers, tying atmosphere to themes of stagnation and revelation. Setting and tone harmonize, elevating the story’s introspective mood into something haunting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (golden light, soldier’s missing arm) and the fish-as-uncle device evoke layered reflection on guilt. The ending’s serenity feels earned, though emotional impact is tempered by overly tidy symbolism and underexplored subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clichés but occasionally veers into quirkiness for its own sake. Sensory details (rain, dust) are vivid, yet the goldfish’s reincarnation and doctor’s chart nod to archetypal melancholy without fully transcending it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story coheres around guilt, but the brief length sacrifices nuance. Elements like the storm feel artificially imposed rather than organically integrated. Lingering resonance stems from atmosphere over narrative ingenuity.</comment>
