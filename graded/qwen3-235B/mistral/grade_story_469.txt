<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by overreaching aligns with action concept, but pacing is uneven within the word limit; cause-effect is logical but the climax feels rushed; resolution is mostly coherent but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively described (scent, cathedral details) but fails to fully immerse; setting elements like the whispering gallery are underutilized; sensory details are present but inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of forgotten histories resonate, but emotional resonance is undercut by surface-level exploration; symbols like the skeleton key are effective but underdeveloped; writing style leans toward poetic abstraction over visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (e.g., "grandiose modesty") but relies on tropes (smuggler archetype, forbidden tunnels); sensory details occasionally verge on clich√©; tone shifts feel abrupt rather than nuanced, hinting at formulaic transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements are present but unevenly integrated; the story leans on their symbolic weight rather than organic use; brevity hinders depth but allows focus on core themes; lacks lingering impact or surprise.</comment>
