<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weaker internal logic between vendetta and character behavior; motivation pivots from revenge to abstract hope without emotional transition. Skills surface-level tied to plot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on underdeveloped connections (locket's sudden importance); resolution simplifies collective action into easy triumph. Time compression feels artificial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory specificity in market setting creates vivid decay, but fails to integrate olfactory elements from candy-making. Atmosphere enhances theme but lacks physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (sugar defying repression) effective but unsubtle. Subtext about memorialization through art promising but underdeveloped. Ending strains plausibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mix of fresh (sugar as revolutionary medium) and conventional (rebellion arc). Avoids many tropes but stumbles into "people power" clich√© in climax. Prose uneven between lyrical and purple.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements function but lack narrative inevitability. Short length exposes structural gaps in character logic and temporal scope. Memorable imagery doesn't compensate for thematic imprecision.</comment>
