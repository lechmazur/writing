<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Attribute "deeply superficial" lacks clear manifestation; motivation to discover truth contradicts superficiality. Character voice remains indistinct despite introspective elements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression but relies on overly convenient discoveries. The shell's function as key lacks sufficient buildup. Pacing uneven in word-limited arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create immersive, mythic atmosphere. The floating library's liminal space between reality/myth evocatively rendered through tactile descriptions of books as living entities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (books as wings) and symbolic elements present, but emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition. Theme of perpetual discovery resonates but lacks visceral weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic patterns but contains slight overuse of archetypal "ancient library" tropes. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate description but maintains stylistic consistency throughout.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially rather than organically. The brief form works but feels artificially constrained rather than purposeful. Conceptual depth present but execution uneven.</comment>
