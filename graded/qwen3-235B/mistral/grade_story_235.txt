<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters remain enigmatic; motivations lack depth despite poetic allusions. Yumi's obsession with celestial patterns lacks grounding in relatable human emotion, Hiroshi's fascination borders on implausibility given limited interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but feels compressed. The shift from observation to romantic connection lacks sufficient emotional build. Meteor shower symbolism provides tenuous structural cohesion rather than organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery of castle and imperial gardens creates visual splendor, but sensory immersion remains surface-level. The ephemeral vs. preserved flower dichotomy cleverly mirrors celestial-terrestrial themes, though atmospheric potential is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors possess elegance (e.g., "distilled intimacy"), but emotional impact is diffused. Themes of fate and communication are present but lack narrative tension. The ending satisfies aesthetically but fails to resonate beyond surface romanticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Voids formulaic writing through celestial-floral coding system and understated approach. However, the "silent love" trope and melancholic atmosphere occasionally border on poetic convention rather than transcendent originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Elements coexist harmoniously yet fail to achieve narrative transcendence. Brevisity serves thematic purposes but limits emotional stakes. Metaphysical concepts remain more suggestive than profound, leaving conceptual richness underexplored.</comment>
