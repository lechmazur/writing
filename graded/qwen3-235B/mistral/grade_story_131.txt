<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; Eli's transformation from aloof orphan to courageous participant occurs too quickly without sufficient emotional scaffolding or nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Basic three-act structure exists within constraints, but pacing feels rushed despite clear thematic arc. The lottery ticket's role as a catalyst lacks organic integration with the gravitational anomaly's established rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative fragments (whispers-thin river, grimy sanctuary) but the gravitational anomaly remains superficially rendered, failing to create immersive psychological discomfort or environmental coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stones as courage metaphors show promise, but thematic resonance diluted by frequent abstractions ("felt a profound shift") rather than embodied, sensory transformation. Ending resolves too neatly for stated lofty ambitions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original premise elements undermined by clich√©d orphan-hero tropes and formulaic courage arc. Avoids excessive purple prose but contains generic phrasing ("turbulent sea of foster care") rather than fresh, character-specific imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Required elements present but unevenly weighted - stones and adaptation concept work best. Tight word limit highlights structural awkwardness rather than feeling purposefully distilled. Lingering impression is concept over execution.</comment>
