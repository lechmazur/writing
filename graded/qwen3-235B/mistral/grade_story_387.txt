<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation as a selfless musician mapping migration through song is clear, but her internal complexities and emotional evolution remain underexplored, making her feel more symbolic than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot adheres to a simple arc (detecting the melody, locating the colony) but feels rushed in its resolution, with the shift from longing to hope underserved by underdeveloped interactions with the colonists.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and wind chimes evoke a tactile, nostalgic atmosphere, but the "centuries of longing" timeframe is mentioned rather than felt, weakening its emotional integration.</comment>
