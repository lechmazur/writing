<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks nuanced development beyond the "tortured protector" trope; emotional stakes are felt but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is mostly controlled, but the planetarium catalyst feels tacked on; the plot’s arc is coherent yet relies on predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie, immersive atmosphere with vivid sensory details; the setting mirrors Eamon’s psychological state but occasionally veers into overdescriptive stagnation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (doll, letter) and a resonant theme, but emotional payoff leans on familiar tropes; stronger in mood than in subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks originality in its reliance on gothic decay, tragic love, and "letter from beyond" motifs; writing is polished but rarely surprises or subverts expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and competently structured, but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration for emotional shorthand; feels like a well-crafted archetype rather than a definitive literary work.</comment>
