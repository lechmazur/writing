<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motives are clear but lack depth; Eli's grief feels one-dimensional despite attempts to explore complexity through symbolic objects and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has a loose arc but suffers from diffuse pacing; emotional resolution feels abrupt despite thematic symmetry between silence and music.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but underutilized; the echo chamber's unique properties could have more directly mirrored Eli's psychological state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (collar as constellation, silence as void) but relies heavily on abstract telling rather than visceral showing; thematic coherence outweighs uneven execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Strains under clich√©d emotional beats (lost love, cosmic metaphors) and overly polished phrasing that feels self-consciously poetic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Holds together thematically but lacks the narrative urgency or stylistic daring needed to elevate it above competent middle-tier literary fiction.</comment>
