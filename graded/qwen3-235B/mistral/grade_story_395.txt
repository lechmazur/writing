<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Everett's dual traits of duty and rebellion inform his actions, but internal conflicts are superficial. Selene's motivations remain opaque, and their dynamic lacks depth beyond shared interest in manuscripts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot adheres to heist structure but feels compressed. The alliance forms hastily, and stakes lack urgency due to minimal tension. Resolution feels abrupt, with cause-effect gaps in infiltration logistics.</comment>
