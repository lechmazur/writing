<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Main character's motivation toward immortality lacks psychological depth; traits like "detached devotion" are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions; "gifted burdens" reference feels superficially attached to the headlamp object</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Progression from discovery to digitization to "mastery of reality" lacks organic momentum; time compression obfuscates cause-effect logic between journal patterns and enlightenment; digitization method remains vaguely technical; abrupt transition to legendary status weakens narrative payoff</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-stellar underground city establishes unique atmosphere but worldbuilding feels perfunctory; mole people's societal context and relationship to Eli's work remain underexplored; coal miner's headlamp illumination creates effective visual contrast but sensory details about subterranean environment (humidity, mineral smells, etc.) missing</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conceptual theme of immortality through information preservation offers intellectual resonance but executes predictably; ending's "moved on to next quest" feels narratively empty; symbolism of headlamp and journals lacks layered subtext; writing style prioritizes exposition over immersive "showing"</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Contains AI-writing telltales: formulaic adjectives ("labyrinthine," "yellowed"), overused "eternal" repetition, sudden temporal jumps ("after what felt like an eternity"); "mundanely glorious" concept inconsistently applies; emotional states tend toward explicit labeling rather than dramatization; avoids major clich√©s but lacks groundbreaking subversions</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements minimally intertwined: mole people's culture and post-stellar timeframe barely influence plot mechanics; "gifted burdens" and "detached devotion" remain abstract concepts; headlamp's functional role in digitization could apply to any light source; thematically coherent but technically utilitarian integration</comment>
