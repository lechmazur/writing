<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations connect to actions but lack psychological depth; emotional shift from ambivalence to hope feels abrupt despite memory trigger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coheres but relies heavily on internal realization rather than external action; narrative arc compressed yet complete. Pacing drags slightly in meal-preparation section.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive; sensory details (frost, silence, light refraction) masterfully enhance tone. Setting directly informs character's isolation and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor (ice/warmth dichotomy); subtle showing of transformation via sensory details rather than overt statement. Subtext about memory-as-connection effectively conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic elements through specific, unexpected details (frost-kissed orchard over crevasse, glistening fruits). Emotional nuances shown through physical objects and rituals rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple assigned elements; all serve theme of connection versus isolation. Ending achieves satisfactory resolution while leaving room for implied future action. Lingers on hopeful transformation.</comment>
