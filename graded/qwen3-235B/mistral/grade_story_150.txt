<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's outlaw poet identity lacks nuance; motivation declared but underdemonstrated. Ambivalence feels superficially stated rather than embodied through complex decisions. Distinct voice compromised by over-reliance on genre tropes ("cowboy poet" cliché).
</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows disaster-averting arc efficiently but relies on contrived resolution. Causality between dice readings and collective action lacks plausible mechanism. Pacing prioritizes expediency over emotional investment in interconnected fates.  
</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Steampunk setting established through competent but derivative sensory details (brass gears, gaslight). Atmosphere unevenly textured—coffee shop's mutable text juxtaposes oddly with observatory's grandeur without deeper thematic interplay.

<comment>Imagery (destinies as dice runes) evocative but surface-level. Theme of fate interconnection introduced through exposition rather than dramatic tension. Ending resolves immediate conflict but sidesteps philosophical ramifications of altering shared destinies.  
</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Routine anthropomorphism of dice prophecies veers toward cliché. Coffee shop divination mechanism (shifting text) novel yet contextually unearned. Prose occasionally succumbs to ornamental excess (e.g., "voice a low rumble like distant thunder"). Ambivalence feels imposed rather than organic.  
</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding elements present but unevenly integrated. Tight constraints lead to expedient resolutions undermining tension. Conceptual ambition evident in fatalism vs. agency conflict but underexplored. Lingering question about ethics of unilateral destiny alteration remains unaddressed.
