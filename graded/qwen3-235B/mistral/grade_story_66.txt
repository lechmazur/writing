<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but some assigned attributes (like 'quiet') are underexplored. The mirror and mask effectively reveal backstory but Eli's inner voice lacks distinctiveness, relying on poetic descriptions over nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with clear arc but pacing feels compressed. The connection between puzzles, plant research, and mask destruction is logical but underdeveloped. Jigsaw motif could better integrate with the resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses evocative nature imagery but plant communication remains a background element. Sensory details (whispering leaves, fire's heat) support mood but setting doesn't actively shape the protagonist's transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (mirror, mask, ash) creates emotional resonance. The theme of belonging through self-liberation is clear, though ending feels slightly pat. Subtext about fragmentation/cohesion is well-woven but lacks deeper philosophical complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some phrases (e.g., 'walking contradiction') are predictable. Plant communication angle adds originality but writing occasionally relies on lyrical abstraction over concrete imagery. Emotional progression feels somewhat preordained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically consistent whole but jigsaw puzzles and plant communication feel semi-incidental. The brief format sacrifices secondary character development, while thematic depth remains surface-level despite strong central metaphor.</comment>
