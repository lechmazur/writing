<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like eloquent silence and shattered allegiances are present but underexplored; motivations are mostly clear but lack psychological nuance, particularly in Eamon's transition from engineer to time master.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot advances through code decryption, but pacing falters in the middle; the resolution feels abrupt, and the tight word limit strains the emotional stakes of Eamon's choice, leaving the arc underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., neon flora, humming circuits) create a strong atmosphere, but the electronic wilderness feels more decorative than integral to the character's journey or thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of humility vs. vengeance are clear, and the misaligned harp offers metaphorical potential, but emotional resonance is undercut by overt exposition rather than subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting is original, but character reactions to the time-manipulation concept feel overly logical; the "distorted notes" motif occasionally succumbs to clich√©, and some phrasing leans toward overelaborate description without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements are technically integrated but strain cohesion; the story's brevity works against its ambitious themes, resulting in a narrative that feels more assembled than organically unified.</comment>
