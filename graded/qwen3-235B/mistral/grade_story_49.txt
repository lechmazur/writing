<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation exists conceptually but lacks emotional depth through action or subtext. Loyally peculiar aspect remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Predictable three-act structure within constraints; cause-effect logical but resolution feels rushed due to brevity. Intruder clash lacks tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Moonlit corridors and fog create vivid atmosphere; "charred serenity" tone works, but sensory details unevenly applied (e.g., silent tech without tactile description).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (magic = paintbrush, fog = emotion) resonate, but emotional impact diluted by explanatory narration. Ending ties to theme but lacks visceral payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uncommon blend of lunar magic realism avoids tropes, but "lukewarm" concept remains literal rather than metaphorical. Some purple prose ("whispers of dying lights").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused; the brevity highlights gaps (e.g., war backstory). Theme emerges but requires deeper weaving of concept into character behavior.</comment>
