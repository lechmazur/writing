<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Edith's introverted dancer background is consistent but lacks depth; her transition to decoder feels plausible through pattern recognition but her internal conflict only skims the surface of emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Begin-to-end progression exists (desolation to mastery) but pacing feels compressed; deciphering the code resolves the central tension yet the leap from knitting to cipher-solving lacks detailed logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (hum of machines, nebula yarn scent) effectively create an atmospheric sanctuary; astronomical charts ground the setting but the "cipher office" itself remains underutilized as a living space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (nebula yarn as both grief and cosmic connection) elevate the narrative; theme of finding strength through artistic hybridity resonates, though the "illogically logical" trope occasionally strains credulity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with dancer-decoder fusion but occasionally veers into "triumph over tragedy" predictability; atmospheric prose is vivid but occasionally borders on ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>High cohesion among elements (dancing, charts, knitting) creates a unified whole; brevity feels intentional but some concepts (e.g., "forgotten echoes") are underexplored, slightly diluting thematic impact.</grade>
