<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; motivation is clear but the shift in the politician lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; the pivotal relationship between Elias and the politician feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven; the subway timeframe and attic setting create strong imagery, but sensory details are inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (botanical samples, whispers) and thematic resonance; ending ties back to the setting but lacks layered emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality is hindered by familiar tropes (haunted attic, redemption arc); metaphors are sometimes striking but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive but constrained by design; themes resonate, yet some elements (e.g., politicianâ€™s transformation) feel schematic rather than organic.</comment>
