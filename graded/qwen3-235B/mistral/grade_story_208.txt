<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is nuanced but motivations are hinted at rather than fully explored; the relationship with the father's regrets could be deeper to justify actions like discarding the pen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arc is clear but pacing occasionally falters; the pen's disposal feels abrupt despite thematic buildup, and the suitcase motif is underdeveloped as a framing device.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated, with the concise form feeling intentional; leaves a lingering reflection on acceptance and absurdist humor without over-explanation.</comment>
