<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characterization is somewhat shallow; Eli's 'brainy observer' trait manifests through cataloging reactions but lacks psychological depth or growth. Motivation remains abstract without concrete emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to three-act shape within limits, but pacing feels compressed. The connection between discovering the doll and street art epiphany lacks nuanced psychological or practical development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting elements create vivid imagery (bioluminescence, FTL) but remain atmospheric adornments rather than narrative driving forces. Sensory details are present but unevenly distributed and occasionally generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story conveys a clear theme about historical memory through symbols, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy-handed exposition. The ending feels prematurely conclusive rather than earned through organic character transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Excessive florid description ("dance of awkward elegance") borders on purple prose. Recurring metaphor about fragility/strength lacks subversive dimension. Character logic feels simplified, particularly societal impact mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story remains structurally intact but fails to transcend its assigned elements. Certain components (faster-than-light travel) feel arbitrarily appended rather than organically integrated into thematic fabric.</comment>
