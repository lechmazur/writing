<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character has contradictory traits (impassive vs. curious longings) that lack depth, insufficiently explored motivations, and transformation feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Arc is minimal, pacing uneven, and plot logic (twist tie/bee connection) lacks grounding, undermining cohesion within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid yet clichéd imagery (sunlight/orchard) creates atmosphere, but the setting’s surreal contradiction (cathedral/orchard) weakens realism and thematic support.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uncommon elements like twist-tie/bee connection avoid clichés but veer toward gimmickry; prose avoids purple patches but lacks distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are superficially cohesive but strain suspension of disbelief; brevity is limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
