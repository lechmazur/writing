<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits exist but lack integration with deeper motivations; rebelliousness doesn't meaningfully shape actions or decisions, and prophetic aspect remains unexplored beyond nomenclature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progresses through assigned elements but relies on vague transitions; laundromat incident and study's spatial logic lack causal clarity, weakening coherence despite a superficial arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (scent of parchment, rustling books) immerse effectively; atmosphere aligns with haunting tone, but setting-character thematic connections remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (flower as fragile unity) and galaxy-eyed giant create visual resonance; ending lacks emotional payoff, and subtext about sacrifice remains hinted rather than felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some lush descriptions border on purple prose ("hum of distant thoughts"), while thematic elements recycle metaphysical tropes; avoids total formulaicity through atmospheric uniqueness but strains under abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesion hinges on aesthetic consistency rather than narrative necessity; brevity serves mood but sacrifices thematic depth, leaving concepts underexplored despite clever framing.</comment>
