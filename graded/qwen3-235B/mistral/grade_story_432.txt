<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's death wish lacks grounding in specific trauma or backstory; transformation feels abrupt despite initial potential. Motivation for mapping shifts inconsistently without clear emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arcs are present but compressed—energy flow discovery and ice collapse resolution rely on convenient coincidence rather than organic build-up within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like bioluminescent flora and toxic water create immersive atmosphere, but deeper exploration of Stygian society's unique culture is absent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Energy flow metaphor lacks sustained development; ending's "serene upheaval" is emotionally muted rather than resonant. Central conflict (toxin dependence) remains unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but stumbles with unconvincing elements like "talk-radio psychics" in underground society. Language stylized yet occasionally veers into vague "invisible rivers" clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story functions but elements strain coherence—radio psychics and ice sculpture feel forced. Lingering impression is aesthetic rather than thematic.</comment>
