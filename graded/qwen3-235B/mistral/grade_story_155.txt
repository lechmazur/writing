<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; trait "patiently impatient" inconsistently manifested, with little psychological depth to anchor his obsession with power beyond surface-level yearning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot feels compressed; pivotal shifts in timeline manipulation are handwavium, cause/effect lacks visceral stakes despite the thematic conclusion, sacrificing narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on gothic descriptors without grounding the planetarium/club’s decay in tactile specifics; missed opportunities to integrate sensory details with Eli’s internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Themes of hubris and acceptance lack emotional gravity; metaphorical language (e.g., "unraveling") is conceptually rich but underdelivered, leaning on moralizing over resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mix of fresh imagery ("collection of stolen moments") and clichéd cautionary tale elements; prose occasionally veers into artificial lyricism without sustaining a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Functional cohesion but struggles with brevity; many elements (e.g., mirrors, timelines) feel shoehorned into the concise framework, diluting their cumulative impact.</comment>
