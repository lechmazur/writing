<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Orion's muteness and ventriloquism are conceptually integral but underexplored; his optimism drives action but feels stated rather than deeply embodied. Cassio's role as a voice lacks emotional nuance, weakening the bond.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is clear but formulaic. Storm plot device creates momentum but resolution feels rushed. Pacing generally effective within constraints; cause-effect is logical but lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually vivid but unevenly realized worldbuilding. Two suns and crystalline elements create atmosphere but some details (e.g., upward rain) feel superficial. Sensory specifics enrich setting inconsistently.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of unconventional family and resilience resonate emotionally. Effective use of metaphor (weather archiving as hope) but dialogue occasionally veers into exposition. Ending lands thematically but lacks subtextual depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original setting elements avoid clich√©s but some tropes (storm rallying misfits) feel predictable. Language balances poetic and clear but occasionally overelaborate. Emotional beats could be more subtly conveyed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story functions cohesively but unevenly. Assigned elements are mostly utilized but feel occasionally gimmicky (e.g., seven-legged chef). Style supports narrative but lacks distinctive literary voice.</comment>
