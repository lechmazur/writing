<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shallowness in "lovable grumpiness" undermines complexity. Mayor's accidental status is underutilized as narrative device. Motivation for saving town is clear but lacks emotional anchoring through nuanced grumpy behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from mechanical convenience (beetle's supernatural effects). Time compression works for character arc but strains ecological transformation logic. Begins/ends effectively but middle relies too heavily on symbolic hand-waving.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong initial sensory grounding (polluted swamp details) contrasts with underdeveloped carnival and monk elements. Atmosphere shifts are vivid but lack transitional nuance. Timeframe enhances transformation theme but underuses dawn's symbolic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical resonance between mechanical beetle/environment works well. "Reluctant awe" effectively conveyed through sensory shifts rather than exposition. Ending feels earned but theme of wisdom vs technology remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Genre tropes (prophecy, magical object) persist with limited subversion. Sensory details specific but occasionally formulaic ("gnarled trees"). Emotional progression shows more than tells but transformation scene risks becoming checklist of fantastical elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere but reveal structural scaffolding. Concise format works beautifully for character revelation but strains ecological realism. The "accidental mayor" and "water wisdom" feel more plot-convenient than organically developed.</comment>
