<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Presents a clear but underdeveloped protagonist with fixed traits. Motivation drives the plot but lacks nuanced reactions or growth tied to being a car mechanic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent three-act structure within constraints, but rapid transitions lack necessary buildup. The gathering action shapes the plot but feels underexplored given the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Offers vivid, original imagery with the subterranean orchard but misses opportunities to connect setting elements (e.g., time-as-infinity) to emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective symbolism and thematic resonance, but occasionally relies on telling ("exultant grief") rather than showing. The cyclical ending provides closure but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors (river of stars, whispers as confessions) but occasionally employs familiar tropes (wishing wells, puzzle pieces) without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully integrates most elements into a cohesive whole, though pacing and underdeveloped thematic threads prevent it from transcending into exceptional literary territory.</comment>
