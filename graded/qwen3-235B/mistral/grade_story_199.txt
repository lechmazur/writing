<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is hindered by underexplored internal conflicts; motivations are clear but lack nuanced reactions or growth. The grandmother's influence feels symbolic but thinly sketched, weakening emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed in transitions (e.g., old woman's abrupt fade). The beginning-middle-end arc is present, though the tight word limit strains cause-and-effect clarity in key developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (scent of fruit, bees) immerse readers in the orchard’s atmosphere. The blend of concrete and nature enhances theme, but cosmic elements (faded dreams) feel vaguely realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is limited by reliance on mystical abstraction over concrete character moments. Effective symbolism (notebook, orchard) and quiet tension between decay and renewal, but pacing undercut impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details avoid cliché, but occasional ornate phrasing ("chaotic organization of nature and concrete") distracts. Avoids formulaic tropes through unique setting, but character reasoning feels underdeveloped rather than intentionally sparse.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted. The urban orchard grounds the story, while "familiarly unknown" and "chaotic organization" feel underexploited. Themes resonate faintly, lacking sustained emotional gravity.</comment>
