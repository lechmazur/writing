<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (to prove/disprove stories) is clear but lacks psychological depth; "dazed" trait remains underexplored; actions align with "empirically rebellious" attribute but feel externally imposed rather than internally driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tightly structured three-act progression within word constraints; chalk art driving plot is effective and logical; rising complexity of creations maintains momentum; minor pacing issues in establishing Edgar's background.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sound garden" concept is underutilized - limited specific sensory details about actual sounds; atmospheric tone inconsistent between academic setting and whimsical chalk works; connections between setting and thematic elements feel superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective metaphoric language and thematic clarity about logic/imagination interplay; lacks emotional resonance; ending satisfies but doesn't deepen themes; shows more than tells in visual descriptions but tells in emotional states.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but embraces art-vs-science trope without sufficient innovation; occasionally leans toward ornate description over substance; fresh concept execution partially undermined by conventional emotional arcs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not inseparable from the narrative; length effectively handled but feels somewhat compressed; combines assigned components successfully but doesn't transcend them; memorable central conceit outweighs surface-level thematic exploration.</comment>
