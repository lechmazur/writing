<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character sketching over development; traits named but not fully dramatized. The lovelorn spy motivation remains abstract despite atmospheric hints, failing to manifest in concrete decisions that shape the narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Meandering structure prioritizes mood over momentum. The meeting serves as flimsy narrative spine, with resolution feeling imposed rather than earned through character action within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visceral cyberpunk imagery elevates atmosphere (e.g., "decaying tech and desperate lives"), but excessive adjectives overwhelm subtler world-building, creating sensory overload that occasionally undermines thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose evokes melancholic introspection with lines like "heart as a museum of echoes," yet emotional beats often arrive pre-packaged rather than emerging organically from character interaction or specific details.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clich√©d cyberpunk trappings (neon slums, "rambling destiny" abstraction) undermine originality. Symbolism (sticky label as potential) feels contrived rather than surprising, with occasional purple prose detracting from emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High-concept elements coexist uneasily; the urban exploration method remains plot-functional rather than thematically integral. Certain components (avalance metaphor) resonate more strongly than others (recipe timeframe).</comment>
