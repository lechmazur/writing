<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment> Eli's conscientious objection is present but underdeveloped; "valiantly bored" is inconsistently portrayed. The rusty nail ritual lacks narrative weight, and motivations for joining the watch shift without sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum stalls between introducing Orion and resolving Eli's conflict. Pacing falters in midsection, with rushed rumors and abrupt emotional shifts. The unresolved ending weakens the arc despite thematic continuity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orchard's surreal imagery is vivid but atmospheric depth is uneven. The ravine's storms thematically mirror Eli's turmoil yet sensory details remain sparse. Craft fairs are namedropping without integration, leaving tonal dissonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story evokes contemplative unease through Eli's internal conflict but relies on underexplored symbols (nail, storms). Subtext about healing through nature exists but remains surface-level. Ending's tension between duty and conscience lacks cathartic payoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in conscientious objector portrayal but stumbles with "valiantly bored" diction. Orion's xenial action and ornithology angle feel fresh; however, some ornate descriptions ("battered by storms") strain naturalism. Emotion shown through nail rituals has human nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story maintains coherence but struggles to fully synthesize its elements within constraints. The ravine/orchard foundation anchors the narrative, but secondary components (craft fairs, family tradition) remain decorative rather than integral. Prompting reflection without landing thematic landing gear.</comment>
