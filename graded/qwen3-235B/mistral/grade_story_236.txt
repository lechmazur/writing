<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character remains passive; motivation is clear but transformation lacks internal/external stakes or tangible consequences. Meekness-to-resolve shift feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through exposition-heavy sequences; cause/effect logic holds but emotional stakes missing. Pacing uneven in middle, resolution abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on overused aquatic tropes; sparse sensory details (damp blueprints, seaweed) create vague immersion without distinct textures or logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (heart as furnace, light as stories) are conceptually engaging but executed with clich√©d emotional beats and sentimental ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on "unfinished bargain" fantasy trope without subversion; overuse of poetic descriptors ("luminous regret") veers into purple prose while underdeveloping narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story fragments cohere nominally but lacks thematic urgency; elements function as checklist rather than organic components of character or setting.</comment>
