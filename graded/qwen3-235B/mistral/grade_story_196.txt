<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Thorne’s apathy and hidden promise lack sufficient internal conflict depth; motivations feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague cause-effect (resignation → resolve); meteor showers as catalyst feel unearned within the tight arc, though thematic bookends work.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting’s magic hums faintly in the background; atmospheric details like meteor showers and monastery machinery are present but underutilized for immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Defiance-as-destiny metaphor resonates, but emotional impact relies too heavily on abstract phrasing (“knowing naivety”) over visceral delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original setting contrasted with clichéd themes (rekindling spirit, meteors as fate); prose balances clarity and occasionally flowery abstraction without collapsing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but rarely intersect—e.g., resignation’s role feels arbitrarily swapped; hidden promise drives the story but lacks contextual stakes.</comment>
