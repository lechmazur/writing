<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Flickering motivation development; comically serious trait underexplored. The belt's significance drives plot but not deeply internalized character logic. Mountaineer feels like plot device rather than embodied character. Voice consistency weakened by third-person's inconsistent psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ionization concept strains plausibility. Film reel method poorly explained despite centrality. Pacing stumbles between atmospheric pauses and abrupt decisions. Timeframe intermission device creates artificial tension. Ending fails to resolve moral stakes of experimental ethics or ancestral quest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (thin air, storm energy, leather smell) effectively establish Himalayan extremity. Setting's liminality between refuge and laboratory enhances conceptual tension. Some dissonance between tea house's warmth and botanical menace remains underexploited. Sensory integration mostly purposeful but occasionally superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Emotional engagement crippled by detached narration and underdeveloped stakes. Symbolism (belt ↔ inheritance, storm ↔ psyche) introduced but mechanically executed. Thematic potential about obsession's cost lost in narrative distance. Telling dominates over showing, particularly in unearned emotional pivot toward guilt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Clichéd mad scientist archetype recycled without meaningful subversion. Overeager pile-up of tropes (storm as metaphor, ancestral films, carnivorous plants as quasi-horrific) produces narrative whiplash. Purple prose affects descriptions of phenomena. Character psychology reduced to simplistic binary. Tension between science and mysticism remains superficially gestural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Element integration feels assembly-line rather than organically composed. Forced application of constraints visible in stilted motivations and awkward object incorporations. Prose occasionally achieves atmospheric poetry but undermined by conceptual inconsistencies. Brevity works against emotional complexity development. Lingering impression of unfinished thematic blueprint rather than realized fiction.</comment>
