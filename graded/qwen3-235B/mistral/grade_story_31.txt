<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters show basic growth but motivations lack depth; Eli's solemnity feels underexplored, and Mira's "endearingly irritating" trait occasionally veers into caricature rather than fully realized motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Predictable arc undermines coherence; while cause-effect relationships exist, the expedited pacing (especially post-locker discovery) rushes emotional payoff that could have deepened the "connection/disconnection" theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vibrant cyberpunk contrasts with garden setting, but sensory immersion remains superficial; the "hush between heartbeats" concept could have been better utilized for atmospheric tension rather than just initiating the inciting incident.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of intergenerational connection and technological isolation resonate, though some emotional beats (Eli's tearful VR moment) feel telegraphed rather than organically earned through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains traces of AI-patterned phrasing ("whirling virtual windstorm"); Mira's tech prowess occasionally feels contrived (e.g., easily repairing decades-old VR device strains suspension of disbelief).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion exists but rarely surprises; the rooftop garden as thematic metaphor works conceptually but lacks the visceral impact needed to elevate it beyond competent genre storytelling.</comment>
