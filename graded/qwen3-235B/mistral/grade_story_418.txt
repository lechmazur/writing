<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's headstrong nature is thematic but underexplored beyond surface actions; motivations are clear but lack psychological complexity; integration with objects like the stained glass box reveals determination but could deepen emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Magic infusion drives plot effectively, but pacing rushes the transformation's emotional weight; resolution is visually satisfying but conceptually sparse; cause-effect of glitter-to-box connection lacks grounding in world logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Radioactive dust storms and glowing fruits create visceral atmosphere; sensory details like glitter's residue evoke texture, but the "merry bitterness" tone remains underdeveloped beyond superficial contrasts of gray/color.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., stained glass box as hope) resonate, but subtext about art's resilience feels surface-level; ending teases thematic ambition but lacks closure; emotional beats rely on poetic phrasing over organic character reaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Overwrought phrases ("merry bitterness") and generic descriptors ("softness and light") tip toward purple prose; magic system and glitter method verge on fantastical arbitrariness; character reasoning leans on archetypal "mancer" tropes without nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere visually (color vs gray) but lack thematic synergy; brevity works for imagery but hinders emotional resonance; creative use of radioactive orchard is undercut by formulaic redemption arc.</comment>
