<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but superficial; "factually imaginative" trait lacks concrete manifestation in actions beyond passive observation. The transition from aimlessness to purpose feels abrupt despite the heirloom's presence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges on contrived hopscotch-board-as-key; cause-effect logic weakens under scrutiny (e.g., how does noting patterns reveal "seeds of vigilance"?). The arc is emotionally resolved but structurally uneven due to compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich tactile details (dust, melting snow) establish atmosphere, but the archive's purpose and cultural specifics remain vague. Sensory immersion peaks with handkerchief/husks imagery but lacks consistency beyond surface aesthetic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dual tone of "mournful elation" resonates poignantly through recipe-as-storytelling, but emotional impact is diluted by overused metaphors ("hushed world"). The theme of cultural preservation feels urgent yet occasionally schematic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Persistent clich√©s (e.g., "hopscotch board holding secrets") and abstract descriptors ("layers of history and possibility") verge on formulaic. While the metaphor of recipes-as-culture is strong, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of lonely travelers rediscovering purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but strained; the handkerchief and hopscotch board function more as plot devices than organic narrative components. Leaves a lingering idea about cultural preservation but lacks transformative execution.</comment>
