<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear motivation (tempting silent oracle) drives actions, but emotional depth feels surface-level; plastic spoon as childhood relic hints at nuance but isn't fully exploited. Character's "roughly refined" exile informs decisions, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Library time constraint creates urgency, but plot resolution feels abrupt; decoding dream catchers as method lacks concrete payoff within tight structure. Connection between fortress backstory and present action remains tenuous despite thematic parallels.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Floating fortress above deserts creates vivid, haunting atmosphere with tactile heat descriptions, but metaphysical library section clashes tonally. Sensory details like "dusty tomes" and plastic spoon's texture ground the surreal setting without overloading it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (oracle as snuffed candle, heart as drum) elevate material, while the plastic spoon functions effectively as recurring symbol. Ending avoids sentimentality but leaves emotional payoff ambiguous rather than satisfyingly resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual elements (floating fortress, dream catcher ciphers), but "roughly refined existence" phrasing borders on pretentious abstraction. Subtext about memory and legacy feels genuine despite occasional over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Exile/quest framework holds together through strong central symbols, but integration of all assigned elements strains plausibility. Word limit sacrifices deeper exploration of key dynamics (e.g., apothecary's banishment cause).</comment>
