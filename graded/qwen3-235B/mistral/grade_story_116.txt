<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are present but lack emotional depth; reactions to objects like the watch band and photographs remain more symbolic than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from despair to inspiration, but the middle section relies on abrupt visual cues (e.g., the photograph of the park) without sufficient narrative momentum to justify the emotional shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pervasive neon-lit twilight and hydroponic vines create a vivid, immersive atmosphere; however, some descriptors (e.g., "laconic exuberance") feel underdeveloped conceptually.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (broken watch band as temporal defiance, mapping as existential purpose) are effective, but emotional resonance leans on poetic abstraction over subtextual depth or surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some tropes (isolated artist, haunted by time) recur without subversion, and vague phrases like "garden secrets" border on cliché; originality emerges in the city’s defiance of time boundaries.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Servicable cohesion with assigned elements, but the sky-lounge and "garden secrets" feel occasionally shoehorned; the ending lingers, though its thematic weight feels unevenly distributed.</comment>
