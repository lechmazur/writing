<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited growth; motivations felt surface-level despite actions aligning with traits. Nuances between desperation and optimism underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., candle-making to gamble) and underdeveloped stakes despite a clear arc. Pacing uneven in word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (machinery, candlelight) set mood, but minimal sensory engagement beyond visual elements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts subversion of gambling tropes but falters with predictable arcs (redemption via risk). Stylistic risks (e.g., Marigoldâ€™s lectures) occasionally veer into melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Concepts overlap without cohesion; ambitious themes undercut by underdeveloped tension and uneven style (mixes poetic and simplistic prose).</comment>
