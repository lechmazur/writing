<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters are thinly developed; Eli's motivation is stated rather than demonstrated, and Magnus functions more as a thematic device than a fleshed-out figure. Interactions lack depth, and neither character exhibits nuance or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc is clear but predictable; wedding timeframe adds little narrative weight. Transition between setup and conclusion feels slight, though thematic consistency maintains minimal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere is vivid but serves as backdrop rather than narrative force. Sensory details like oil scent and steam hum add immersion, but setting doesn't substantially shape character or plot beyond ambiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "waves against a cliff" hint at subtext, but emotional impact is muted. Thematic continuity exists, yet ending feels more resigned than resonant, relying on stated wisdom over earned insight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story avoids overt tropes but fails to subvert genre conventions. Some purple prose ("last good intention") weakens authenticity. Emotional beats are described, not embodied, and pacing lacks stylistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly integrated; wedding timeframe feels tacked on. Theme lingers faintly, but execution prioritizes concept over immersive storytelling. Competent but unremarkable in totality.</comment>
