<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Premise lacks emotional depth; Eli's grief and obsession with mapping railways remain underexplored. The hairbrush serves as a symbol but fails to meaningfully reveal character nuance. Motivation for burying the railway's truth isn't connected to his personal journey until a perfunctory conclusion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Incomplete map numbers and echo measurement mechanics drive plot but feel contrived. Pacing collapses under word limit - buried railway revelation arrives too abruptly, with cause-effect gaps between tower investigation and town conspiracy. Ending resolution feels tacked on rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Radiowave garden's metallic flowers create vivid atmosphere but disconnect from thematic core. Water tower decay is evocative but over-explains its symbolic role. Sensory details like "repeating pebble plinks" effectively immerse but cannot compensate for tenuous object-setting connections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Potential themes of truth's redemptive power surface then recede. Some effective metaphors (railways as silent veins, hairbrush tarnish) but emotional beats rely too heavily on explicit statements ("weight lifted"). Ending's "beacon of hope" lacks earned transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Monument to loneliness" and "veins of forgotten industry" reek of algorithmic flourishes. Overused poetic structures (paradox descriptors, excessive metallic similes) suggest formulaic expression. Sudden hospital monitor inclusion feels artificially imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Assigned elements crammed into fractured narrative that prioritizes concept checklist over organic cohesion. Brief length exacerbates rather than enhances - feels like outline rather than complete story. Redemptive arc resolution lacks narrative authority to linger in reader consciousness.</comment>
