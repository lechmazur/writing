<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivations and "quiet defiance" remain abstract concepts rather than lived experiences, with insufficient emotional grounding or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative structure follows a clear trajectory toward the star-aligned climax, but progression feels rushed in shorter segments; the beginning/end connection is functional yet underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (atomic hum, shimmering light) create atmosphere, but the lighthouse feels more symbolic than integral; the "forgotten empire" lacks tangible connection to the setting's physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "borrowed dawn") and metaphorical resonance elevate the prose, but emotional impact is diluted by heavy reliance on existential abstraction rather than experiential storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar melancholic time-travel tropes; phrasing occasionally veers into ornateness without achieving profound originality or subversion of expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</comment>Overall cohesion exists, but the story prioritizes lyrical tone over narrative urgency; some elements feel conceptually tied rather than organically integrated, diminishing thematic weight.</comment>
