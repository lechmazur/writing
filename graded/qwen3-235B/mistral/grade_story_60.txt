<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks deeper exploration of indifference; emotional reactions are stated rather than shown through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight for the word limit, but the connection between the haw sound and the creature feels underdeveloped, slightly weakening cause-and-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create an immersive atmosphere, though some elements like the cathedral bells could integrate more meaningfully with the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Use of symbolism (ribbon, cuff) adds depth, but the covenant’s emotional weight feels rushed, lowering its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mix of original and semi-tropey elements (ribbon as grief symbol); dialogue and logic avoid clichés but occasionally lean on predictable phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive use of elements creates a resonant, if slight, narrative; some assigned pieces (e.g., "between bells") could feel more essential.</comment>
