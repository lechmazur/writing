<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Oracle's motivation to rewrite history is clear and tied to her existence, but the 'independently dependent' attribute is underdeveloped beyond a single mention. Her 'voice' remains ethereal but lacks distinctness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is cohesive with a clear arc, but the tight word limit forces rushed transitions between key moments. The ceremonial rope's method feels logically connected but lacks procedural specificity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory decay and resurrection motifs. The carnival's subconscious realm and perfume bottle's symbolism are evocatively linked to the oracle's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (time-woven rope, deflated existence) elevate the narrative. Ending is satisfying but lacks deeper subtext about the cost of rebirth. Central conflict is resolved too tidily for maximum emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original conceits (subconscious carnival, independently dependent oracle) stand out, but contains traces of ornate prose and slightly generic transitions (e.g., 'melancholic glee,' 'dreamlike invitations') that reduce uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are coherently integrated but occasionally feel checklist-driven (e.g., 'independently dependent' isn't fully dramatized). The theme of self-reclamation through rewriting history emerges effectively.</comment>
