<question>1</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Superficial motivation; the 'dutiful scholar' trait inconsistently drives actions. Emotional depth feels imposed rather than earned through specific behaviors or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Predictable structure with underdeveloped cause-effect. The arc collapses under word constraints; contamination lacks suspense. Plot momentum relies on unearned epiphany.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Vague sensory details fail to ground 'uncommonly typical' setting. 'Capsule hotel' worldbuilding is decorative, not thematic. Tone-technology disconnect undermines atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Forced thematic resonance; emotional payoff feels narrated, not demonstrated. The ending lacks narrative teeth despite ambitious concept hints. Overexplained rather than evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on genre clich√©s (forbidden knowledge, time traveler regret) without reinvention. Prose vacillates between sterile exposition and melodramatic declarations. Voice lacks individuality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven, not organic. The 'test' timeframe's significance evaporates. Premise suggests potential, but execution lacks literary precision or urgency.</comment>
