<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While Kaito's paradoxical traits are established, their integration into his actions feels superficial; his "detached precision" manifests through swordsmanship references but lacks deeper exploration of inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with cause-effect clarity, but the 500-word constraint creates rushed transitions (e.g., instant discovery of Yumi's vow); the collage-to-sea progression is logical yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The neon-tinged futuristic city establishes mood but lacks unique sensory texture (over-reliance on visual cues); the recycling center's potential as a thematic counterpoint to sterile progress remains minimally exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Romantic themes of reclaiming lost dreams resonate through symbolic sea pottery and collage metaphors; emotional impact is diluted by exposition-heavy character summaries rather than immersive showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise avoids genre clich√©s but contains intermittently flowery prose ("dance in the realm of reality") and predictable character motivation arcs; collage reassembly concept is inventive but occasionally feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Story incorporates required elements but frequently prioritizes them structurally over organic development; the brief form works thematically but sacrifices interpersonal nuance and worldbuilding depth.</comment>
