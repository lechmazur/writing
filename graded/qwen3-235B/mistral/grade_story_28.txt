<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation is present but superficial; his family tradition backstory doesn't fully inform his actions. Reactions to the fork lack psychological depth, though the desperation behind his optimism is hinted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure (search-find-confrontation-resolution) but resolution feels abrupt within the word limit. The connection between finding the fork and accepting the tradition lacks narrative bridge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative decay details ("faded paint," "rustling leaves voice") but folklore connections remain underdeveloped. Sensory immersion inconsistently maintained, particularly in dialogue scenes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ending creates thematic resonance about tradition preservation through physical objects. Lacks emotional complexity; the "key to the future" metaphor is effective but undercut by abrupt tonal shifts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Contains tropes (abandoned carnival, crossroad demons) with minimal subversion. Some forced language ("desperate optimism") and uneven emotional showing vs. telling. Attempts subtext about cultural erosion but lacks originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated. The carnival setting feels more like a checklist item than environmental necessity. Theme emerges but remains surface-level. Brevity undermines narrative depth.</comment>
