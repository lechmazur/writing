<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Initial contradiction between skepticism and artistry sets up potential depth. Weakness: Internal transformation feels rushed and insufficiently earned through action. Motivation lacks layered complexity beyond surface-level "expose trickster/find inspiration."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strengths: Clear contest framework progresses from invitation to resolution. Weakness: Pacing uneven - Loki's extravagant acts underdeveloped, pivotal "hope through song" segment compressed, emotional beats require greater narrative weight within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Strengths: Steam vents and factory offer evocative decay imagery. Weakness: Disconnected sensory elements - "hiss of ancient steam vents" repeated without distinctive olfactory/tactile integration, "disappearing ink" concept underdeveloped in atmospheric texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Metaphor of music restoring belief works conceptually; theme of transformative generosity resonates. Weakness: Reliance on stated emotions ("restored faith in humanity") rather than fully dramatized shifts; subtext weakened by over-explanation in conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strengths: Unconventional combination of industrial decay with magic restoration. Weakness: Some flat descriptors ("whispered secrets," "trustworthy slingshot") lean toward generic fantasy troping rather than fresh specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Central concept coherence despite multiple required elements. Weakness: Several components (ink factory, steam vent method) feel peripherally attached rather than structurally integral to the emotional core.</comment>
