<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations (preservation of ancient methods) are clear and drive the narrative effectively. Feistiness is hinted through boldness but lacks consistent behavioral reinforcement. Intellectually playful trait manifests in invention but isn't deeply explored beyond surface tinkering.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear beginning-to-end trajectory exists, but pacing inconsistencies emerge in rapid transition from ticket discovery to final exhibition. Morphing action via heat is well-integrated conceptually but under-explained practically. Cause-effect logic holds, though creative process compression feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Space debris studio setting creates compelling tension between high-tech waste and Eli's analog artistry. Atmospheric details (oil scent, flickering shadows) work, but more could explore sensory contrast between mechanical noise/chaos and quiet flame symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes nostalgic wonder through kinetic art metaphors ("tickets fluttering like butterfly wings"). Theme of technological continuity resonates, but lacks emotional complexity beyond sentimental admiration. Ending satisfying yet surface-level in philosophical depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original in concept blending steampunk aesthetics with space salvage, but contains sentimental clich√©s ("warm, flickering light"). Some purple prose ("feisty spirit sparking in his eyes"). Character reasoning occasionally simplistic; Eli's emotional arc remains underdeveloped despite transformative exhibition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements integrated with purpose but uneven depth. Space studio and oil lamps crucially shape both plot and theme, while car rides/feisty descriptors feel peripherally attached. Brief length works for parable structure but limits character complexity development.</comment>
