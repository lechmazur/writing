<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract concept without personal growth; motivation is stated but thinly demonstrated through actions. Lacks human nuance or distinct voice despite stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear beginning/middle/end; whale call and dancer's timing create tension. Pacing strained by word count in atmospheric sections; resolution feels abrupt but thematically coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (brackish wisdom, whale song) but relies on generic hauntings; sensory details effective but occasionally overwritten ("palpable anticipation"). Lighthouse's decay lacks visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resonant themes through whale/whistle symbology; ending achieves emotional closure. Subtext about cultural preservation is clear but underpinned by telling rather than layered implication. Conflict remains small-scale but meaningful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overuse of "ancient" and oceanic clich√©s; plastic whistle adds novelty. Some abrupt tonal shifts ("brazen calm") and overly dense phrasing ("brackish water of wisdom") suggest padding within constraints.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Functional cohesion; elements serve premise without feeling inevitable. Style leans on lyrical abstraction as both strength and evasion. Leaves lingering thematic resonance but lacks piercing originality.</comment>
