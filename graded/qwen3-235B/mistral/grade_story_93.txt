<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Edmund's crisis and motivation remain abstract; his actions lack visceral connection to sacred geometry or unspoken bonds. Eliza's role feels underdeveloped despite her pivotal gesture. Dialogue and internal monologue lack distinct voice or emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a vague "crisis" resolved too quickly by Eliza's map. The migration archive setting and pirate radio establish atmosphere but don't drive narrative progression. Pacing is uneven, with abrupt shifts in emotional stakes and unresolved farewell's implications.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Rich visual descriptors ("dusty corridors," "creaking elevator") evoke isolation, but the migration pattern archive feels underutilized as a living space. Sensory details about the radio's hum and tactile interactions with calling cards are effective but inconsistently applied to other elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (labyrinths as isolation, sacred geometry as emotional cartography) are evocative but occasionally heavy-handed. The ending circles back to the radio's "desperate hope," creating thematic cohesion. Some emotional beats are stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on overly romanticized tropes (lonely genius, pirate radio mystique) and inconsistently vivid details. The "language of the heart" ending veers toward clich√©. Dialogue and character psychology lack the specific quirks that distinguish human-written prose, though the archive's labyrinthine structure shows ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mosaic of assigned elements lacks narrative urgency; feels like checklist fulfillment rather than organic storytelling. The tight word limit amplifies structural weaknesses, while superficially "literary" styling (e.g., italicized metaphor clusters) can't mask underdeveloped emotional stakes.</comment>
