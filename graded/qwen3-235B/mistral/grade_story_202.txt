<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematic but underexplored; the poisoner trait feels superficially tied to her actions beyond preservation metaphor. Emotional depth remains surface-level despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tidy puzzle-solving arc but sacrifices tension for brevity; scavenger hunt mechanics feel slightly contrived, though the museum setting allows organic integration of clues.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Museum atmosphere is vividly realized through tactile details ("glassy stares," "worn concrete"), creating a tangible contrast between the stillness inside and energetic skateboarding outside that reinforces thematic duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (gravity, poisoning/preserving) add depth; ending resonates thematically but leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned emotional payoff. Subtly asks readers to ponder preservation vs. oblivion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally drifts toward literary affectation ("dusty starlight"). Character logic remains humanized, though the scavenger hunt leans on coincidence rather than organic discovery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements generally support cohesion, though the skateboarding motif and poisoner aspect feel loosely connected to the central narrative. The rapier's role feels essential, elevating the story beyond checklist-driven execution.</comment>
