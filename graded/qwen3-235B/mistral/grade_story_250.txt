<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivation is clear but not fully embodied through nuanced actions or consistent voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but compressed; cause-effect logic holds, though the ending feels abrupt and underdeveloped within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with sensory details, but setting elements (e.g., temple/ticker) clash in plausibility and integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mix of effective imagery and forced exposition; theme resonates, but emotional subtlety is undercut by explicit declarations of tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Combines unusual elements (ticker in temple) with some originality but leans on predictable tropes (ailing sibling, chosen-one arc) without sufficient subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements are unevenly integrated; some (teddy bear, battle) are vital, while others (temple, ticker) strain cohesion and thematic clarity.</comment>
