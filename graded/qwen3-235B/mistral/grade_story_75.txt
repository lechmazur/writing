<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear but abstractly defined; her "skeptically credulous" trait is stated rather than dramatized through specific actions. Transformation from guarded to leader is under-earned due to limited emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent but overly condensed; pivotal shifts (e.g., community collaboration) feel rushed. The decryption method drives the plot but lacks procedural depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting remains a shallow backdrop; the nano-forest's unique scale isn't leveraged for sensory or symbolic impact. Atmosphere leans on underdeveloped "tiny world" shorthand.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of cultural reclamation are evident but surface-level. The ending's metaphorical resonance is undermined by didacticism rather than organic emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original world-building (nano-forest, plastic bookmark) contrasts with predictable arcs (lone seeker to community leader). Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on semi-generic "angry peace" framing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but unevenly weighted; grassroots movement and nano-forest feel appended rather than foundational. Strong ideas undercut by underdeveloped execution.</comment>
