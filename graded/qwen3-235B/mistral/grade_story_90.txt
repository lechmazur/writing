<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rigidity and contrition are visually present but lack psychological depth; motivation drives plot yet feels externally imposed rather than emerging organically from Silas's history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Efficient structure with beginning/middle/end, but critical transitions (bodyguard's shift, tattoo revelation) lack sufficient causal buildup; momentum wavers during exposition-heavy dialogue.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Floating spa's surreal potential underutilized beyond surface descriptions; sensory details remain visually dominant; tone oscillates between whimsy and gravitas without full integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (yarn as redemption, tattoos as deceit) effective but overt; emotional resonance undercut by stylized prose that occasionally distances reader from character stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual elements but relies on redemption trope conventions; vocabulary remains purposeful yet occasionally ventures into ornamental abstraction without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Required elements competently interwoven but not transformative; brevity works for economy yet sacrifices nuance; thematically clear but lacks lingering philosophical complexity.</grade>
