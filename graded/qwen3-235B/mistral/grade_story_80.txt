<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits are presented but lack emotional depth; "ingeniously clueless" remains conceptually abstract rather than manifesting in authentic contradictions through actions or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a conventional mystery arc but relies heavily on convenient discoveries (map, hidden door) without sufficient buildup; connections between haunted inns and roller coaster remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through decay and isolation imagery, but the specific timeframe element ("amid page turns") fails to meaningfully intersect with setting or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory imagery elevates immersion, but lacks thematic subtext or unexpected metaphoric resonance; the ending resolves too cleanly without lingering emotional or philosophical impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on well-worn mystery tropes (abandoned attractions, ominous journals) with minimal subversion; atmospheric descriptions occasionally lapse into formulaic purple prose rather than distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent mystery but lack deeper integration; some assigned components (e.g., "ingeniously clueless") feel arbitrarily attached rather than organically driving the narrative.</comment>
