<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but transitions in Kael's internal conflict feel rushed. Mannequins provide thematic voice but lack depth beyond symbolic roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot structure follows an arc but feels compressed. The pivotal realization lacks sufficient buildup, creating an abrupt shift from ambition to acceptance without full emotional integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting details create a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. Rust, shadows, and chipped mannequins reinforce themes, but sensory engagement beyond visuals remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of imperfection and progress resonate, with symbolic objects enhancing meaning. Emotional impact remains somewhat surface-bound despite strong imagery and closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with original concepts, though sentient mannequins border on familiar tropes. Language remains purposeful but occasionally leans on lyrical simplicity over nuanced emotional layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements, but some (e.g., "wrath of a star") feel underutilized. The theme lingers thoughtfully, though brevity limits narrative penetration.</comment>
