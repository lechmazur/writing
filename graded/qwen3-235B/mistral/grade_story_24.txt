<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Flawed by generic archetypes; Eamon's motivations lack psychological depth despite surface coherence. The teeth-less puppet isn't meaningfully connected to character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Linear but uninspired structure; pacing works but lacks tension or narrative surprises within tight constraints. Emotional payoff feels preordained rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric potential squandered; labyrinthine setting described but underutilized. Sensory details present but unevenly distributed, often feeling decorative rather than integrally connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism with dentures, but lacks tonal experimentation. Emotional beats are explicit rather than subtly embedded. Theme of human warmth competently executed but not innovatively explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality in dentures-as-artifact concept undermined by conventional bard trope and sentimental resolution. Some vivid phrases ("belly of a mountain") contrast with formulaic expressions ("hearts grown cold").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structurally sound with polished prose but feels like an elegantly constructed fragment rather than a maximally impactful standalone piece. Conceptual elements more coexisting than synergistically fused.</comment>
