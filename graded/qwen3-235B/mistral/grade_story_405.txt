<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Edmund's traits shape his cautious decisions and self-deception, but emotional depth could be more visceral rather than abstract. Motivation to guide others is rooted in personal loss, though reactions occasionally lean on internal monologue over embodied behavior.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution, but transitions between obsession and redemption feel slightly rushed. Cause-effect between petal discovery and thematic breakthrough lacks incremental tension needed in tight word limits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in olfactory and tactile details (damp mushrooms, decaying seats) that mirror psychological decay, though cryptic scrawls deserve deeper integration. The frantic peace tone juxtaposes effectively against somber surroundings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (petals as preserved memory, mushrooms as transient sustenance) operates on multiple levels. Ending achieves emotional resonance through auditory imagery (echoed laughter) rather than exposition. Subtext about grief's circularity implied through farm-as-labyrinth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids maudlin grief tropes by tethering them to fungal life cycles. Petal discovery subverts expected "message in a bottle" clich√©s through ambiguity. Occasional overuse of "frantic" weakens impact, but metaphors remain largely organic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements serve thematic unity (gambling = grief processing; petals = memory preservation). Short form enhances urgency rather than limiting it. Lingers through juxtaposition of decay and renewal, though emotional payoff slightly diluted by compressed arc.</comment>
