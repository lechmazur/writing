<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks nuanced internal/external conflict development; motivations align with traits but feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded. The broken zipper pull's significance is hinted but underexplored narratively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc but suffers from compressed pacing; the nebula-to-folktale connection feels contrived despite thematic purpose, undermining cause-effect cohesion. Resolution resolves too neatly for the depth of existential struggle presented.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes cosmic and urban imagery effectively but offers minimal sensory immersion beyond vague "vibrant" descriptions. The nebula observation deck's atmospheric potential remains underutilized as the narrative's emotional and symbolic center.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolic duality (cage/cosmos; truth/myth) elevates thematic resonance. Emotional impact is diffused by over-reliance on abstraction; ending lacks visceral payoff despite clever framing devices and subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but employs some formulaic existential phrasing ("watchful eyes of the nebulas"). Subtext is intellectually engaging but occasionally overwritten; the tone occasionally teeters toward self-consciously literary rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; the nebula-folktale linkage feels artificially imposed rather than organically discovered. Achieves thematic unity but lacks memorable stylistic distinctiveness or lasting emotional resonance despite ambitious ideas.</comment>
