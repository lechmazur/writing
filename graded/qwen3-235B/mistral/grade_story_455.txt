<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to scars and ghosts are present but underexplored; the dissonance between Karelâ€™s spy past and present role feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on abrupt revelations; the encounter feels slightly forced, though the tight word limit is managed competently.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cobblestones, shadows) and Cold War-era Prague enhance atmosphere; tone and setting are effectively aligned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (coins, scars) and subtext about redemption elevate impact, but emotional resonance is uneven; ending feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some tropes (spy ghosts, scarred protagonists) feel familiar; the coin motif and Prague setting offer mild ingenuity but fall short of transcendent originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate modestly well but lack cohesion; the story leans on its atmospheric setting more than narrative innovation.</comment>
