<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Edmond's insecurity is stated but not deeply explored; his sudden transformation lacks nuance. Motivation to pursue the rumor is clear but underdeveloped, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot momentum falters from rushed pacing; the feedback loop resolution feels abrupt despite effective use of the "jab" action. The beginning/end connection is functional but surface-level.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong (dust, silence, "simmering future") but sensory details are inconsistently tied to plot logic; the HQ’s labyrinthine quality isn’t fully leveraged thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative phrases ("fractured idyll") and the twist of the brain as the dreamer work, but emotional depth is undercut by reliance on declarative statements over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some predictable tropes (brain-in-jar) and generic descriptors ("eerie light") undermine originality. Tension between "clearly ambiguous" and narrative coherence feels unresolved.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story holds together but feels like a framework for elements rather than a cohesive whole. Ending hints at layered meaning but doesn’t fully land.</comment>
