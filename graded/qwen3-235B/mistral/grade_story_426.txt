<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; the "angrily peaceful" attribute lacks nuanced expression, while the sudden shift from isolation to embracing the stranger feels undermotivated despite the folk medicine thread providing some cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from discovery to decoding to the stranger’s arrival, but the tight word limit sacrifices pacing balance—the teapot/USB revelation is compelling, while the ending’s abrupt emotional pivot disrupts the arc’s cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The decaying amusement park creates a vivid, eerie atmosphere, with sensory details grounding the setting; however, the connection between the ghost train’s symbolism and Eli’s arc remains superficial despite strong environmental immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story’s core ideas (forgotten knowledge, isolation) resonate conceptually, but emotional beats lack depth due to rushed execution; the "hug" climax is poignant but inadequately foreshadowed, weakening its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise combines original concepts (hacking music playlists for recipes) with familiar tropes (abandoned parks, hacker puzzles), but the USB drive’s inclusion feels anachronistic and underexamined, bordering on gimmickry; dialogue is sparse, limiting character nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The story integrates assigned elements competently but unevenly; the teapot and folk medicine drive narrative momentum, while the "alᵒof passion" and marathon training feel ancillary; the abrupt resolution hints at untapped thematic depth.</comment>
