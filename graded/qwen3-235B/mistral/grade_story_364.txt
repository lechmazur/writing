<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Amelia's skewed vision is linked to her focus on the mundane, but her internal motivations and psychology remain underdeveloped, making her more symbolic than fully fleshed-out.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; the marketplace interaction is well-paced, yet the transition to the conclusion about her influence on colleagues lacks gradual build.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective sensory details ground the Institute and marketplace, but the temporal anomaly mechanics are underexplored, weakening the coherence of the world-building.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and subtext effectively (e.g., lace as a vanishing trade), but emotional resonance is somewhat surface-level; the ending feels slightly pat rather than profound.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids heavy clichés but borders on poetic abstraction; some phrases ("cryptically clear tapestry") feel strained, and the time travel mechanics are standard rather than inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic urgency; the story’s brevity works against deeper exploration of assigned concepts, resulting in a polished but lightweight narrative.</comment>
