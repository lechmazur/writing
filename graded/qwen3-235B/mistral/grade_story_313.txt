<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but abrupt; Eli shifts from con artist to rebellion leader without sufficient psychological groundwork. His "unusually normal" trait isn't fully distinguished from his con artist identity. Interactions with the ghost reveal curiosity but lack emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure shows progression but feels rushed—meeting the ghost to rebellion planning compresses character growth and resistance logistics into insufficient space. Causality between ghostly revelations and action lacks concrete detail. Pacing balances atmosphere and action unevenly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting establishes oppressive grayness effectively, but sensory details remain surface-level (cold air, faded wallpaper). Contrast between past lushness and present decay is underutilized. Atmosphere supports themes but lacks immersive particularity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ideas about hope through collective resistance are present, but emotional resonance suffers from underdeveloped relationships and stakes. The tape dispenser's symbolism feels forced rather than organically integrated. Ending lacks satisfying narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ideas like "taunt the jaws of defeat" are phrase-heavy rather than conceptually fresh. Ghost trope follows predictable redemption arc. Writing avoids purple prose but leans on familiar dystopian motifs (oppressive overseers, propaganda broadcasts) without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative achieves basic cohesion but elements (tape dispenser, "unusually normal") strain the story’s logic. Short length highlights underdeveloped threads rather than feeling intentional. Memorable core conflict but diluted execution.</comment>
