<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation for overcoming prejudice is clear but lacks depth in showing gradual transformation. Evelyn's shift feels abrupt, undermining the emotional weight of her change. The phantom train punch could better reveal character nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure is coherent but constrained by word count, causing rushed pacing in Evelyn’s internal arc. The decay metaphor drives plot effectively, but cause-effect between the chance encounter and prejudice dissolution lacks layered development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting details like dust motes and cracked windows evoke atmosphere, but sensory engagement remains surface-level. The abandoned hangar’s symbolic connection to prejudice is strong, though tone inconsistencies emerge in dialogue scenes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Weaving decay and human connection creates thematic resonance, but emotional impact is muted by overt symbolism. The ending resolves neatly without lingering ambiguity, and subtext about historical preservation is thinly developed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concepts like “phantom punch” avoid clichés but the “prejudice dissolution via heart-to-heart” trope follows predictable emotional beats. Some ornate phrasing (“dust motes danced”) feels forced. Subtler handling of character nuance would elevate authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story holds cohesion despite element density, though the farmer’s market encounter and acceptance speech timeframe strain plausibility. The professional cuddler profession adds thematic contrast but isn’t fully leveraged. Ends on a reflective note lacking narrative punch.</comment>
