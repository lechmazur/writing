<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pitch-perfect inquisitiveness drives Eli but psychological depth absent. Motivation to decode cosmic secrets feels consistent yet superficial, with minimal evolution beyond curiosity. Interactions with spirits hint at ritualistic relationship but lack layered exploration of belief systems.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linear progression follows riddle→journey→discovery formula with satisfying cause-effect. Pacing economizes within constraints but resolution feels abrupt; revelation lacks escalation. Footprint mechanism remains abstractly mystical rather than organically explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite eco-horror atmosphere through synesthetic mangrove details—briny smells, spectral harmonics. Spiritual sentience of setting deepens thematic resonance. Mangrove labyrinth transcends backdrop to become active narrative participant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "living memories" elevate material. Ending's sentient gratitude twist profound but underexplored. Tension between preservation and intrusion resonates. Subtext about necrotic curation lacks explicit confrontation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Archetypal quest narrative emerges with fresh setting-specific twists. Some phrases ("sought secrets of the universe") border on cliche. Emotional beats occasionally spelled out rather than embodied. Inventive spiritual ecology counters generic curiosity arc.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into atmospheric vignette more than structural triumph. Short form enhances mystique but sacrifices narrative momentum. Lingering questions about dream stewardship ethics suggest thematic potential marginally realized.</comment>
