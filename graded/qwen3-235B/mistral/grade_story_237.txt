<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength lies in Eamon's clear, layered motivation tied to both his profession and personal loss; however, the "proudly humble" attribute feels superficially contradictory rather than psychologically complex, occasionally undermining sincerity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rapid yet coherent progression from captivity to redemption; the diary decoding drives momentum, while the 400-word constraint leaves climactic pacing slightly rushed but emotionally resonant despite occasional narrative compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Contrast between grimy sci-fi setting and poetic metaphors (e.g., "last star fading") creates tension, but bullet trains in space lack ecological consistency, diluting immersion through incongruous anachronism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "alarm bells of heartbreak" and intergenerational fate threads evoke thematic depth; however, some emotional beats lean on stated feelings rather than purely immersive subtext or action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s with unique profession and hybrid genre blending, but repetitive use of "lengthen" and romanticized fate tropes borders on overwrought abstraction rather than earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesiveness emerges from tight thematic unity, though brevity forces compromise in developing secondary elements; the ending's philosophical shift feels earned but underfleshed, balancing ambition against constraints.</comment>
