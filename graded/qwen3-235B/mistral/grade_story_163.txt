<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Assigned traits (bitter optimism, lost heiress) are stated more than demonstrated; reactions to parking stub hint at motivation but lack psychological nuance. Character voice remains static despite pivotal discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plausible cause-effect (stub→code→files), but compressed arc feels rushed. Cloud migration framing device adds cyclical structure, though the climax-to-resolution transition skips emotional development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid visual details (cotton candy clouds, glass dome) immerse but occasionally prioritize style over function. Setting's scientific purpose rarely intersects with atmospheric elements beyond superficial contrast.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mixed use of symbolism: parking stub's duality works, but "cotton candy hues" leans cliché. Core theme of unification resonates intellectually but lacks visceral storytelling techniques to amplify emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on orphaned-genius trope. Descriptions occasionally lapse into overloaded metaphor ("river of cotton candy"). Emotional beats telegraphed rather than earned through character actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration uneven: parking stub central but "reckless precision" tone inconsistently applied. Thrilling conceptual core (xenobiology legacy) undermined by formulaic emotional arcs within tight structure.</comment>
