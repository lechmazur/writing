<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weakness in internal motivation coherence; traits like "heartbroken" are stated but not fully dramatized; inconsistent alignment of actions (suicide, reaper existence) with later healing arc</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Efficient character-driven arc within constraints; some rushed transitions (bird's seeds leading to manuscript lacks mechanical logic); resolution feels slightly abrupt</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details and mood; cave acoustics and manuscript materiality work well; "softly thunderous" concept under-developed as more than auditory descriptor</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of found manuscript as self-healing; cyclical structure between opening/closing natural imagery enhances thematic resonance; emotional impact lingers</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imaginative premise but derivative elements (bird as guide, cave of healing); avoids purple prose but occasionally relies on predictable emotional descriptors ("fearful joy")</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic integration of suffering/creation; brief length serves contemplative tone; some assigned elements (migrating bird method) feel semi-artificially imposed</comment>
