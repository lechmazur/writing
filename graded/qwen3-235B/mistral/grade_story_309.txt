<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has emotional depth but motivation shift feels underdeveloped; memories effectively reveal backstory but transitions lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear structure works within constraints but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between memories and resolve needs stronger linkage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere and sensory details (neon, rust) immerse reader; setting’s symbolic connection to character’s psyche is effective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (kaleidoscope/Queen of Hearts) elevate theme; pacing leans on introspection over action but retains emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar motifs (haunted detective, sentimental keepsakes); prose occasionally veers into ornate description without deeper purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but execution feels self-conscious; emotional impact is diluted by predictable arcs and sparse character detailing.</comment>
