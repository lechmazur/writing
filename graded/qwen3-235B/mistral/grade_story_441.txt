<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but underdeveloped; his motivations feel surface-level despite some symbolic coherence. Actions during the climax lack emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has structural clarity but relies on abrupt, unearned resolutions; the flash mob's causality and dissolution lack logical narrative scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is partially evocative (e.g., sterile hum, cold feet) but underdeveloped; setting and tone clash with certain plot beats, weakening immersion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blends niche elements (particle accelerator, foreign stamps) with familiar tropes; some originality in concept but execution strays into predictability and uneven tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</comment><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesion is mixed—some elements feel stitched together rather than organically integrated; the brief length works against thematic and character depth.</comment>
