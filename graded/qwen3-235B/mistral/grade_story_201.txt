<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Purpose-driven but lacks nuanced contradictions; emotional inheritance is central but character depth remains superficial beyond key traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within constraints; celestial tracking feels slightly contrived but maintains forward momentum. Resolved arcs are efficient but predictable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively but surface-level; constrained length is embraced rather than transfigured; lingering impact exists but lacks transcendence.</comment>
