<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marco’s contradiction between executioner role and love of dance is intriguing but lacks deeper psychological exploration; motivations for preserving dance via keychain are surface-level rather than tied to complex personal history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear structure works within constraints but pivotal moments (keychain, dance climax) feel underdeveloped; pacing unevenly compresses emotional beats, leaving resolution slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating studio and tides create vivid, cohesive atmosphere; festival prep and sensory details enhance immersion but cultural context of dance traditions remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance elevated by metaphors (tides as life’s fluidity) and Marco’s silent vow; ending slightly sentimental, but dancing keychain symbolism and subtext on hidden identities resonate memorably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but benign ferocity and familial pride risk feeling familiar; prose balances lyricism with restraint, though some descriptors (e.g., “soothing tides”) lean predictably on natural world for pathos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements (keychain, tides) are cleverly threaded into Marco’s internal conflict but occasionally feel checklist-driven; tone and setting unify the narrative, leaving lingering thematic weight on tradition vs. duty.</comment>
