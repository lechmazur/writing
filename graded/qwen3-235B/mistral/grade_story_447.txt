<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Edith's motivation to mend the community is clear and consistent, driving her transformation, but her voice and inner complexity remain underexplored, relying on clichéd traits of isolated truth-seekers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The unraveling of the toy’s bulletins effectively propels the plot, but the tight word limit leaves some narrative beats (e.g., townsfolk rallying) feeling abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (apple pie aroma, amber prison metaphor) enrich the setting, though the connection between Edith’s "amber prison" and her internal state lacks deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of the ear’s deterioration mirroring truth-revelation adds depth, but emotional resonance is undercut by moments of explicit emotional telling rather than nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The small-town setup and "amber prison" lean on familiar tropes; while the future bulletins are inventive, the overall execution lacks subversive freshness to fully escape predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates its elements, though some—like the pie and amber prison—feel more symbolic than functionally essential to the narrative’s emotional arc.</comment>
