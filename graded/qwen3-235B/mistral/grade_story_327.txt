<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters function as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance or development beyond their assigned narrative roles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc but relies on contrivance (road closure) to initiate action; resolution feels elegant yet underdeveloped within the restrictive word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly imagined but inconsistently applied; occasional sensory details immerse readers, yet the setting’s mystical qualities remain underexploited narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (index card as map, reflections as aspirations) elevate the narrative; emotional resonance is present but occasionally undercut by overly abstract prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in conceit (haggling with reality) contrasts with formulaic mentor/student dynamics; avoids overt clichés but sometimes veers into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven but prioritize metaphor over narrative depth; the story succeeds as a parable but lacks lingering visceral impact.</comment>
