<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Limited internal conflict, motivations stated more than demonstrated. The whispering advisor's role lacks specific advisory manifestations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Structure exists but resolution feels abrupt. Temporal decryption lacks concrete dramatization, narrative arc compressed through descriptive summary rather than plotted development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details about rusty fences and time-dilated hum create immersive tone, but temporal distortion mechanics remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in interconnected time webs, but emotional resonance constrained by abstract, essayistic conclusions rather than character-driven epiphanies.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original premise weakened by repetitive "oddly comforting" phrases, generic "whispering advisor" trope, and overly poetic abstractions that border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent thematic unity undermined by underdeveloped human elements. The constrained format works conceptually but restricts emotional payoff.</comment>
