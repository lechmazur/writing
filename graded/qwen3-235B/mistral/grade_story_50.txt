<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but occasionally rushed; cause-effect between decoding patterns and transformation is logical but underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (glass shimmer, piano echoes) immerse readers, though some atmospheric descriptions verge on ornamental rather than thematically essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (butterflies, fork) and thematic exploration of faith vs. magic, but emotional impact could be heightened through subtler execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids total formulaicity but leans on familiar motifs (desert pilgrimage, magical revelation); language occasionally becomes overly lush, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements fit together with ingenuity, though some forcefulness in their integration; tone remains consistent despite brevity, leaving a contemplative impression.</comment>
