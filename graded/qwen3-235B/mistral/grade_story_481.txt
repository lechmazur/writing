<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's perception is demonstrated but lacks depth in how his cartography expertise shapes his decisions; motivation stated more than demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed - the forge encounter lacks build-up, the dragonfly's significance isn't fully earned narratively, and resolution comes too conveniently despite atmospheric setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere has strong sensory contrast (sterile vs. forge) and edgy nostalgia is conveyed, but the futuristic hospital setting remains underutilized spatially; time frame device feels somewhat ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual framework (corruption of innocence, self-discovery) clear but delivered with mixed effectiveness; some "telling" about transformation rather than showing changed perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Contains fresh combinations but suffers from uneven prose - some evocative phrases ("distantly intimate relationship with the world") undercut by formulaic expressions ("journey was far from over").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves basic cohesion and conceptual resonance, but would benefit from more radical compression or expansion - the 500-word frame exposes underdeveloped connections between elements.</comment>
