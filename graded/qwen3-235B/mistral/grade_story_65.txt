<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character trait as slapdash bard insufficiently explored; motivation to escape death is clear but lacks psychological depth; reactions to the doorplate align with established grief but feel surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from tradition to discovery to journey, but the compressed structure rushes critical transitions; the ending connects to the beginning but lacks nuanced resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in describing the tectonic edge and melancholic atmosphere; integration of setting with theme is deliberate but underdeveloped beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (singing as defiance) and subtext (tradition as immortality); pacing constraints limit deeper exploration of emotional stakes despite resonant ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on quest narrative tropes; prose is purposeful but occasionally overwrought; emotional resonance relies on elegaical tone rather than unmediated showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Element integration is functional but uneven; some assigned elements (e.g., sacred spaces) feel underserved; the ending’s thematic closure is satisfying but slight within the brevity.</comment>
