<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; "zealous warrior" traits are asserted rather than demonstrated through specific actions; motivation feels abstract rather than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed but coherent; some plot developments feel expedited; the transformation from discovery to revolution is under-earned in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric setting with vivid metaphors ("waxing/waning star"), but sensory details remain generalized rather than visceral; the "cloud watching" timeframe isn't fully integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (nail as hidden potential, variable star as change), but emotional resonance is limited by abstract narration; the theme of spiritual/material duality needs more concrete dramatization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (oppressed people, symbolic relics) without subversion; occasionally overwritten ("battleground of conflicting beliefs") with insufficiently original metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Functional but unspectacular; elements are serviceable but not uniquely combined; concise execution lacks the depth to fully explore complex themes.</comment>
