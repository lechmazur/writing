<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character acts as a vehicle for plot rather than a fully realized entity; motivations are clear but underexplored; reactions lack psychological depth despite the "singularly multiple" attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a high-concept reveal, but pacing suffers from abrupt transitions; shoelace interlude disrupts momentum despite serving as a superficial tension-builder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create texture, but the perpetual motion workshop's thematic connection to plant-life remains underdeveloped; graceless beauty inconsistently embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery elevates the narrative, but lacks emotional transcendence; the ending's thematic payoff feels conceptually sound yet emotionally distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by formulaic transitions ("whispers of plants," "symphony of motion"); avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornamental prose without narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves narrative closure but struggles to balance poetic abstraction with emotional resonance; elements cohere conceptually but occasionally lack visceral impact.</comment>
