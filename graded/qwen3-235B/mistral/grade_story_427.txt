<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Élouan's mechanical arm and philosophical nature are integral to his identity, but motivations occasionally feel abstract rather than emotionally grounded. The visitor's desperation lacks nuanced complexity despite surface-level coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sock challenge drives the narrative, but pacing stumbles in balancing exposition with symbolic action. The ending feels abrupt, leaving the visitor's journey underexplored despite a clear narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (waves, mechanical hums) immerse readers in the lighthouse's desolate beauty. The setting and ticking-timeframe of "hush" intensify solitude, though timeframe connection to "applause" remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (sock as imbalance, arm as duality) resonate intellectually, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstraction. The ending's open-endedness invites reflection without achieving profound closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on poetic vagueness ("coded desperation") over visceral originality. The central metaphor of the sock feels purposeful but borders on contrived conceptualism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are skillfully woven but prioritize symbolism over human-scale emotional stakes. The story's brevity serves its thematic focus yet limits deeper connection with characters or world.</comment>
