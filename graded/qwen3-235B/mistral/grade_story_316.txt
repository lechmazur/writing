<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation (promise/collective healing) is consistent but lacks psychological depth; timidity is stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot relies on symbolic gestures (scoreboard visit, ribbon weaving) that lack logical connection to character growth; pacing is uneven, with rushed epiphany and underdeveloped cause-effect relationships.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere juxtaposes intriguing elements (ancient temple, factory ruin) but fails to integrate them into a cohesive reality; sensory details are sporadic and insufficient to ground the abstract themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elegant language carries thematic resonance ("tapestry of stories") but falls into excessive metaphorical abstraction; emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on declarative statements about healing rather than immersive showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Blends original settings but often defaults to romanticized clich√©s ("seraphic," "reimagined") without subverting expectations; transitions (e.g., temple to arcade) feel algorithmically generated rather than organically motivated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story structure holds through thematic ambition but suffers from inconsistent element integration; the juxtaposition of sacred and industrial could be richer, and emotional core feels aspirational rather than deeply earned.</comment>
