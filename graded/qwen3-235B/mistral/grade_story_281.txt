<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Thaddeus’ motivation shift feels underdeveloped; his defiance lacks psychological nuance. The dummy’s antagonism drives him, but his internal logic remains schematic. The “soul vs breath” resolution feels imposed, not earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing strains within 500 words: transformation arc collapses too quickly. The dummy’s poem feels mechanical, disrupting momentum. The resolution hinges on abstract dialogue rather than narrative progression, leaving coherence strained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually potent setting—oilcans, rust, portholes—evokes decay. Sensory details (metal walls, winter-breeze voice) amplify unease. The “confusingly lucid” air is intriguing but underexploited; atmosphere outpaces thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Verses add memorability, but the “transformation” theme lacks subtext. Dialogue contrasts sharp/dull rather than evoking layered tension. The ending’s “soul vs breath” message feels declarative, not organic. Strong style, weak emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on haunted-dummy tropes and predictable redemption arcs. The dummy’s “shifting expressions” and “scorching poise” lean on clichéd phrasing. Overuse of portentous adjectives/adverbs (“hollow, in the hold”) weakens originality. Tension between literal/metaphorical sustenance feels derivative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack alchemy: the timeframe (“between appointments”) feels tacked on, dummy’s purpose underexplored. The brevity works for atmosphere but not character depth. Ending suggests thematic ambition but executes superficially.</comment>
