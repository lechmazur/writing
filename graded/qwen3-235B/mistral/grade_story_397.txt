<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's jadedness informs his obsession with the past, but his character remains superficial—motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth or evolution. The scalpel and doodles serve more as plot devices than extensions of his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical, but the tight word limit forces rushed transitions (e.g., lab work to revelation). The beginning/end connection works, but the climax feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (stillness vs. fireworks) but underutilizes sensory details. The laboratory’s "strange energy" hints at potential unmet. Timeframe/setting complement tension but don’t deepen the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective imagery and metaphor (crystals as data, fireworks as countdown), but emotional resonance is surface-level. The ending is intriguing but lacks thematic pay-off beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but the scientist-with-wild-hair trope and "data-encoded-in-crystals" concept lean on speculative conventions. Language is mostly crisp but occasionally overwritten (“genuinely strange miracle”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indispensable—the bartender’s profession, precise doodle method, and “globalize” imperative feel loosely integrated. The story’s intrigue lies in concept, not cohesive execution.</comment>
