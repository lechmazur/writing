<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but somewhat cliched; transformation from kingpin to community leader feels abrupt despite actions aligning with established traits. Nuanced internal conflict underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression with clear structural arc, but relies on contrived detour as pivotal plot device. Pacing manages to avoid feeling rushed despite word constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story avoids obvious formulaic traps but falls into redemption-arc predictability. Some overused phrases ("tyranny of indifference") weaken otherwise purposeful prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but create an overly symmetrical narrative that sacrifices complexity for closure. Length limitations expose structural simplifications that prevent deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
