<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; softheartedness isn't deeply demonstrated through nuanced actions. Motivation tied to cosmic purpose feels underexplored despite the belt buckle's symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels condensed; the connection between belt buckle and constellation lacks gradual buildup. Cause-effect logic holds but resolution feels abstract rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid neon-drenched setting contrasts with the planetarium's decay. Sensory details (bioluminescent ink, rust) effective, but "ancient ethics vs. tech" theme remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors like "celestial ballet" add depth, but emotional resonance relies on abstractions ("muted euphoria") rather than visceral showing. Theme of bridging past/future feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines cyberpunk with cosmic mysticism, but the "hero's journey" framework feels familiar. Some overly ornate phrasing ("cybernetic jungle") weakens impact; emotional nuance lacks specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a atmospheric whole but lack cohesive thematic precision. The brevity works against deeper character/philosophical exploration, feeling more constrained than purposeful.</comment>
