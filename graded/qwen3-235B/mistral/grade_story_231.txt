<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Poor motivation development; sentimental aspect underutilized, spontaneity inconsistently demonstrated, hairpin symbolism insufficiently integrated into character psychology or actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mechanical plot progression dictated by checklist elements; arbitrary cause-effect (coordinates leading directly to climax), compressed arc lacking organic tension or payoff within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sumerian palace reduced to vague "ancient" tropes; sparse sensory engagement beyond visual descriptors, atmosphere fails to meaningfully interact with thematic/character concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Surface-level treatment of abstract themes; clumsy symbolic use of hairpin/chaos, ending lacks emotional/philosophical impact, inconsistent application of "chaotic humility" tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on genre clich√©s (cloaked figures, prophetic summons) with minimal subversion; stilted metaphors ("anchor lifted for maiden voyage"), character psychology feels algorithmically generated rather than authentically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element checklist approach undermines cohesion; forced integration of Sumerian setting/timeframe metaphor, thematic elements superficially graze ideas without substantive exploration.</comment>
