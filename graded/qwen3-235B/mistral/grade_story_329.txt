<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Inert character; traits stated but not embodied. Chess grandmaster lacks strategic depth or unique voice. Motivation (mystery-chasing) feels arbitrary rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot chases its own tail. The "hidden passage" quest lacks stakes. Sudden escape from locals feels unearned due to underdeveloped tension. Fragmented pacing within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unrealized atmospheric potential. Sensory details (confetti, mist) float disconnected from character experience. Hydroponic farm's alien qualities underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor (chess/mystery) occasionally surfaces, but emotional engagement remains superficial. Ending avoids resolution but offers no compensating thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mixed originality. Hydroponic noodles vs. chess grandmaster combine inventively, but tropes (suspicious locals, puzzle quests) feel algorithmically recycled. Purple prose ("agonizing bliss") mars clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't synergize. Short form exposes structural weaknesses. Style oscillates between atmospheric yearning and narrative indecision.</comment>
