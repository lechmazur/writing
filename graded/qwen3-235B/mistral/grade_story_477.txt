<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weak integration of 'mindfully scattered' and underdeveloped emotional stakes; swordsmanship symbolism feels superficial rather than intrinsic to character choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinge on cosmic signal shift lacks buildup, making destruction of AquaScope feel abrupt; pacing strains coherence within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through sparse but vivid imagery (crumbling kelp/swaying bird songs) undermined by inconsistent sensory grounding in underwater logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concept-driven cohesion undermined by forced element integration (bird songs) and truncated thematic exploration; promising fragments lack polish.</comment>
