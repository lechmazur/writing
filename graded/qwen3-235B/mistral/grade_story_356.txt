<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are sketched superficially; motivation to "hush 'what if'" lacks visceral emotional grounding, making abrupt vanishing feel unearned despite poetic descriptions of time.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on arbitrary vanishing without causal logic; cloud-drawing action is symbolic but disconnected from structured narrative progression, though constrained word count manages a melancholic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cargo hold's textured details create vivid atmosphere, but setting functions more as backdrop than active force shaping Eli's metaphysical journey, weakening thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sparse symbolism (clouds/time) and quiet epiphany about acceptance show craft, but emotional impact remains muted through underdeveloped stakes; ending satisfies on abstract level rather than human one.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into lyrical vagueness ("gentle harshness") rather than precise innovation; vanishing concept feels mystical yet derivative of existential parables.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack gravitational pull toward a unified vision; concise format serves mood over narrative substance, leaving thematic echoes without narrative urgency.</comment>
