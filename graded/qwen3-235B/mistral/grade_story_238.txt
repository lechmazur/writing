<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Edgar's gloominess is well-established, but "abrasively charming" is underexplored; his determination to reclaim light feels narratively imposed rather than organically earned through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is linear but lacks narrative tension; resolution feels abrupt despite clear beginning-to-end linkage, with word constraints compromising pacing nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie carnival atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory decay ("rusted Ferris wheel," "cold metal" of the payphone), though some descriptions verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors ("light stolen by midnight") hint at subtext but lean on lyrical abstraction over emotional specificity; ending resolves too neatly for the story's haunting tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (melancholic custodian, sentient machines); some phrasing feels formulaic ("mechanical vulture"), while the wallet-as-memory device lacks fresh contextualization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper narrative synergy; brevity feels restrictive, with thematic potential (transience, memory) only partially realized.</comment>
