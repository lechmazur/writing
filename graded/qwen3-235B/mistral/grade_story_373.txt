<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's cybernetic traits inform actions but could more explicitly shape personality; motivation of "devouring a taboo" is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with "distorting perceptions" driving narrative; pacing is tight but resolution feels slightly rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic coral and eerie quiet create vivid immersion; the train whistle's echo feels incongruous but enhances atmospheric tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise weakened by occasional generic descriptors ("liquid rainbows") and formulaic phrases; maintains tone but lacks subtext in places.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with some forced inclusions (train whistle); ending lingers thematically despite minor structural unevenness.</comment>
