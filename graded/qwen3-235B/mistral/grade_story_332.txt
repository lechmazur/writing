<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character consistently gentle yet conflicted, but motivations lack psychological depth; actions align with traits but lack complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc but relies on abrupt resuscitation; pacing condenses narrative well while slightly undercutting emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting's zero-gravity streams and ethereal blooms evoke mood but lack tangible sensory texture and integration with character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (origami boat as hope) enhance theme, but ending leans on sentimental resolution rather than earned emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by intermittently ornate phrasing ("spaces between borrowed books") and predictable emotional beats in revival.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cohesive but derivative in its "art transcends death" message; brevity serves premise but leaves thematic layers underexplored.</comment>
