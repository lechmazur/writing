<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Monty's motivation as a former child star seeking "wild magic" drives his actions, but his eccentricity feels more like a surface trait than a deeply integrated personality force; his voice is distinct in reflections but lacks nuanced contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on compressed time ("days deciphering") without showing pivotal moments; cause/effect (map → obsession → revelation) is logical, but pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, tech-tinged Hollywood decay is vividly realized; atmosphere supports themes through sensory details like the chamber's "heartbeat" and cathedral window's light, though some descriptions verge on ornate.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor (empty bottle as irony of ambition); ending resonates thematically, but emotional stakes lack fuller exploration through character actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids extreme tropes (mad genius) with fresh elements (vibration chamber, etched glass), but the "empty treasure" twist is somewhat predictable; prose is purposeful but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements like the mansion and map are tightly woven into character and plot; chamber and timeframe feel slightly extraneous; ending lingers but lacks deeper ambiguity.</comment>
