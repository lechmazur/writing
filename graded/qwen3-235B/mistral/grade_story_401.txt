<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation (reconciliation) is clear, but wilderness guide trait isn't fully utilized to deepen personality or methods. Emotional progression is coherent but lacks distinctiveness in voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc within constraints; pacing works but decoding process feels somewhat compressed. Connection between grandmother's past and Eli's resolution is logical but lacks intermediate tension development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes haunting beauty through sparse details (sunken ship, bitter coffee), but setting remains decorative rather than integral. The pirate ship's symbolism feels underexplored as a metaphor for buried truths.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of blanket/ring and themes of intergenerational trauma elevate impact. Ending achieves emotional resonance through tactile details rather than abstract statements, though depth of nuance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but shows minor AI tendencies: repetitive descriptors ("manic clarity"), overly precise sensory details. Concept is inventive but execution occasionally drifts toward melodrama (encoded yarn diaries).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements with minor friction. Length is effective but some underdeveloped aspects (setting-plot connection) suggest constraints. Leaves thematic questions but lacks haunting persistence in final impression.</comment>
