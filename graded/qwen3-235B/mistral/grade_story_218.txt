<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Edgar’s transition from isolation to connection is emotionally resonant but lacks gradual nuance, making his motivation feel slightly surface-level. The "shadowboxing with demons" concept is hinted at but underexplored narratively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc, but the pivotal shift to joining the troupe occurs too abruptly. Pacing is uneven—Edgar’s internal transformation feels rushed despite the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric contrast between the decayed clock tower and vibrant theatre enhances mood. Strong visual details dominate, though other senses are underutilized. The setting meaningfully mirrors Edgar’s internal journey.</comment>
