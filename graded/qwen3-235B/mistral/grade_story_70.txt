<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's uptight nature is evident but lacks depth; transformation feels abrupt without nuanced emotional beats. Motivation to build the bulb is clear but undershows how being "certainly uncertain" drives actions beyond surface-level curiosity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence and a clear arc but feels rushed; pivotal moments (storms, failures) are underdeveloped. Cause-and-effect is logical, but pacing within the word limit sacrifices emotional resonance during the climax and transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and thematically resonant—graveyard-adjacent greenhouse mirrors emotional decay and rebirth. Sensory details (e.g., stardust adhesive, glowing filament) immerse readers and enhance the tone of quiet metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes a contemplative mood through symbolism (light as empathy, puzzle as self-discovery). Ending is poignant but slightly over-explains emotions; themes of transformation and buried optimism resonate but lack layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story avoids clichés in setting but leans on predictable arcs (lonely character finds purpose). Some metaphors are original, but emotional beats are "told" rather than shown (e.g., "cradling empathy"). Language is vivid but occasionally veers into ornate description without purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is uneven; elements like the adhesive analysis and "arms of steel" feel loosely integrated. The brief length constrains depth, though the witch’s greenhouse and bulb anchor the narrative. Leaves a lingering image (lit bulb) but lacks thematic ambition.</comment>
