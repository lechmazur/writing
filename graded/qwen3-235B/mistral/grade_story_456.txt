<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization is abstract and impressionistic rather than deeply rendered; Elias' transformation feels more conceptual than emotionally grounded. His "neutrally passionate" trait influences passive observation more than active motivation, though the candle visions do align with his latent curiosity. Voice remains stylistically consistent but not distinctively individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear visionary structure (discovery->ritual->revelation->resolution) that works within the constraint. Pacing feels slightly compressed, particularly the shift from curiosity to cosmic realization. The candle as driver of action provides necessary momentum, though the cause-effect chain lacks nuanced psychological gradients for the character's conversion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through visceral sensory details ("spectral fingers," "whisper secrets") and tonal coherence between floating dojo and cosmic motifs. However, worldbuilding feels intentionally sparse; the "rock" quality of the dojo and connection to floating physics remain underexploited narrative resources despite supporting the mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphoric scaffolding (candle as life-death cycle, flora as microcosm) elevates thematic resonance. The ending avoids schmaltz through restrained language, though some abstractions ("newfound purpose") lean toward telling rather than showing. Central conflict between isolation and cosmic connection emerges clearly yet remains surface-level in its exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structure but contains faint traces of AI-writing cadences in transitional phrases ("As the wick caught fire...", "He saw..."). Sensory details feel deliberate rather than generic, though several thematic elements (timid boldness, tempered beliefs) border on conceptual stating rather than organic embodiment. Maintains stylistic cohesion but lacks daring sentence-level innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in narrative functionâ€”the candle serves as master key while the writer's trunk feels contrived. Language quality supports immersive focus, and the brief form feels intentional, yet the story leans more on poetic suggestion than concrete dramatic action to provoke lasting resonance.</comment>
