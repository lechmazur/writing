<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Past-tense exposition dominates motivation; reactions to objects feel illustrative rather than transformative. Vigilante's "subdued" aspect remains surface descriptor rather than behavioral pattern.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mirror's revelation initiates action but lacks sequential stakes; compressed structure maintains coherence through recurring symbol rather than narrative payoff. Resolution feels truncated but conceptually aligned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Anaphoric decay clich√©s ("cracked marble," "dust-laden") offer no fresh perspective on abandonment; atmosphere collapses under weight of unearned emotional freight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Mirror's distortion becomes potent symbol of moral obfuscation; "screaming silence" juxtaposition creates lingering tension between presence/absence of justice. Subtext of war's lingering trauma resonates through environmental metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Vigilante paradigm subverted by methodical, nonviolent tracking; wooden bead's simplicity contrasts with magical realism elements. Avoids noir tropes through Eli's introspective restraint and economic metaphors of corruption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Required elements cohere superficially; mirror's mechanics undermine thematic unity. Compressed form feels restrictive rather than intentional; emotional arc remains nascent.</comment>
