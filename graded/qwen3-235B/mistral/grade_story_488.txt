<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (outshining reflection) drives action, but underdeveloped interiority limits emotional depth; "solitary summoner" trait remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure efficient but rushed, particularly device creation; cause-effect clarity maintained despite tight constraints, though climax lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Quantum beach's evocative potential undercut by inconsistent sensory anchoring; corroded rapture tone occasionally powerful but unevenly sustained through final paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mixed success with literary devices: lantern's refraction as symbolic triumph works, but themes stated overtly rather than revealed through subtext; ending satisfies mechanically rather than emotionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Predictable emotional arcs (self-doubt â†’ triumph) and occasionally inflated prose ("corroded rapture," "innate magic") weaken authenticity; quantum beach concept shows ingenuity but insufficiently interrogated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent execution of assigned elements with minor thematic resonance; polished but lacks distinctive authorial voice or revelatory synthesis of components to distinguish as prestige-level.</comment>
