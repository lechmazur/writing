<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (justify existence) but underdeveloped; connection between "dog walker for the ultra-rich" and core conflicts feels superficial. Character voice lacks distinctiveness despite third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a predictable arc (character enters mansion, confronts ghost, emerges transformed). The dare at the blood drive feels tacked on rather than organically driving the narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (e.g., "loud silence," wilting plants) enhance the haunted-mansion trope. Timeframe integration ("color bleeds") is effective but underexploited for deeper thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (plants as trapped existence) are conceptually sound but emotionally flat. The ending's catharsis feels abrupt rather than earned. Dialogue is minimal but impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (haunted mansion, ghost seeking closure) with minimal subversion. "Botanical collection" and "silent agreements" add specificity but lack layered integration with character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses assigned elements but often superficially. The blood drive dare and "carefully careless" rhythm particularly strain cohesion. Atmosphere and emotional beats suggest potential but uneven execution.</comment>
