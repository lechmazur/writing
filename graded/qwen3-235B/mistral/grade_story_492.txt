<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mentions of Elijah's traits are superficial; actions don't deeply reveal character. Motivation stated but not psychologically explored. Voice lacks distinctiveness. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear progression from problem to resolution, but pacing uneven. Some leaps in plot (e.g. corporate enforcers) feel rushed. Concept ties to ending but lacks build-up. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong initial sensory details that create mood, but setting elements (escalator, alley) aren't fully integrated into plot mechanics. Atmosphere supports tone but doesn't deepen theme. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors ("digital labyrinth") and surface-level emotional impact, but lacks subtextual layers. Ending feels abrupt rather than resonant. Shows rather than tells sparingly. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Combines cyberpunk tropes with analog hacking twist, but "reluctant catalyst" remains underexplored. Avoids clich√©s in concept but slips into familiar revolutionary narrative. Language occasionally over-embellished. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly weighted; some feel checklist-driven (escalator's standstill). Brief length works against deeper exploration but maintains surface cohesion. </comment>
