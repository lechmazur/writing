<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lira's guilt and motivation are clear but superficially developed. Her reserved boldness appears in action but lacks nuanced reactions. The mask's significance is established, but emotional depth and backstory remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear plot progression driven by the mask's clues. Connection between rosebush timing and journey is logical. Pacing is efficient but feels rushed in critical moments. The ending fulfills structure but lacks emotional payoff, creating a sense of narrative incompleteness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid neon-and-steel imagery creates atmospheric immersion. Sensory details (buzzing signs, shifting carvings) enhance mood. Setting supports tone but relies on cyberpunk/dystopian tropes without distinctive elaboration, limiting deeper worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of mask/door as redemption metaphor has potential. Writing employs visual metaphors effectively but lacks subtext. Ending maintains mystery but feels abrupt rather than thought-provoking. Theme of release/redemption remains underdeveloped despite clear structural messaging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on genre conventions (questing warrior, mystical artifacts) without subversion. Descriptions avoid ornamentation but lack specificity for true originality. Plot mechanics feel purposeful yet familiar, with resolution following predictable narrative patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively integrated into plot framework. Brief format allows concise execution but limits thematic expansion. Creative combinations (neon repair shop historians, petal-determined timing) add uniqueness but lack transformative impact on narrative depth.</comment>
