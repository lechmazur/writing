<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Flightiness as an attribute remains largely unexplored in action or speech; motivation for legacy is clear but inconsistently tied to deeper character flaws or virtues. The grease-stained overalls as a memento feel tangential rather than integral to his personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (initiation → revelation → acceptance) but relies on functional pacing rather than dramatic tension. The action to "linearize" through paintings drives the narrative, though the resolution feels abrupt and lacking push-pull conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The initiation hall’s grandeur and "fractured guilds" setting are evocatively hinted at but lack visceral sensory details beyond sight/sound. The "flicker of unity" tone contrasts with Eamon’s "serene anger" without fully harmonizing. Atmosphere is serviceable but not immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves emotional resonance through the metaphor of mapping as legacy, though relies heavily on stated themes ("unity," "chaos") rather than subtext. The ending feels satisfying but predictable; dialogue is sparse yet purposeful. Central conflict of validating his work lacks nuanced stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but treads familiar ground (secret societies, misunderstood genius). Sensory details are occasionally generic ("crumbling walls"), though the method of decoding paintings offers mild originality. Nuanced emotion is partially undercut by didactic lines like "serene anger."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Element integration feels calculated rather than organic; the mechanic’s patch and "serene anger" strain plausibility. The brevity is effective but doesn’t transcend format constraints. The theme of legacy through order is clear but lacks provocative depth.</comment>
