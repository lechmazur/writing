<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like 'sweetly confrontational' are referenced but underdemonstrated; motivations tied to 'strategy' feel abstract rather than embodied through specific actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., hive collapse) that lack sufficient causal buildup; pacing struggles to balance cosmic intrigue and intimate consequences within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes cosmic grandeur and beekeeping intimacy but lacks immersive sensory detail; the quasar deck’s functionality and its relationship to the bees remain underexplored, weakening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphors (stars as snow, brass cups as mixed blessings) and thematic subtext about balance, but the resolution feels overly tidy, diluting emotional complexity in favor of tidy closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through eccentric combinations (beekeeping + quasars), but some phrasing ('star-snow,' 'celestial beasts') verges on excessive poeticism; emotional stakes are hinted at rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack tight synergy—the 'animal tracks in snow' motif and quasar setting feel conceptually separate; originality shines but is undercut by narrative and thematic gaps that hinder cumulative impact.</comment>
