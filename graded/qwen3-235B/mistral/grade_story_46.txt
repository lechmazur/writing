<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's blank face lacks meaningful connection to traits/actions; motivations are clear but psychologically underdeveloped; actions align with stated goals but lack deeper emotional resonance; minimal distinct voice due to third-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence within word limit with clear beginning/middle/end; lunar arc provides narrative spine but lacks complex cause-effect beyond superficial approval mechanism; pacing balanced but lacks tension variation; assigned elements shape structure but don't drive innovation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting creates atmosphere but lacks functional integration with plot; sensory details (silver waterfalls, fern whispers) evoke mood but rarely enhance character motivation or thematic weight; aesthetic connections to dreamscape exist but feel decorative rather than essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (piano as dream conduit) and consistent tone present; lacks layered subtext or thematic depth; resolution feels emotionally satisfying in miniature but doesn't provoke deeper philosophical engagement; competent execution without groundbreaking technique.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (dream approval bureaucracy) and familiar tropes (solitary mystical guardian); avoids overt clich√©s but contains purple prose in nature descriptions; emotional resonance partially achieved through motif repetition rather than nuanced character interiority; stylistic consistency maintained without distinctive authorial fingerprint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohesively present but unevenly weighted; plastic ring and rumor-guardian role demonstrate strongest integration; setting/atmosphere feel conceptually separable; competent synthesis shows creativity in premise but not in structural or thematic innovation within constrained format.</comment>
