<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Victoria's dutiful nature shapes her actions, but her internal conflict between eagerness and jadedness lacks depth. Cyril's motivation is revealed but feels underexplored, with emotional beats rushed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc via voice notes leading to resolution. Logical progression weakened slightly by abrupt prop room discovery; pacing mostly effective within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary contrasts city noise, enhancing atmosphere. Sensory details (echoes, dust) evoke mood but occasionally generic. Timeframe "throughout auditions" is underutilized in narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of mortality and legacy resonate through Cyril's messages. Well-crafted metaphors (e.g., laughter reanimating the theater) enhance impact, but subtext remains surface-level rather than deeply provoked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains minor flowery phrasing ("soundless sanctuary"). Emotional nuance in Victoria’s perspective is occasionally explicit rather than shown. Character motivations feel human, if streamlined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</comment><grade><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements interlock cohesively, especially glove/voice notes leading to resolution. Worthy of publication but lacks transcendence; minor looseness in timeframe integration.</comment>
