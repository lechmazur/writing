<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (protecting butterflies) is clear but insufficiently grounded in his "unjustly fair" trait; actions (espionage, activism) don't naturally flow from apothecary skills; underdeveloped personal stakes beyond surface-level "unconventional love"</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plotted efficiently within word limit, but butterfly exploitation revelation feels rushed; abrupt shift from chart anomalies to global diplomacy; cause-effect logic strained by Elijah's sudden influence on warring factions</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich steampunk mechanics (valves, brass) contrast well with ethereal butterflies; atmospheric details (oily metal vs. wings) establish setting but lack visceral sensory immersion; "battered marvel" tone inconsistently maintained</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolism of butterflies as freedom resonates, though overwritten parallels between insects and treaties feel forced; ending lacks emotional payoffâ€”world-changing impact feels unearned; effective showing in early observational routines</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine avoids total cliche through specific machinery descriptions but relies on established genre tropes; butterfly-as-code concept is inventive but execution leans on predictable "nature vs. war" binaries; prose occasionally bogs down in ornamental alliteration ("clanking heart")</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively build premise but strain in higher-order synthesis; conceptually bold (butterfly espionage) yet structurally lightweight; tight word count prioritizes plot beats over thematic depth; memorable hook without sustained literary impact</comment>
