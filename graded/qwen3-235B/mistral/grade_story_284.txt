<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like stoicism and "pompous humility" are stated rather than deeply shown, with motivations for emotional transformation feeling underexplored. Dialogue lacks distinctiveness, though the final tender moment adds depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear plot is coherent but slightly rushed; the paper plane's revelation initiates action efficiently, while the swift emotional arc feels inevitable rather than earned. Pacing balances brevity and completeness, albeit with thin cause-and-effect development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visual and auditory details (bees, distant band) create mood but lack visceral specificity. The beekeeper's sanctuary is underutilized thematically; Amelia's cottage remains a blank vessel for romance. Atmosphere hints at connection but needs sharper anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Paper plane as metaphor for fragile dreams is effective, but emotional gravity leans on poetic turns ("untamed sincerity") rather than subtext. Ending resonates faintly, though the central conflict—stoicism vs. openness—is resolved too tidily. Dialogue is functional but not piercingly original.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing ("hum of the bees," "whisper") and idealized resolution (immediate softening of stoic character) suggest sentimental convention over innovation. Some sensory details and the beekeeper setting flirt with specificity but lack distinctive grit.</comment>
