<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Edmund's motivation to retrieve forgotten songs is clear and drives his actions, but his character lacks emotional depth and nuance beyond archetypal eccentricity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure is coherent with a cyclical arc, but pacing feels rushed in key moments (e.g., clients’ persuasion) and relies on compression rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The floating tea platform’s potential as a vivid, immersive setting is underutilized; recycled metaphors and static bottles lack visceral sensory detail or deeper symbolic integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is cohesive and conceptually striking but lacks the layered emotional impact, linguistic precision, and narrative urgency required for elite-tier publishability.</comment>
