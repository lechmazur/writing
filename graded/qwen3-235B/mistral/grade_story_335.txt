<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Surface-level traits of "shaky mercenary" and "carefully reckless" inform physical descriptions but lack psychological depth; motivation to "make peace" stated but underexplored through action or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear progression from rumor to discovery lacks narrative tension; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic bookending; cause-effect clear but predictable within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile descriptions of cathedral's art and amber create immersive atmosphere; time-specific shadows and textures enhance mood but underutilize symbolic potential of sacred space-turned-urban canvas.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (web of fate, amber as "stilled time") and lyrical prose elevate theme; emotional catharsis implied through sensory closure but lacks visceral impact; ending resonates faintly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding leans on familiar dystopian-artistic decay tropes; amber/spider concept borders on mystical clich√©; occasional purple prose ("echo of a prayer") undermines subtlety; pacing avoids formulaicity but lacks distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competently constructed but derivative; elements cohere without revelation; brevity serves plot cleanly but sacrifices thematic complexity; memorable only for atmospheric polish.</comment>
