<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Wei's rationally impulsive nature is stated but lacks demonstration through concrete choices; motivation feels abstract rather than organically tied to his actions. Emotional honesty as a driving force remains superficially explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overly compressed narrative prioritizes poetic imagery over plot progression; cold-case investigation feels implied rather than dramatized. The cyclical structure (palace as stage) works conceptually but lacks satisfying resolution or surprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through precise decay imagery ("dust settled like second skin") and effective contrasts between ruin and fragile hope. The "anxious serenity" tone is inconsistently sustained, occasionally lapsing into vague melancholy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mix of striking metaphors ("sunlight as spotlight") and overly general themes dilutes impact. Attempts at symbolic depth (doll's dress, collapsing society) are undercut by didactic exposition rather than organic revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on decay tropes and dramatic irony ("stage actor solving mysteries") betray algorithmic pattern recognition. Sensory details veer between specificity and vagueness; emotional honesty concept feels imported rather than earned through tangible conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Story functions as poetic exercise rather than cohesive narrative; assigned elements feel more like checklist fulfillment than organic components. Conceptual ambition outweighs emotional or structural execution.</comment>
