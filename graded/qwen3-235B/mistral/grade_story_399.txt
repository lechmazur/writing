<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's anguish is present but underdeveloped; transformation feels abrupt without specific memories anchoring his motivation. Grumpy trait lacks nuance beyond surface descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc is complete but paced unevenly; beginning and end connect thematically, though the catalytic revelation feels rushed without sufficient buildup for emotional gravity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich celestial imagery creates mystical atmosphere; sensory details evoke setting but occasionally veer into generic descriptions ("kaleidoscopic patterns") that could be more vivid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (mandala/tragedy) conveys theme effectively; ending resonates but relies on abstract statements rather than fully embodied character transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some overwrought metaphors ("multiply singular existence") and predictable redemption arc undercut originality; emotional resonance partially buried under lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically consistent whole but lack visceral urgency and deeper complexity needed to elevate beyond competent execution.</comment>
