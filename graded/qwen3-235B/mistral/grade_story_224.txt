<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent depth in exploring Eli's contradictory "openly private" nature; motivation and wish fulfillment lack emotional nuance beyond surface archetypes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional integration of elements; most serve plot but lack synergistic depth; brief length highlights structural seams rather than enhancing focus.</comment>
