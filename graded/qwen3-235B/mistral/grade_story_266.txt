<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's bleakness is consistent but lacks nuanced emotional layers; motivation to outshine lights is clear though poetic resolution feels underexplored. Actions align with traits but lack interpersonal depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc from isolation to quiet resolution; method of poetry feels purposeful but underdeveloped. Pacing is efficient yet slightly rushed in emotional progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting creates stark visual contrast that mirrors internal conflict; floating studio and icy landscape evoke psychological desolation. Sensory details effectively immerse reader without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of clock and aurora; ending provides thematic closure. Emotional resonance is present but occasionally undercut by explicit explanations rather than subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through unconventional pairings (floating yoga studio, jagged generosity). Emotional states are shown rather than told, with minimal purple prose and consistent tonal integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>All elements function cohesively but some (studio, timeframe) feel conceptually decorative. Length used effectively for thematic focus rather than structural limitation.</comment>
