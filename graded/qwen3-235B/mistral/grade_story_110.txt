<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery occasionally veers into overwrought descriptors ("quietly flamboyant"); premise subverts assassin tropes but leans on familiar "masterpiece murder" clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesive but unevenly weighted; brevity amplifies atmosphere but limits emotional payoff, particularly in character relationships.</comment>
