<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias's eccentricity is surface-level; motivations regarding leadership and fate are present but lack deeper nuance. The secret handshake manual feels underdeveloped beyond symbolism. Character-driven metaphors align with traits but lack layered complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through pruning and hidden tasks, but cause-effect links feel episodic. Ending resolves Elias's doubt effectively, though central conflict remains diffuse. Pacing is serviceable but lacks dynamism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Urban orchard/solar panels setting offers visual contrast but insufficient sensory immersion. Bittersweet tone emerges late; atmospheric potential underutilized despite evocative setup.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pruning metaphor for destiny is effective, but emotional resonance is mild. Theme of self-determination lacks depth. Ending provides closure but lacks lingering impact. Literary devices used conventionally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some clich√©s (eccentric leader trope) tempered by unique elements like solar panels and disclaimers. Metaphors function but occasionally verge on abstraction. Avoids outright formulaicity but lacks groundbreaking subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ambitious integration of elements is evident, but cohesion feels strained at times. Tone shifts unevenly; brief length exposes structural gaps. Offers thought-provoking concepts but insufficiently fleshed-out execution.</comment>
