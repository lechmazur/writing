<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Edgar’s confidence as a watchman is evident early but falters in his abrupt desertion; his artistic yearning drives the narrative but lacks nuanced internal conflict. The "forcibly gentle" attribute is underexplored in his actions, though his artistry reveals depth. Consistency wavers but resolves satisfyingly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed. The fingerprint map as a plot device lacks logical setup, making it feel contrived. Resolution is rushed, undercutting emotional weight. Pacing struggles with balancing backstory and climax in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hive’s sensory details (honey scent, humming) create vivid atmosphere. The microscopic fingerprint and ruler’s flaws enhance setting, but the vast field of flowers lacks specificity. Atmosphere supports tone but occasionally veers into generic whimsy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (ruler, fingerprint) and subtext about yearning resonate, but ending’s abrupt transformation feels unsatisfying. The theme of exploration is clear but lacks subtextual complexity. Emotional impact is dulled by overt narration over show-don’t-tell.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>“Jubilant remorse” repetition and “echo of yearning” phrasing lean into cliché. The bee-artist trope is predictable; microscope use strains realism. Metaphors are occasionally fresh but undercut by overly ornate, inconsistent sensory details and logical gaps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce but lack cohesion. Some creative integration (ruler, envy as motivation), but the narrative feels constrained by its checklist structure. Fingerprint method and timeframe weaken overall flow; the ending lacks lasting resonance.</comment>
