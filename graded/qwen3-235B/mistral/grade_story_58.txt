<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s loyalty and meditation motivation exist but lack depth; scout identity doesn’t sufficiently shape actions, and emotional logic feels underdeveloped. Metaphorical radicalization lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on abrupt tonal shifts (storm/comedy) and underexplained cause-effect; pacing rushes key realizations, straining coherence within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting and "sanctified dread" tone are inconsistently rendered; moths and outage lack sensory specificity and fail to organically deepen theme or atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of balance/stillness are conceptually present but executed through clichéd metaphors and "telling" over "showing"; comedic radicalization is inventive but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic writing but stumbles with occasional vagueness (e.g., "coded nonsense") and slightly forced contrasts; prose remains mostly purposeful despite uneven emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements like the radio routine and scout identity strain cohesion; while brevity allows thematic focus, artificial integration of assignments weakens overall impact.</comment>
