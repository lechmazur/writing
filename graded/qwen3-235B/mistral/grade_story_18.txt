<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lack of significant inner conflict or growth undermines otherwise clear motivations; character reactions align with traits but lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels compressed; cause-effect between recognition scene and resolution lacks narrative heft within limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid but derivative steampunk atmosphere relies heavily on fog/engine clich√©s; insufficient exploration of environmental impact on character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Symbolism present but surface-level (hair tie, verdigris); emotional beats told rather than shown through concrete action or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on steampunk/telepathy tropes without innovation; "flow like ink" metaphor never pays off narratively; emotional descriptions oversimplified.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combines elements competently but unimaginatively; thematic cohesion achieved at surface level without resonant synthesis of components.</comment>
