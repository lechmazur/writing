<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is thematically consistent and symbolically resonant, though psychological depth remains surface-level. His obsession with containment mirrors his emotional restraint, but lacks nuanced interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed; key turns (black-market acquisition, epiphany) lack organic buildup. The desert-skull-as-revelation lacks narrative momentum within strict constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Desert-as-laboratory is vividly rendered through sensory contrasts (dry heat vs. humming resonances). Atmosphere strongly reinforces thematic tension between nature/technology, memory/erasure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story evokes haunting wonder via metaphor-laden prose, but emotional payoff is subdued. The skull’s “prophecy” hints at deeper themes without fully penetrating their implications.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally falters into ornate abstraction (“artificial harmony created by nature”). Subtler character psychology and tighter pacing would enhance authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly dramatized. The fusion of scientific precision and mystical undertone lingers, though structural brevity limits narrative resonance.</comment>
