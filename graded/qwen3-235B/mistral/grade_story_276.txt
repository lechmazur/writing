<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Aliastair's motivation to find universal patterns is clear, but his internal conflict as an "uneasy emissary" and emotional arc lack depth. His transformation feels abrupt, though his intellectual curiosity and physical awkwardness create a distinct observational voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc of realization and action, but the tight word limit leaves the middle underdeveloped. The debris-as-metaphor connects beginning to end, though the pacing stumbles slightly between introspection and technical execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orbital station’s sensory details (rustling postcards, mechanical groans) create a specific atmosphere of claustrophobic normality in space. The fridge as a symbolic anchor works well, but the "throughout picnics" timeframe feels superficially integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (debris as redemption, postcards as human connection) elevate the narrative, and the ending’s shift from observer to active participant resonates thematically. However, emotional beats rely partly on abstraction over visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The central conceit of "branches of redemption" is refreshingly unorthodox, but occasional abstract phrasing (“cosmic ballet”) and the lone-scholar-in-space trope lean on familiar literary rhythms, slightly diminishing originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story cohesively blends assigned elements into a meditative narrative about finding meaning in chaos. While some components (e.g., picnics) feel decorative, the orbital setting and postcards particularly enhance the theme, leaving a lingering impression of fragile humanism in vastness.</comment>
