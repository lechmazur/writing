<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's dry wit is minimally expressed through dialogue, motivation is clear but shallowly explored; actions align with preserving traditions, but psychological depth beyond the 'sentinel' trope is lacking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear journey from entering to leaving the room, but the word limit compresses emotional stakes; the rope's symbolic role and journal's discovery create cohesion, though the ending feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses effective maritime details (salt air, cold breeze), but 'haunted' elements are underutilized set pieces; tone contrasts minimally with the concept, leaning into clich√©s like 'dust' and 'whispers' without subverting them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'dance of maintenance' are promising but inconsistently developed; the thematic thread of eroding promises is present but lacks textual weight; the circular structure with crossed-off names creates intellectual satisfaction but limited emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some originality in linking dance to maintenance rituals, but tropes (haunted lighthouses, frayed ropes as symbols) remain unchallenged; language avoids purple prose but occasionally defaults to generic descriptions ('swirling ghosts'); emotional impact relies disproportionately on stated determination rather than revealed subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not synergistically compelling; the brevity works thematically (a singular moment of resolution) but sacrifices deeper exploration; certain required elements (dance motif) strain credibility within the cohesive whole.</comment>
