<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Edgar's stoicism is superficially consistent but inconsistently impacts actions; motivations tied to conformity defiance are clear yet underdeveloped beyond symbolic gestures like the cameo.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from mystery to memorialization but feels compressed; cause/effect connections exist yet lack emotional weight; pacing prioritizes plot over character depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Miniature World Museum offers evocative contrasts between grandeur and intimacy; sensory details (dawn light, cameo texture) enhance mood but underutilize tactile/sensory possibilities of miniatures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (façades, cameo) and theme of individuality resonate, but "cynical warmth" remains underexplored; ending feels thematically resolved yet emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through niche settings (miniature museums, bird-cameos) but relies on vague "intelligence service" tropes; prose is purposeful but occasionally over-descriptive ("lullaby of conformity").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but occasionally strain credibility (encrypted labels in a museum); concise length works for mystery but limits emotional stakes.</comment>
