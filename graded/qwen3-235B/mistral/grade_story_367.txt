<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Inconsistent trait manifestation; "thoughtfully thoughtless" is stated but inconsistently demonstrated through actions. Motivation shifts abruptly without deep psychological grounding. Character voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Basic three-act structure exists but feels rushed. The goose's introduction lacks organic buildup; the thematic resolution feels telegraphed rather than earned within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually evocative but atmospheric elements superficially support themes. Sensory details (golden glow, storm) effectively situate the reader but don't deepen character or concept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Relies on overt symbolism (ocean/time parallels) rather than subtext. The didactic ending undercuts emotional resonance. Theme is coherent but predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Generic descriptors ("whirlwind of knowledge") and moral framework feel formulaic. Metaphors are accessible but not inventive. Tone occasionally lapses into pseudo-profundity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but insufficiently intertwined. The ending delivers a conventional message rather than creating lasting resonance. Demonstrates competence rather than distinction.</comment>
