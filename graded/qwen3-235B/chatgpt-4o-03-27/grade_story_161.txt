<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Malcolm’s vigilance and grief are well-integrated into his actions, but his internal emotional landscape remains underdeveloped. His motivations drive the plot but lack nuanced exploration of how trauma shapes his behavior beyond rigid adherence to routine.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured with clear cause-and-effect, but the climax (Rourke’s arrest) feels abrupt. The integration of elements like the sigil and pesticide map is seamless, though the resolution’s brevity slightly undermines its emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Cold War-era paper airplane facility creates an evocative, conspiratorial atmosphere, enhanced by technical jargon and sensory details (e.g., lemon drops, hangar sounds). However, some setting elements (e.g., the sub-hangar) could be more visceral to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (peacock tails, sigil) and thematic resonance (truth vs. bureaucracy) elevate the story. The ending’s visual symbolism is impactful, but minimal dialogue and a slightly rushed denouement limit deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, with fresh metaphors (e.g., engineers as “priests”) and subversion of the “conspiracy” trope. Avoids clichés through inventive details (antique seal, pesticide as art), though the brother’s backstory is cursorily handled.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The story excels in cohesion and thematic clarity, with each element (the seal, orchard ties, peacock codes) serving the plot. The brevity enhances tension, though the emotional payoff falls short of transcendent due to limited character depth.</comment>
