<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mariner’s motivation is clear but underexplored; his "coldly intense" trait feels superficially tied to actions without psychological depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has cohesion but strains under tight word limits—audience arrival and assimilation feel abrupt; resolution is conceptually tidy but emotionally rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive (violet bark, ozone scent) but occasionally leans on ornate description; setting enhances theme but some details risk sensory overload without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Emotional resonance is strong through symbolism (ladder, diary) and existential themes; ending is thematically precise but slightly undercut by predictable "price of freedom" framing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in ladder-as-cipher and collective assimilation, but metaphors (e.g., "heartbeat moss") occasionally verge on cliché; tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and thematically resonant, but word constraints expose pacing stumbles; brief length feels both deliberate and limiting.</comment>
