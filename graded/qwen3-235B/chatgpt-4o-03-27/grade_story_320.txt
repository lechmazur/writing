<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (to right imbalance via personal sacrifice) ties to actions, but internal conflicts remain broadly sketched; voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete but compressed—the pivotal realization about Elen's self-caused imbalance feels abrupt; cause-effect logic solid but pacing uneven in critical moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Underwater market is vividly realized with tactile, visual details; tension exists between mystical setting and modern social media clues, which slightly undermines cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink dissolving in water, spiral collapse) elegantly mirror themes; ending resonates emotionally but relies slightly on stated "harmonized" resolution rather than fully shown transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Genre-blending (sci-fi, magical realism) feels fresh; some phrases ("stormglass eyes") verge on cliché; emotional subtext is nuanced but occasionally underserved by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain under word count constraints; brevity works for poetic closure but sacrifices deeper exploration of paradoxical "passionate disinterest."</comment>
