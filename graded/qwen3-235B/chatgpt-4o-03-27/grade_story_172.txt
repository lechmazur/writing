<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivations tied to the prophecy and reversed wish are clear, but inner conflicts lack nuanced exploration. Character reactions rely on exposition rather than lived emotion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through object-driven actions, but the ending resolution feels abrupt despite functional cause/effect linkages. Pacing uneven in mid-section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shimmering air, shifting symbols) create immersive atmosphere. Disjointed elements like the old woman interrupt tonal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors about memory and erasure resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract narration rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through poetic inversion (heroism through remembrance), though some phrases ("whispers of wind") border on generic lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically coherent whole, but tighter integration of initial photo/hallway scene would strengthen narrative cohesion.</comment>
