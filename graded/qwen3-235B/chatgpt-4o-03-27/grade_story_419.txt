<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Contradiction between “no-nonsense” and poetic, emotional actions weakens character consistency; motivation stated rather than dramatized; empathy shown but lacks human nuances like contradiction or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Circular progression through rooms lacks clear narrative arc; cause-effect relationships implied but underdeveloped; pacing slow, meandering; completeness feels intentional but unsatisfying within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eerie, time-warped dollhouse rendered vividly with sensory details; haunted atmosphere enhances tone; setting meaningfully tied to theme of decaying memory; some generic phrases undercut immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Echoes of humanity’s will and heartbeat motif offer symbolic depth; emotional resonance is atmospheric but surface-level; ending hints at transcendence but feels abrupt; lyrical prose elevates craft despite underdeveloped plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Purple prose in excess (“time curled into itself,” “forge warmth from silence”); clichéd post-apocalyptic tropes (last custodian, haunted relics) without subversion; metaphors predictable; emotional beats stated, not shown via specific actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere for mood but not momentum; style leans on elaborate description over narrative urgency; brief length exposes thematic thinness; atmosphere lingers, but plot feels arbitrary in execution.</comment>
