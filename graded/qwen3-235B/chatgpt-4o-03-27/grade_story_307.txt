<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elira’s “spirit” is expressed through actions, but her rebellion feels more thematic than psychologically explored; motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot moves purposefully through cause-effect (DVD → messages → reactions), with a satisfying arc; pacing tightens smoothly, though the parade’s relevance feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (neon hues, static, cool night air), with the shop’s “forgotten constellations” evoking ethereal grit; setting and tone are deeply symbiotic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (“a firefly in a world of floodlights”) and layered subtext (hope vs. cynicism) elevate impact; affirmations risk preciousness but are balanced by grit.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in the DVD-neon synthesis, avoiding tropes; occasional ornateness (“whirred its final message”) and slight predictability in “child-as-symbol” dilute uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around theme; brevity feels intentional, amplifying resonance; lingering questions about societal change versus individual hope suggest depth beyond plot.</comment>
