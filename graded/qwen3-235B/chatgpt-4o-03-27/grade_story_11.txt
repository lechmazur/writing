<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nuanced flightiness shown through sensory details, but grandfather's legacy feels underexplored in shaping current motivation. Transformation from scattered to resolved occurs abruptly without sufficient psychological bridging.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Initiation ritual provides clear structure, but the "linearize chaos" action resolves too instantaneously. Pacing lags in explanation about hidden ink's mechanics before rushing the emotional climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Olfactory details (oil/parchment) and tactile description of paint texture create visceral immersion. Mechanical patch's symbolic connection to grandfather's sketchbook gives spatial coherence to the mysterious setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (maps of truth in brushstrokes, ink revealing legacy) work conceptually, but emotional beats rely partially on direct statements ("wept from serene anger") rather than fully dramatized subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through symbolic cartography, but "flicker of unity" concept remains abstract rather than organically demonstrated. Some metaphor repetition (chaos/linearization) and slight overuse of adjectives in atmospheric descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around legacy theme, though practice timeframe remains underdeveloped. The twist of maps becoming "people" reads as insightful rather than formulaic, creating reflective momentum despite tight word constraints.</comment>
