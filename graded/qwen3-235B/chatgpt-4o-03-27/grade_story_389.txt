<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is a collection of archetypal traits without psychological nuance; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through actions that reveal inner conflict or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a logically contiguous path but relies on convenient transitions (e.g., runes recognizing the figurehead); the tight word limit creates structural compression that occasionally undermines causal clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is masterfully realized through precise sensory textures (petrified wood, ink-breathing shelves), though the timeframe device (final calendar page) lacks thematic integration with the library's timeless decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance in knowledge-as-corporeal-transformation; ending evokes existential dread but the relentless sensory precision sometimes suffocates emotional engagement with the metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("inked with starlight") and familiar esoteric tropes; the recursive loop of becoming one's obsession feels conceptually derivative despite fresh atmospheric execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole with deliberate pacing, but the story's brevity leaves some thematic potentials (e.g., the calendar's temporal significance) underdeveloped.</comment>
