<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Wren's desperation and eccentricity are evident but motivation remains abstract. Actions (walking, seeking illustration) align with legacy obsession but internal logic lacks human unpredictability. Distinct voice emerges late, undercut by overly formal diction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows coherent arc but pacing falters: roller coaster's metaphysical transition feels rushed. Parallel paths concept shapes plot but resolution's "in-between" choice strains credulity. Cause-effect clear yet conceptually shallow. Word limit exposes structural seams.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Amusement park decay creates palpable dread. Sensory details (ozone, creaking metal) masterfully immerse reader. Setting as physical manifestation of legacy works brilliantly. Timeframe's "split reality" visualized through shimmering air rather than narrative mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery ('flower shaped like tongues and eyes') adds mystique but deeper themes (legacy vs. agency) surface abruptly. Ending achieves melancholic closure yet underdevelops character transformation. Tension between knowledge and madness introduced too late.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overreliance on Gothic clich√©s ("rusted gates," "wailing wind") undermines originality. Sentences occasionally spiral into baroque flourishes that detract rather than enhance. Metaphorical flourishes feel calculated rather than organic to character experience. Emotional resonance diluted by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere through shared motifs but execution prioritizes atmosphere over emotional truth. Brief form serves surreal journey but truncates character exploration. Lingering question about legacy burden emerges, though primarily through thematic repetition rather than organic narrative development.</comment>
