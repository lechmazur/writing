<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivations (self-discovery through inherited wisdom) are clear and consistent, though some emotional beats could benefit from deeper internal conflict; Elian's transformation feels earned despite limited space</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight for the word limit, with some transitions requiring reader inference; the cyclical structure (vanished mentor, inherited nest, renewal) creates satisfying coherence despite brevity</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (humming ship, nebula-fruit textures, static voice) create immersive atmosphere; the interstellar orchard concept is evocative and thematically resonant</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (grafting hybrids as self-creation, winds as change) are powerful; the theme of freedom-as-process rather than destination adds philosophical weight through layered subtlety</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some descriptions ("myth told too often") risk poetic excess, most imagery feels fresh; emotional progression avoids formulaicity through symbolic object integration rather than bald declarations</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements combine organically into unified whole; ending lingers thematically while maintaining narrative discipline appropriate to the word count</comment>
