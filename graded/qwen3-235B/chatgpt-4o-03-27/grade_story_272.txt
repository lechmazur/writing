<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character’s socially awkward, technically obsessive traits are woven into actions (isolated diner work, coded machinery) and internal conflict (past parental dynamics). Motivation (regret as a tangible construct) aligns with his inventor persona, though deeper emotional nuance in family history could strengthen. Whistle use reveals methodical desperation, not merely plot device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot circles inward rather than linear progression, creating a meditative arc fitting the theme of revisiting past decisions. Action (reversing regrets) drives minimal external events, relying on internal revelation. Pacing lingers effectively on key symbols but lacks tension spikes to anchor the word-limited structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gritty diner setting with specific sensory anchors (coffee rings, neon’s “exhalation”) creates tangible melancholy. The encrypted archive’s digital-physical hybridity contrasts meaningfully with the tactile whistle. Atmosphere flawlessly mirrors the protagonist’s liminal state between nostalgia and invention.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (“regret recyclers,” “tree of regret”) evoke existential ache beyond plot mechanics. Ending balances despair and hope without sentimentality. Subtext about apology-as-technology thrums beneath. “Showing” dominates—whistle’s physicality, the waitress’s wordless refill—while explicit introspection remains poetic rather than didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through novel conceptual blends (emotion-harvesting machines) but occasionally leans on familiar descriptors (“steam and neon cityscape”). Motivation feels logically consistent without over-explaining. Purple passages (“whistle echoes like a question”) border on overwrought but mostly enhance. Emotional impact arises from symbolic objects, not flatly stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion: diner isolation enables encrypted archive access; whistle-as-cipher keys into regret’s physicality. Lyrical compression elevates brevity. Central tension (rectifying past vs. growth) resonates beyond narrative. Would benefit from sharper stakes in emotional payoff, but contemplative ambiguity feels deliberate.</comment>
