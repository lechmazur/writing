<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Selective mutism and ventriloquism are deeply integrated into Marla’s identity and narrative, but secondary characters lack depth beyond symbolic roles. Jasper’s optimism contrasts effectively but remains one-dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tight vignette structure maintains cohesion, with atmospheric details and character interactions purposefully advancing themes. The arc from isolation to belonging feels organic within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Prismatic beach setting is lushly immersive, with sensory details (powdered glass sand, whispering tide) flawlessly amplifying emotional tones and narrative metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid imagery ("sky stitched with lightning"), symbolic objects (weather sleeves as heirlooms), and subtext about voice resonate powerfully. Ending achieves thematic payoff without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original premise avoids formulaic beats, though "parallel universe beach" leans on familiar fantastical tropes. Language balances poetic precision with accessibility; emotional nuance occasionally surfaces through subtext rather than explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive meditation on voice and belonging. Concise form enhances dreamlike momentum; lingering impact stems from layered symbolism rather than overt resolution.</comment>
