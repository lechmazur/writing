<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elric is consistent but psychologically unexplored. His stoicism drives actions but lacks complexity—motive rooted in brother's trauma feels underdeveloped. Subtextual rebellion well-conveyed; explicit characterization remains surface-level despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot has elegant cause-effect logic (cameo→labels→subversive art) but sacrifices tension to poetic atmosphere. The arc from conformity to quiet revolution succeeds in miniature scale, though 400-500 word constraints limit emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details create haunting atmosphere—glass oceans, perpetual autumn leaves. Timeframe (post-harvest) feels disconnected from mood. The museum's 'breathing' miniature worlds deepen themes through visual poetry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong subtext about sanctioned lies vs. fractured truth; metaphor of miniature rebellion as societal critique brilliantly executed. The ending resonates as existential mission statement. Show-don't-tell occasionally falters in explicit thematic statements.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution—subverts 'museum' trope into living resistance. Avoids purple prose through precise imagery ('whisper against the roar'). Nuanced emotion emerges atmospherically rather than through stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematically unified parable. Length serves the story's metaphorical scale rather than feeling restrictive. The symbolic economy (e.g., single crimson flake) demonstrates ingenuity. Some elements (harvest day) remain peripheral.</comment>
