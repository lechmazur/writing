<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are minimally developed; motivations are implied but lack depth, relying heavily on abstract traits rather than nuanced behavior. The monk’s internal conflict is sketched but not fully felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; the gondola confrontation and resolution are coherent yet rushed, sacrificing emotional weight for rapid pacing to meet word limits.</comment>
