<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (rewriting laws) aligns consistently with actions, but the professional dream interpreter trait isn't deeply integrated—her expertise feels underutilized beyond decoding vapor. Emotional conflict is present but could be more visceral through inner monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent within constraints, but the transition from receiving the invitation to rewriting the Codex feels compressed. The method (impersonation) drives the plot but lacks technical execution details that would strengthen its plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in the vapor facility—steam-as-memory metaphors create thick atmosphere. The cinnamon-scented invitation and "pipes sighing like lungs" brilliantly connect object to setting, enhancing both character motivation and the story’s conceptual tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (dreams as blueprints, laws calcifying) carry profound thematic weight. The ending resonates as poetic subversion—replacing stone with breath. Shows instead of tells rebellion through vapor-transformation symbolism and tactile descriptions of dissolving/softening thresholds.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with the dream Codex concept but occasionally slips into mechanical prose ("trusting the path would reveal itself"). Sensory details remain specific (burnt sugar, glass condensation), though the "world shifted slightly" conclusion leans on familiar speculative closure tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully chosen and interdependent. The brief form is mastered—each detail serves both plot and theme. Leaves readers contemplating truth-as-living-process. No element feels gratuitous; the story gains emotional gravity by focusing on one consequential act of rewriting.</comment>
