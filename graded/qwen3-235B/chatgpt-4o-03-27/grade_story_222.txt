<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but transformation feels abrupt; psychological complexity is implied but not fully embodied through concrete actions or consistent internal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on convenient contrivances (e.g., Andari diplomat’s timely intervention); pacing falters in balancing exposition with action within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with specific sensory details, but some descriptions verge on ornamental excess without anchoring deeper thematic or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Leverages layered metaphors (washcloth as inherited trauma, sapphire as emotional archaeology) and subtext about cultural/emotional disconnection; ending resonates thematically but emotional beats could be more grounded in character-specific behavior.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ideas are conceptually original, but execution occasionally veers into familiar "alien encounter" tropes; some poetic language feels overwritten (e.g., “gravity hummed like a lullaby”), undercutting narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere to form a poignant premise, but thematic ambition outpaces the structural and emotional precision needed for elite-tier literary status; the final revelation feels slightly under-earned.</comment>
