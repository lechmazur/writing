<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are hinted through symbolic actions but lack depth; Lune's defiance against AI remains abstract without concrete emotional grounding or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a loose arc but leans on poetic abstraction rather than causal progression; the transformation into tide weakens narrative tension, leaving momentum reliant on metaphor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush but over-reliant on ungrounded metaphors (e.g., "light of a sun not yet named"); sensory details lack specificity to immerse readers in a coherent prehistoric world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (cards as memory seeds, AI as oppression) and lyrical prose elevate emotional impact; ending feels thematically resonant but risks obscurity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but skates close to pretentiousness; some phrasing ("molecules that would become lungs") borders on poetic ingenuity more than formulaic writing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Despite abstractness, the story achieves thematic cohesion through recurring motifs (forgetting vs. memory) and leaves a haunting, mythic afterimage.</comment>
