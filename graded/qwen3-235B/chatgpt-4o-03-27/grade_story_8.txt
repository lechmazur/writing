<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's "dazed" attribute shapes initial detachment but lacks sustained exploration; motivation (wedding logic/madness) drives actions, but depth in tying traits to symbolic choices (e.g., chalk, garden) is uneven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive with thematic arc (dazed to purposeful), but the tight word limit strains subtextual development; transitions (e.g., student reply) feel slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (wind-chimes, rustling cymbals) immerse readers; atmosphere perfectly mirrors tone. Minor over-reliance on ornate metaphors risks dilution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (universe as fugue, chalk as seeds) are striking; ending resonates emotionally and thematically. Subtle tension between empiricism/chaos is masterful. Stylistic flourishes occasionally overshadow clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending music/philosophy; avoids clich√©s. Some phrases verge on purple prose ("benign ferocity" works, "rusted cymbals" borders on contrived). Nuanced emotion shows but is undercut by abstract descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story transcends assigned elements cohesively; length feels intentional. Emotional resonance lingers. Slight stiffness in integrating all components seamlessly.</comment>
