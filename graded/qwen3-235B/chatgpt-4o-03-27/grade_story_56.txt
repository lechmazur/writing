<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength: Motivation to reveal truth drives believable internal conflict in ex-swindler. Weakness: Supporting characters lack depth; woman's swift allegiance shift feels underdeveloped despite sharp dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Tight causality from dropped book to decrypted files maintains momentum. Weakness: Pacing stumbles between meet-cute and revelation; resolution feels rushed despite clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength: Post-apocalyptic orchard setting is vividly realized through sensory details and symbolic decay/renewal. Weakness: Timeframe synchronization with computer restart lacks environmental integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors like "truth blooming in orchard's heart" and moral tension between honesty/redemption resonate. Weakness: Dialogue occasionally feels performative rather than organically revealing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strength: Unique setting and thematic focus on truth-seeking subvert genre expectations. Weakness: Some AI-typical elementsâ€”generic descriptors ("strange stillness"), overly ornate similes ("harsh and gentle as spring frost").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive at surface level but lacks nuanced thematic layering required for prestige publication. Memorable atmosphere compensates somewhat for predictable redemption arc template.</comment>
