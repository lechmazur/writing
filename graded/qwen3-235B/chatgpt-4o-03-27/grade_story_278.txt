<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s artistic past informs his perception of patterns, but emotional depth feels surface-level; motivation to escape is clear but lacks nuanced evolution through the narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc with cause-effect cohesion, though the sudden decoding of the base’s secrets strains plausibility; the ending resolves the central conflict but feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting immerses through vivid, oppressive sensory details (dust, machinery), but the “murky tenderness” tone remains underdeveloped and inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., glasses as keys) and themes of perception/rebuke resonate; ending leans on poetic ambiguity over emotional payoff, slightly weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with the prison-disguised-as-research concept, but the “dust dance” disappearance risks abstraction over narrative clarity; prose balances lyricism and restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a thematically rich narrative; brevity serves the story’s mystery, though tone shifts and the abstract climax slightly undercut cohesion.</comment>
