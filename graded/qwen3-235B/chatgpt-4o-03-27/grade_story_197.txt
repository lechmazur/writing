<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While Vex's motivation is clear (sister's loss, cosmic lullaby), his internal struggles and transformation remain underexplored. Personality defined more through poetic descriptions than behavioral depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ascending arc with satisfying resolution, but limited development of tension between note-unscrambling challenges and character stakes within tight wordcount.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere through synesthetic details (ozone scent, oil-on-water leaves) creates hauntingly tangible dream-logic reality that deepens emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evokes cosmic melancholy through elegant metaphors and symbolic object use. Subtext about healing trauma through creation feels profound but could have more layered complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original mythic structure avoids clich√©s but contains occasional overly-familiar phrases ("unbearable beauty"). Sensory details remain distinctive without veering into excessive ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity despite high concept density. Left lingering questions about dream mechanics rather than feeling artificially compressed.</comment>
