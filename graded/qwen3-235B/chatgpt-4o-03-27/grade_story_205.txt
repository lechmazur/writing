<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but underexplored, with personality hinted through dialogue rather than layered actions. The 'delicate warrior' trait feels mostly aesthetic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., firefly memories). Resolution feels narratively complete but lacks emotional payoff for the secret's stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (seaweed scent, firefly constellations) create immersive atmosphere. Visual-poetic elements outshine thematic cohesion in setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (fireflies as laughter) elevate the story, though the ending's message leans simplistic. Subtext about storytelling's power resonates faintly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but includes uneven poetic phrasing (e.g., "peaceful frenzy") and slightly mechanical dialogue. Overall style feels human-crafted but uneven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist but unevenly serve the narrative. The story excels in tone and imagery but lacks a fully satisfying emotional or thematic payoff to justify its structure.</comment>
