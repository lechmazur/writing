<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; the gardener's inner conflict lacks nuanced exploration beyond surface-level longing, and the sister remains a passive figure despite pivotal revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but relies on compressed time jumps (e.g., retreat bonding) and underexplored setups (Translation Center’s role), slightly undermining emotional payoff’s earnedness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, cohesive atmosphere blends retreat serenity with emotional undercurrents; bird calls, gardens, and sensory details like soil and fabric deepen setting-memory-character connections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical symbolism (purse as buried memory, gardening as healing) and subtext-rich silence create profound emotional resonance; resolution avoids melodrama, emphasizing thematic depth over exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic pitfalls; while the purse-memory reveal leans slightly on familiar motifs, the sibling twist and emotional translation framework offer inventive subversion of nostalgia tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematically rich, but brevity occasionally strains character and worldbuilding depth; some elements (e.g., Translation Center) hint at untapped potential beyond the story’s scope.</comment>
