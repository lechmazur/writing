<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters have clear motivations but emotional depth feels surface-level; Vex's 'impulsively thoughtful' trait is inconsistently demonstrated, Kael's breakdown lacks nuanced buildup; dialogue occasionally borders on exposition rather than organic exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but leans on clich√©d beats (genius-in-exile, villainous councils); transitions between action and dialogue feel slightly forced; the sigil-activated salvation mechanism strains plausibility despite thematic justification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting immerses through vivid sensory details like flickering lights, saltwater ghosts, and pulsing algae; underwater decay metaphorically reinforces themes of abandonment and rebirth; atmosphere enhances every narrative layer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (machines as dying stars, resistance sparking in darkness) carry emotional weight; ending achieves thematic resonance; dialogue is terse yet purposeful; tension between belief and logic adds subtext; somewhat sacrifices immediacy for poetic language.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some phrases ('drowned secrets', 'machines that breathed like coral') approach purple prose; superstitious sigils powering technology feels fresh but risks genre confusion; emotional beats occasionally rely on stated 'memory' rather than dramatized trauma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story works efficiently within constraints but leans on familiar dystopian tropes (fallen geniuses, underwater labs, revolution symbolism); cohesive integration of assigned elements impresses more than narrative originality; final image lingers without profound resonance.</comment>
