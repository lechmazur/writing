<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits inconsistently inform actions; motivation is clear but underexplored, with emotional beats stated rather than deeply embodied through behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves cohesion despite tight constraints, though some transitions (e.g., hologram activation) lack grounding in the story’s logic, slightly undermining causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (antiseptic, ozone, lavender) and setting-specific decay create a haunting atmosphere that deeply supports the tone and narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance and thematic coherence strengthened by symbolism (bouquet, oath), though moments of over-articulated introspection slightly dilute subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clichés, with fresh twists on AI integration and emotional symbolism, but occasional phrases ("universe’s secret song") verge on predictable abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative effectively despite some underdeveloped connections; the thematic and emotional payoff is memorable within the word limit.</comment>
