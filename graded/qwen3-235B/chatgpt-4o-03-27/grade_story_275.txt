<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's mysteriousness serves purpose but motivation remains abstract; "theoretically rebellious" lacks depth despite poetic actions aligning with concept. Emotional interiority implied rather than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear yet cohesive arc through cyclical symbolism; cause/effect between planting and sprout is clear though pivotal moments risk subtlety. Time compression enhances inevitability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere achieves mythic texture through precise details (frostbitten soil, brittle sighs); decay and renewal inextricably tied to setting. The comet-orchard contrast creates visual and thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</comment>Subtext of memory as regenerative force resonates; poetic devices (weathervane as compass, fading comet) reward close reading. Ending avoids sentimentality but risks ambiguity about resolution scope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comma>Lapses into ornate phrasing ("moving time itself") but most metaphors (petals as seeds) feel fresh. Avoids tropes through thematic rigor though some phrases verge on literary clich√©.</comma>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong integration of constraints into thematic scaffolding; story transcends prompt elements to explore cyclical renewal. Lingering questions about human-nature symbiosis elevate beyond technical exercise.</comment>
