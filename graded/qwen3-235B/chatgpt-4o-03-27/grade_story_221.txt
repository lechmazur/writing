<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (seeking closure for father's disappearance), and the amber's role in emotional connection works, but emotional beats feel occasionally rushed. The "thawing heart" concept could have deeper integration with Cassian's actions beyond symbolic gesture in final scene.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a classic redemption arc efficiently within word limits, but the connection between the half-written letter and the carnival setting feels slightly underexplored. Pacing is mostly tight, though the transition from ghost encounter to resolution lacks nuanced buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through decayed carnival sensory details (e.g., "fade plush toys," rusted metal smell) that mirror Cassian's emotional state. The setting's juxtaposition of past joy and present abandonment effectively amplifies the story's melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery (amber as frozen time) and emotional resonance through subtext ("joyfully melancholic" reunion) elevate the story. Ending feels slightly pat, but the metaphor of a "thawing heart" lingers. Some "show, don't tell" moments undercut by direct statements like "tears tracing salt."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids complete cliché (unique ghost-diver premise), but contains familiar tropes (reconnecting with a dead father) handled with minimal subversion. Avoids heavy purple prose, yet some phrases ("silence he’d known too long") lean on abstraction over specificity. Emotional beats feel organic, if not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story weaves assigned elements cohesively, though a few (e.g., "fleeting rebellion") feel tacked on as thematic afterthoughts. The short length works for intimacy but limits deeper exploration of the father-son dynamic. Central theme of emerging from grief is clear but not fully layered.</comment>
