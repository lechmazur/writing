<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Inadequate internal motivation and underdeveloped psychology prevent full realization. Actions driven more by thematic necessity than character logic, though visual symbolism partially compensates.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear but rushed progression. Cause-effect of artifact activation lacks technical explanation, yet symbolic momentum maintains coherence. Climax feels abrupt but resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric decay details create haunting melancholy. Sensory elements ground abstract themes, though environmental interaction remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and thematic consistency elevated by visceral imagery. Some emotional beats feel predetermined rather than organically rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subversive object choice and cyclical structure demonstrate ingenuity. Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction instead of earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually unified structure contains unresolved tensions between literary metaphor and narrative plausibility. Lingers conceptually but lacks emotional marrow.</comment>
