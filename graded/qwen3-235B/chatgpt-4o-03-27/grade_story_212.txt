<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attribute "typically atypical" remains more leitmotif than psychological depth; motivation to escape is clear but its connection to character's intrinsic duality feels superficially rendered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through lyrical compression but thematic cohesion slightly undermined by underexplored temporal trauma; haunting yet fleeting</comment>
