<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weak emotional depth; traits stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful conflict or change. Character remains cryptic rather than compellingly layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but relies too heavily on atmospheric momentum rather than cause-effect logic. Some transitions lack narrative weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of surreal elements – mushroom walls, spores, contracting architecture – create a fully immersive, unnerving environment that enhances every scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical execution (vectorization as memory mapping) and resonant phrasing ("dark is honest") elevate storytelling beyond atmospheric trappings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Demonstrates genuine creativity without obvious formulaic writing. Sensory details feel specific and purposeful rather than ornamental or clichéd.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere within the self-contained surrealism but occasionally feel like set dressing rather than organic components of character or theme.</comment>
