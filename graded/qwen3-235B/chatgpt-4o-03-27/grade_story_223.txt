<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Calder's seasickness as a naval officer is ironic but underexplored; his motivation (confronting the mirror for truth) is consistent, but personality nuances remain superficial beyond poetic self-mythologizing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but the moon phase method feels underdeveloped, and the transformation resolution occurs abruptly without fully contextualizing his growth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal, sensory-rich descriptions (quartz fortress, shimmering canyon) create a haunting atmosphere, though the fortress’s connection to the timeframe feels more poetic than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (truth-blooming orchid, lying mirror) evoke emotional resonance; the ending’s catharsis is earned, though deeper psychological exploration is sacrificed for brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original use of surreal conceits (drowned cities, dreamwalkers) elevates the narrative, but some lyrical passages veer into ornate abstraction, diluting emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere effectively despite constraints, with inventive interplay between setting, character, and theme that leaves a lingering sense of mythic reckoning.</comment>
