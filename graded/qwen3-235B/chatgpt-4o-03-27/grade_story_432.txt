<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (mapping energy flows) is clear and tied to actions, but death wish lacks sufficient emotional grounding or payoff through behavior beyond the final act. The "strangely compelling" attribute remains underexplored beyond surface descriptors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight arc between collapse of sculpture and transformation, but the final revelation feels abrupt due to compressed pacing. Logical cause-effect in poisoning sequence, yet some setup (e.g., energy convergence mechanics) remains underexplained within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subterranean setting rendered through vivid sensory details (icy mist, tremors) and symbolic objects (shimmering poison, spiral) effectively. Atmospheric contrasts—serene upheaval in sculpture’s collapse as "signal"—work well, though Undermind’s societal structure feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor (flows, conduit, map) and haunting imagery creates lingering resonance. Theme of binding to truth via self-destruction is memorable but could deepen emotional immediacy. Ending subverts martyrdom tropes effectively, though some ideas lean abstract over visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise (radio psychic decoding, poison-tasting cartography) avoids tropes, with fresh metaphors (e.g., Undermind as "organs of a dreaming body"). Prose remains purposeful but occasionally veers toward density, risking slight abstraction-fatigue. Emotional nuance conveyed through symbolic action over interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively, though the Undermind’s role feels peripheral. Brief length serves thematic intensity, with final image of the drifting bookmark providing strong closure. Some tension between lyrical abstraction and concrete narrative momentum persists.</comment>
