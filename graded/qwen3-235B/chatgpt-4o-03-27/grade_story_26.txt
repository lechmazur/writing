<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation driven by shame and creative compulsion is clear, but psychological depth remains underexplored; voice lacks distinctive personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc achieves beginning/middle/end within constraints, but the transformation of figures into trees feels abrupt; pacing strained by compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details like "neon pulse" and "static melody" build atmosphere, but cyberpunk elements verge on clichéd industrial imagery; cohesive but not transformative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric linking of DNA/sound/shame elevates theme of self-acceptance; emotional beats occasionally oversimplified ("wept from release").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids generic AI rhythms with concept of shame-made-flesh, but relies on "neon dystopia" tropes without subversion; some forced lyricism ("singularly plural" underdeveloped).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements serve story’s emotional logic; brevity enhances poetic resonance, though key concepts (DNA-sound link) lack mechanical grounding for full thematic payoff.</comment>
