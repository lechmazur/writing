<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks depth in showing Elias's transformation from missionary; motivation feels abstract, not fully grounded in concrete actions or internal conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structure is episodic rather than dramatized; the piano-playing climax feels abrupt without sufficient buildup to make the discovery emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in the glass desert setting; the interplay between fragile, refracted light and the brittle protagonist's psyche is evocative and cohesive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story's mystical symbolism (fork as key, piano as decoder) creates intellectual resonance, but emotional payoff is diluted by overwritten metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery (butterflies as "absolution," piano "bones"), but relies on familiar mystical tropes without subverting archetypal expectations sufficiently.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere compensates for uneven character arc; the fusion of elements suggests ambition, but execution lacks the precision demanded by prestigious publications.</comment>
