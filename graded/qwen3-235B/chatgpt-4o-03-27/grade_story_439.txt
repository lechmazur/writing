<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Barely explores muteness beyond silence as metaphor; motivation to seek hidden truths is clear but lacks internal conflict; actions align with traits but insufficient psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linear, coherent arc with ritual buildup and transformation; comet-driven action and end-beginning linkage strong, though doorway generation lacks gradual escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (cracked marble, candle rhythm) anchor atmosphere; opera house decay and snow-storm contrast effectively, but comet’s atmospheric role remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (library of minds, spring of understanding) and thematic cohesion on self-discovery; pacing and poetic style enhance impact, though emotional subtext relies excessively on imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with unique interdimensional framework; metaphors vivid but occasionally overwrought (e.g., “whispering sheets”); organic character reasoning and subtextual emotional nuance outweigh minor formal flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements like opera house and guide deeply integrated; brevity serves thematic focus on transformation; lingering reflection on communication gaps, though comet’s role feels underexploited.</comment>
