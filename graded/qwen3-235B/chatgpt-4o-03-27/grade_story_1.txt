<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden traits surface intermittently but aren't consistently woven into actions; motivation to "dance on madness" feels more mythic than psychologically grounded; transformation arc is implied but lacks visceral emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mythic trajectory from garage sales to pyramid, but transitions between locations rely on summary rather than dramatized cause-effect; resolution feels abrupt, though circularity with blank envelope adds cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pack-rat eeriness of garage sales contrasts effectively with pyramid's dreamlike decay; sensory details (smell of salt, curve of shelves) immerse but connections between settings remain underarticulated; timeframe as recurring motif rather than functional chronology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lyrical passages about fear-as-cage resonate, but metaphor density occasionally undermines emotional immediacy; ending's mirror revelation is conceptually ambitious yet narratively under-earned; theme of inherited memory through unraveling knots lacks full philosophical development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but risks surrealism-as-shorthand (echoing voices, symbolic nets); prose vacillates between strikingly original (rib-curved shelves) and clich√©d (dancing on madness); emotional arc relies too heavily on abstract states rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly cohesive, though garage sales feel like checklist waypoints rather than thematic anchors; story transcends gimmickry through poetic language but sacrifices psychological depth for mythic abstraction; ending's quiet transformation registers but lacks lingering impact.</comment>
