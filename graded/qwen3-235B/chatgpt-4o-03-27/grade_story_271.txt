<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characterization is strong through eccentric traits, but motivation ("reveal absurdity") remains abstract without concrete contradictions or consequences to deepen psychological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is atmospheric but lacking urgency; the abrupt ghost resolution and vanishing act feel disconnected from the lab's initial menace, weakening momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sensory details like "humming jelly" and "tooth metronome" create vivid immersion, though the lab's broader decay isn't contextualized enough to sustain eerie coherence beyond isolated vignettes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (e.g., warped ruler as "twisted order") and thematic cohesion around absurdity leave lingering resonance; emotional beats are implied rather than over-explained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal objects but slips into ornate abstraction ("plasma coil regrets"); avoids clichés but occasionally prioritizes style over organic character nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements fit thematically but unevenly—spices and traditions are integral, while the "shared smile" timeframe feels superimposed rather than organically embedded.</comment>
