<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to map via memory is clear but underexplored; the brother's ghost adds emotional depth, though the protagonist remains an enigmatic figure with limited interiority beyond his prescribed role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pacing manages the word limit well, but the linear journey structure feels predictable; the ending ties back to "between sets" effectively, though the metaphysical plotting logic relies on vague resonances.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Crystalline cave is visceral and immersive, with sensory details (light, vibrations) creating a memory-echoing environment; "futuristic nostalgia" tone is evocative but underdeveloped beyond film references.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., maps as memory, love dominating death) resonate emotionally; the brother's ghost delivers a poignant climax, but the theme of "resolve" isn't fully crystallized beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unique blend of necromancy and cinematic nostalgia avoids clich√©s but leans on sentimental ghost tropes; prose occasionally veers into ornate description, though the concept of "dominate" is subversively redefined as communion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>The story feels cohesive and purposefully concise, with elements like the baseball cap and film noir references serving thematic depth; the fusion of memory, mapping, and mortality lingers thematically.</comment>
