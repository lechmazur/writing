<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters are distinct but lack complex development; sorrow is evident but motivations could be deeper than surface-level familial longing. Some nuanced internal conflict missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but pivotal moments (e.g., decoding, chamber opening) feel rushed. Plot structure is coherent but lacks layered tension beyond linear progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (scents, flickering light) and cohesive tone, but the floating fortress's implications are underexplored, weakening worldbuilding stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Eloquently written with resonant symbolism (spoon, tears) and a thematic focus on memory/healing. Dialogue is sparse but impactful; ending balances fulfillment and lingering depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in concept and execution. Unique metaphors (e.g., "exiled fortress") and emotional subtext feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Minimal purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated despite word limits, though some feel simplified. The ending transcends the brief, but narrative complexity is occasionally sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
