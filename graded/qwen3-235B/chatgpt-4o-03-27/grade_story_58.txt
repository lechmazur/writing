<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's loyalty motivates action but lacks depth; motivations tied to meditation and absurdity feel abstract rather than emotionally grounded. Limited exploration of internal conflict despite "individually common" attribute.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot adheres to structure but feels compressed; inciting incident (outage) and resolution (journal whisper) connect, but pivotal meditation lacks progression clarity. Pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust, ozone, fluttering moths) and haunting atmosphere enhance the tone of "sanctified dread." Moth tower's obscurity oddly meshes with the absurdity-core concept, but timeframe (blackout) grounds the surrealism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (storms, moths) and layered themes (absurdity as truth) resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract telling ("felt the storm rise") over visceral showing. Ambiguous ending offers thought-provoking subtext but feels under-cooked.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise (comedy as radical teaching) avoids clich√©s, but relies on generic descriptors ("sanctified dread") and overly poetic phrasing ("balanced and burning"). Emotions stated rather than nuanced through action or subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly; absurdity and meditation drive the theme, but the moth tower and "individually common" trait feel adjunct. Brevity emphasizes lyrical style over narrative complexity, leaving lingering questions rather than deliberate resonance.</comment>
