<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (shame, guilt) are clear but lack psychological complexity; emotional arcs feel somewhat reductive despite resonant themes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Structure follows a circular arc (stone wall to reef) but relies on predictable emotional beats; pacing occasionally stalls in lyrical passages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ravishing sensory immersion in marine environment; atmospheric longing permeates descriptions, though cultural/technological specifics of coral restoration remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (letters as incantations, coral restoration as redemption) resonate poetically; emotional subtext is mostly shown rather than stated, though climax verges on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally defaults to ornate abstraction ("heart of doubt"); emotional nuance and ecological detail elevate above formulaic tropes, albeit unevenly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesion between assigned elements is strong, but narrative depth and thematic ambition don't fully justify the stringent word limit's constraints.</comment>
