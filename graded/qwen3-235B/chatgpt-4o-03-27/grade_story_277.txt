<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (catalyzing "sparks") but lacks internal conflict or transformative arc; voice remains abstract rather than emotionally grounded despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Non-linear progression through the workshop creates atmospheric momentum, but the cyclical structure's thematic payoff is undercut by minimal concrete resolution or escalated stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive with tactile descriptions of rusted gears and flickering light, though the "golden age" timeframe remains more symbolic than integrated into physical laws or character urgency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Persistent metaphor of fractured beauty as hope, subtext about preservation vs. creation, and a closing image connecting personal agency to historical reclamation elevate its thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While metaphors ("cathedral of rusted gears") feel fresh, phrases like "precisely playful rhythm" risk affectation; emotional beats are shown rather than stated, but occasionally slip into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a central metaphor but unevenly: the labyrinth path and coin purse are essential, but the giant's workshop and "golden age" feel conceptually detachable despite vivid descriptions.</comment>
