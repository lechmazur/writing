<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prophet Elian’s ambivalence is thematically consistent but lacks narrative weight; his motivations feel more like poetic gestures than psychologically rooted drives. Individuality dissolves into symbolic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum exists but relies on abrupt conceptual leaps (scoreboard scrambling, dissolution into stars). Cause/effect logic falters under scrutiny; coherence is aesthetic rather than structural.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lunar colony imagery is vivid and thematically resonant ("domes cracked like marbles"), but the "between heartbeats" timeframe remains abstract rather than atmospherically realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors dazzle (cosmic scoreboard, laughter-torn sky) but occasionally overwhelm emotional grounding. Ending lingers ambiguously—the dissolution of character into abstraction is thematically purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through surreal fusion of mundane (rummage sale box) and cosmic. Occasional over-reliance on familiar "enigmatic prophet" tropes undercut by inventive imagery ("algorithms humming like sleeping gods").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements combine into a cohesive, if precarious, whole. Lunar setting and marbles are well-integrated; "jigsaw method" and timeframe strain believability. Leaves questions about fate’s mutability, but thematic intent occasionally outpaces execution.</comment>
