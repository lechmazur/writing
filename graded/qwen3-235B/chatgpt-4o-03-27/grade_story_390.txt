<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wen’s calm, poetic assassin traits are intriguing but underexplored; motivations tied to the Empress Dowager’s whims lack emotional depth despite consistent actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Coherent structure with clear cause/effect, though the butterfly-wing method feels slightly abstract; pacing manages completeness within constraints but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., “fragrant silence,” “silk of silence”) immerse readers; the moon garden setting and botanical press are evocatively tied to mood and prophecy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (prophecy as seeds/petals) and lyrical prose create impact; themes of rewriting fate resonate, though emotional resonance is uneven despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise but stumbles into ornate descriptors (“lacquered jade,” “whisper of longing”); metaphors fresh until the finale, which risks feeling contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elegant synthesis of elements into a cohesive whole; concise yet thematically resonant, though the brevity occasionally flattens stakes.</comment>
