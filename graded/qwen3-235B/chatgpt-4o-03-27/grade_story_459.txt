<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to past trauma are clear but underexplored; the brother's backstory feels thinly sketched despite anchoring Eliot's emotional arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but leans on familiar "quiet revelation" pacing; some transitions between Eliot's routines and the supernatural encounter need tighter integration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory immersion is strong but inconsistentâ€”humidity in the lab contrasts with elevator shafts effectively, yet the boardwalk setting remains underutilized beyond atmospheric shorthand.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve the story's emotional nucleus effectively, though the lunch-break timeframe feels more functional than thematically essential.</comment>
