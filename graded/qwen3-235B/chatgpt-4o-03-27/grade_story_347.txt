<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but psychological depth remains thin; the trait of being "singularly multiple" influences narrative voice more than concrete behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints, though reliance on shoelace as both literal and symbolic device strains credibility; puzzle's resolution feels earned despite tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create tangible atmosphere; perpetual motion machinery and organic vine form compelling contrasts, though timeframe element (thought experiment) feels underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate deeply, particularly "faith is surrender" and "grow where broken"; ending achieves thematic closure while avoiding didacticism; subtext about fractured identity enriches narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional purple prose ("broken hymn"); avoids tropes generally but some phrases ("warm floor") lack specificity; emotional resonance feels more carefully curated than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work in concert rather than competing; brevity enhances mystical atmosphere; creates lingering philosophical questions that transcend plot mechanics.</comment>
