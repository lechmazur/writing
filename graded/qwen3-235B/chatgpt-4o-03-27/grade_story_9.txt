<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits like panic and sarcasm are present but underdeveloped; motivation to shape destiny feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded, with inconsistent emotional nuance in reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (opening boxes to planting the seed) but strained by abrupt metaphysical shifts and undercontextualized cause-effect chains (e.g., box-to-seed logic). Pacing is uneven at critical moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (billboards, neon, ozone scent) create a cohesive, unforgettable atmosphere. Tonal contrast between desolation and faint hope enhances thematic resonance, though setting-character integration is uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolic objects create subtext. The ending feels slightly sentimental but successfully ties to the theme. Emotional impact is undercut by some over-explanation (e.g., "stewardship wasn't optional").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh combinations (cactus bartender, cursed puzzle box) but contains AI-like phrasing ("neon-lit desert buzzed like a dying fly") and occasional purple prose. Emotional beats are shown but not fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story coheres around core elements despite tonal shifts; brevity feels deliberate but some forced connections (e.g., watering metaphor). Lingering thematic resonance is achieved, though imperfectly.</comment>
