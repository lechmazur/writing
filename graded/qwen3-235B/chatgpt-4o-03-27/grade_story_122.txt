<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character consistently driven by trauma, but inner conflict remains static - motivations are stated, not demonstrated through evolving choices. "Patiently frantic" lacks integration into behavioral nuances.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through cyclical ritual rather than traditional arc. Pacing efficient but sacrifices emotional weight in climax. Beginning/end bookend effectively but lack textural complexity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Astonishing sensory cohesion between bleached bones and refracted light creates tangible spiritual decay. Setting operates as character itself, perfectly mirroring thematic concerns through environmental metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visceral imagery and conceptual resonance evoke primal awe rather than emotional intimacy. Ending achieves thematic closure but lacks narrative surprise. Metaphors work overtime to carry weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through radical juxtapositions, but some phrases ("blade that turned storms inward") veer toward expected mythic register. Emotional states telegraphed through metaphor rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally feel like symbolic scaffolding rather than natural storytelling. The brevity works conceptually but sacrifices human-scale emotional engagement.</comment>
