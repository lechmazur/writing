<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Limited depth beneath overt symbolism; motivation clear but feels abstract rather than psychologically nuanced, with inconsistent emotional grounding despite thematic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight arc with atmospheric momentum, but pivotal transitions (discoloration, mirror ritual) rely on poetic vagueness over narrative logic, slightly undercutting cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rosemary-regret brew, whispering graveyard, and lull of protest voices create immersive gothic texture; atmospheric details masterfully intertwine with character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (mirror as intention-revealer) and layered theme of performative/embodied values resonate, though somber tone occasionally verges on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in blending mystical and social realism, but occasional baroque phrasing ('flask of regret') risks pretension; emotional beats could feel more earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize thematically (graveyard protest interplay), though timeframe feels obligatory rather than integral; ending lingers effectively as metaphor-laden transformation.</comment>
