<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's undercover motive drives action but lacks depth; her "suspiciously trusting" nature emerges abruptly yet resolves conflicts too easily without internal tension or backstory contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression from ritual to encounter to resolution works within constraints, but candle ritual lacks explanation; emotional payoff feels rushed despite strong connective symbolism in mirror healing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere excels through sensory details (shimmering mirrors, charred wick textures) but leaf raking feels incidental rather than integral to the setting's mythic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (mirrors as fractured truth, seeds as hope) elevate thematic resonance; ending delivers bittersweet closure but emotional beats rely partly on stated wisdom rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original concept compromised by sporadic overwritten passages ("feathered enigmas") and overly mystical exposition; candle ritual methodology remains vague, preventing full immersion in its logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story feels purposefully compressed but depends heavily on symbolic elements to mask thin plot mechanics; lingering impact stems from mirror imagery rather than narrative complexity.</comment>
