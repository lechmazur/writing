<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is emotionally resonant, but internal conflict lacks sufficient depth; actions align with traits but nuance in transformation feels rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates cohesion and a clear emotional arc, but the transition through the water mirror feels abrupt within the tight word limit, slightly undermining pacing precision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolism are potent (fireworks/forgiveness, leaves/memory paths) but occasional abstraction (ephemeral nature of time) weakens subtextual clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong originality in merging magical realism with personal reckoning; occasional ornate passages risk veering into poetic excess but overall maintains freshness and emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional integration of assigned elements into thematic cohesion; brief length amplifies emotional impact rather than limiting it; faint predictability in redemption arc prevents perfection.</comment>
