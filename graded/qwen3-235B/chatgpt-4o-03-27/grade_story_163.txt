<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (finding father/truth) drives action, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Internal conflict is hinted through memory fragments but not fully explored. Bitter optimism lacks nuanced contradiction in behavior. Distinct voice falters during exposition-heavy moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Detour framing creates circular structure (overlook arrival/return), but transformation scene feels rushed. Core concept drives plot direction effectively. Logical cause-effect (stub grants access → neural sync → revelation) maintained despite tight word count. Pacing drags slightly in lab description passages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, integrated sensory details (ozone/alien flora, fractal light patterns) immerse readers in setting. Xenobiology station's fractured reality physically manifests through unstable architecture and time-warped chamber. Cloud migration motif reinforces temporal dislocation theme. Atmosphere directly mirrors protagonist's psychological state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (map/becoming, fracture/unification) carry thematic weight. Ending achieves emotional resonance through cyclical imagery (persistent clouds vs. transformed consciousness). Subtext about identity commodification via heiress/research angles. Some ideas feel underdeveloped (mother's laughter memory lacks payoff).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but relies on "vanishing father" archetype. Fresh use of parking stub as both literal and symbolic key. Purple prose near-avoidance (exosuit technician's clichéd "you're late" line mars otherwise). Emotional nuance present but occasionally undercut by explicit "bitterly optimistic" labeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohesive but unevenly weighted—parking stub/xenobiology station dominate while timeframe (cloud migration) feels superficial. Style supports clarity most but stumbles during rapid concept introduction (Lab 7's time-folding explained through vague origami metaphor). Premise shows inventiveness but execution prioritizes mood over explanatory rigor.</comment>
