<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is consistent but underexplored; motivation to translate lullabies lacks emotional grounding despite symbolic resonance with wooden spoon.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Circular structure works but pacing falters during introspective moments; cause-effect between lullabies and memory dissolution feels underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but struggle with pragmatic narrative execution; lingering existential questions about memory-humanity connection elevate overall impact.</comment>
