<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character's dream-thief past shapes his isolation but lacks deeper psychological complexity; motivation to remember stolen identities is clear though under-explored; mathematical challenges serve as quirk but don't influence major decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has strong through-line from stolen memories to sky's weeping, though some transitions feel underdeveloped; action of playing skyball drives character development rather than advancing plot; compact coherence works within word limit despite slight narrative leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Desolate atmosphere of dying world perfectly complements quiet mania of protagonist; petrified oak and forgotten treehouse library are vividly realized; sensory details about warped photos and groaning wood evoke emotional isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with effective metaphors (dreams as fireflies, photos as memory shards); emotional impact emerges through symbolic objects rather than stated feelings; ending resonates with thematic unity about memory and rebirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through unique dream-theft conceit; some poetic descriptions border on purple prose; mathematical struggles feel slightly formulaic; emotional journey feels authentic despite fantastical context; metaphors remain specific rather than generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around fractured identity theme; brevity feels intentional rather than limiting; subtle exploration of consequence and redemption lingers; not quite reaching transcendent heights but substantial for short form.</comment>
