<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective blend of past deceit and current sincerity, but redemption arc feels slightly compressed; the lullaby and flame interactions deepen motivation but lack nuanced complexity in personality evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure risks coherence, but thematic unity between detour and revelation salvages plot flow; abrupt transitions between waiting room and canopy village slightly disrupt pacing within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (bioluminescence, rainforest humidity) create a tangible atmospheric foundation; integration with emotional stakes could be tighter to avoid occasional "set piece" detachment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of the flame as hope and memory interplay effectively; lyrical language and cyclical structure elevate emotional resonance; ending avoids sentimentality while leaving lingering thematic questions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s (redemption through sacrifice feels earned, not saccharine); some phrasing ("stitched into his soul") borders on overused; tone maintains consistency despite whimsical elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Strong thematic cohesion across elements without feeling forced; brevity prevents exploration of deeper psychological layers but serves the story's poetic tone effectively.</comment>
