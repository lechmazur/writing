<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s exorcist background and motivation to blend science with wonder are clear, but her internal conflicts lack depth; her “inwardly social” trait is mentioned but only superficially drives her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot’s progression from puzzle-solving to the hidden room is logically structured but feels hurried, with some abrupt transitions (e.g., postcard discovery to final machine activation) diminishing narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts—dance rhythms vs. sterile hums, mirrors vs. electromagnetic energy—create a haunting atmosphere, though the dance motif’s thematic role remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of scientific and mystical elements is intriguing, and subtext about obsession/legacy resonates, but emotional stakes and subtext about isolation are thinly sketched.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The puzzle-to-hidden-room trope feels somewhat formulaic, and Elara’s “coy aggression” borders on contrived; however, the psychic facility’s eerie tone and subversive blending of MRI/altar avoid cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story deftly threads its assigned elements into a cohesive whole, but the dance motif and “guarded disclosures” feel ancillary; the ending lingers ambiguously but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>
