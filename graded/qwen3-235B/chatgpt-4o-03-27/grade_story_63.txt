<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but lacks psychological depth; motivations are clear yet somewhat abstract, defined more through symbolic actions than personal conflicts or nuanced interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progression is linear but occasionally reliant on montage-like transitions; emotional beats resonate, but structural complexity feels constrained by the tight word count without full development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously constructed through rich sensory details (e.g., “echoes curled like smoke,” “choir...seeping like gauze”), creating a hauntingly immersive world that deeply supports the narrative’s themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Uses lyrical metaphors and symbolic resonance effectively; the ending achieves thematic cohesion, though some emotional weight leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally veers toward ornate descriptions that risk overwhelming the narrative flow; metaphors are inventive, though consistency in tonal restraint could improve.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally woven into a cohesive whole, balancing brevity with ambition; the story suggests deeper implications without fully exploring them, leaving room for post-reading contemplation.</comment>
