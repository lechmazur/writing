<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strengths in contrasting Bruhn’s violence with emotional depth, but underdeveloped secondary elements (e.g., brother’s agency). Motivation is clear but lacks complexity in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with effective cause/reasoning, but the resolution feels abrupt; the brother’s emergence could use more buildup within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse and drum solos create a visceral, haunting atmosphere; sensory details (glass shattering, scent of soil) immerse readers but occasionally lean toward overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (baton as chisel, myths from mud) and emotional subtext elevate impact; ending’s silence speaks louder than words, though some imagery risks becoming self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh connections (baton/conductor/resurrection), but phrases like “lullabies in the air” and “twist of silence” verge on purple prose; avoids formulaic pacing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize; each detail (baton, greenhouse, drum solos) serves theme or character; brevity enhances focus, though the ending’s poetic ambiguity may polarize readers.</comment>
