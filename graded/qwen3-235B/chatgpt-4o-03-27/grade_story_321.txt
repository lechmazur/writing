<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Guard’s motivation (regret, fragmented redemption arc) is clear but psychological depth feels secondary to poetic abstractions; emotions are implied through symbols (ribbon, hourglass) rather than embodied psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots on turning the hourglass and crossing the threshold, but progression relies on lyrical metaphors rather than causality; lacks a fully satisfying narrative arc within the word limit despite haunting imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Infernal kitchen’s sensory details (hissing steam, flickering flames) create an oppressive, liminal space that mirrors the guard’s guilt; atmosphere is the story’s strongest, most cohesive element.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (sand as “frozen screams,” door of “bone and regret”) are visceral and original; prose elevates the emotional tenor beyond its minimal plot, though some phrases flirt with purple prose (“abrasive calm”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story avoids genre tropes but occasionally leans on ornate descriptions (“cosmic silence,” “dreamlike hourglass”); emotional resonance is present but occasionally undercut by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements (ribbon, hourglass, kitchen) are tightly woven into theme and atmosphere, creating a unified mood; however, the narrative arc remains underdeveloped within the constraints.</comment>
