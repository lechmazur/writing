<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but underexplored; midwifery ties to themes of life/birth but doesn't deeply shape her methods or decisions. Personality feels archetypal rather than lived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing uneven â€“ rapid revelation at the well feels rushed. Strong circular structure but lacks tension in transitions. Resolutions align with setup but require narrative leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (burnt paper, herb scents) and surreal imagery (face-shaped fruit, maelstrom) create haunting cohesion between setting and psychic journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (birth/death, burning/preserving). Ending resonates thematically but emotional payoff diluted by rushed epiphany. Powerful subtext about self-betrayal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Some overly ornate phrases ("dissonant calm like a forgotten lullaby"), but original conceits (memory-as-fruit, willful amnesia) subvert fantasy tropes. Emotional nuance prioritizes poetry over human messiness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High stylistic accomplishment with minor gaps in character depth and thematic payoff. Elements synergize effectively but occasionally feel like thematic checklist fulfillment rather than organic expression.</comment>
