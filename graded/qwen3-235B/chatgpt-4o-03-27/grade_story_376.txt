<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths lie in Svala’s sharply etched motivations and her use of the inkwell as a manifestation of her emotional archiving. The merchant’s grief and longing lack deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Driven by the quiet tension between unspoken connection and inevitable separation. Pacing is taut but resolution feels abrupt within constraints; cyclical structure between the aurora and later wine-tasting maintains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bleak, luminous fusion of past/future in the longhouse—glass/iron, constellations/refracted amber light—creates a tactile, eerie atmosphere that mirrors emotional undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (ink as "trapped sunlight," grief as wine-taste) and layered subtext elevate the narrative. Ending’s focus on unspoken truths lingers thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ("modestly flashy," "amber inkwell") verge on ornate, but most imagery (zigzag script mimicking conversation) feels fresh. Emotional nuance is shown through gesture, not statement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interweave organically—the longhouse as emotional vault, wine tasting as revelation method, the inkwell as archival tool. Ending’s quiet permanence rewards reflection.</comment>
