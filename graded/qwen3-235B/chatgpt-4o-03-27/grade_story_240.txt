<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Well-sketched but lacks emotional depth; motivations clear yet internal conflicts underdeveloped, relying on vague references to "hollows" rather than tangible character struggles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight structure overall, though assigned action (manufacturing miracles) is more backdrop than driving force; abrupt transformation lacks nuanced buildup despite effective closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere sustained by sensory details (ash scent, groaning bark), but integration of setting with character's arc occasionally superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic imagery and resonant themes of sacrifice elevate impact; some "telling" weakens immersion, but ending lingers powerfully with thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality in merging craftsman tools with mystical functions, but overused archaic motifs ("whispering forests") and occasionally bloated phrasing dilute distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements serve narrative purposefully, though constrained by formulaic mythic undertones; concise length maximizes thematic resonance but sacrifices deeper emotional investment.</comment>
