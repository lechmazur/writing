<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's contradictory traits (anxiously relaxed) and cosmic birthright motivation lack nuance; actions feel symbolically heavy but emotionally distant. Voice exists but feels more authored than lived.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically (mask scene to confrontation) but cosmic blink framing feels imposed rather than earned; cohesion exists within word limits, though kilter resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Phenomenal sensory immersion in chlorophyll scent and marble reflections; timeframes (cosmic blink vs. office routine) create striking tension but undercut grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic precision in metaphors (shattered mask as remembrance/rebellion); ending resonates as quiet revolution; theme of chaos vs. classification is potent and layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal juxtapositions (birdwatcher as chaos agent, nonviolent rebellion through porcelain); occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., "cosmic inheritance") risks self-parody.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Elements feel deliberately interconnected (mask reflects shattered order, leaf symbolizes wildness); cosmic and bureaucratic elements create intriguing friction but uneven tonal balance.</comment>
