<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's spinelessness and motivation are clear but underexplored; reactions to objects hint at depth but lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but the plot lacks tangible stakes or progression, relying on symbolic gestures over narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is lushly realized with visceral sensory details; the greenhouse and toxic sky vividly amplify the storyâ€™s existential melancholy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is original, but some metaphors (e.g., "statically dynamic vines") feel contrived; the tone occasionally veers into self-indulgent poeticizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere atmospherically but strain under thematic ambition; the story excels in mood over substance, leaving the central question of "meaning" unresolved in a way that feels evasive rather than profound.</comment>
