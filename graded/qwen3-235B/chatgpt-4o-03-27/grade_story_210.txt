<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but not deeply explored; Marlowe's static nature limits deeper engagement despite his eccentric precision shaping actions. The blend of "amiable" traits with obsessive intellectual drive lacks nuanced conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing is generally controlled but slightly rushed; the storm-to-sunlight transition strains causality. Plot logic holds, but the tight word limit sacrifices build-up to key emotional beats, leaving the arc feeling compressed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through evocative details (salt-streaked glass, Morse-like light pulses) and consistent haunting tone. The "waiting room" timeframe is underdeveloped, weakening its thematic resonance despite strong setting integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("language older than sails") are striking, but emotional impact leans on lyrical prose over character depth. The ending’s meditative tone satisfies thematically but lacks subtext complexity to elevate beyond surface mysticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality is moderate—trope-heavy premise (haunted lighthouse scholar) elevated by unique methods (crossword as code) but marred by occasional clichéd phrases ("bones clattering in a forgotten chest"). Prose is purposeful but occasionally veers into excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story succeeds in cohesion, balancing multiple elements (timbers, crossword) within compressed length. Style serves clarity, but emotional lingering is superficial; the final blank square gesture feels underexplored as thematic punctuation.</comment>
