<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s "gentle brawler" duality is visually evoked but underexplored emotionally; motivations are stated rather than deeply dramatized through actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but slight; the flat tire as method feels contrived, though the cyclical ending ties into the thematic "between verses" timeframe effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered through specific sensory details (smell of spices, weight of silence) that enhance mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong literary devices (e.g., echo chamber as metaphor) and lyrical prose elevate impact; themes of memory and collective change resonate, though occasionally verge on abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining a brawler’s tactile world with ethereal concepts; avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on ornate phrasing that distracts from emotional core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically and stylistically, with deliberate brevity; uneven element integration (e.g., flat tire’s forced relevance) slightly undermines cohesion.</comment>
