<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (rescuing sister's truth) and tied to assigned traits, but inner struggles lack depth; apprehensiveness feels surface-level despite moments of tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has coherent structure with beginning/middle/end, but pacing feels rushed during memory tank sequence; cause/effect relationships hold, though some transitions lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrasts between candlelight/server hum create immersive atmosphere; ancient/cyberpunk setting synergy effective, but "bones of an ancient timeline" underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphor use (candle as rebellion, cycles as healing) and emotional resonance in memory restoration; some emotional beats feel told rather than shown, particularly denouement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mixed originality: archer/cyberpunk fusion fresh, but hot-air-balloon-festival setup clich√©d; "fragile rebellion" veers toward poetic overuse, while Luma's AI origin feels unexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Element integration mostly cohesive but uneven; borrowed dawn tone and sister's message create lingering impact, while festival setup and Temple history feel externally imposed.</comment>
