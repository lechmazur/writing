<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Corven’s motivation is clear as a rebel custodian of forbidden knowledge, effectively demonstrated through symbolic actions (birdcage imagery, nightly explanations). Secondary characters lack depth, weakening collective motivation consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc exists (Corven’s defiance → village transformation → disappearance), but pacing stumbles between exposition and resolution. Cause/effect logic holds, though the word limit strains emotional payoff for secondary plots.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi, spore-dusted villagers, and decaying signage create vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details excel, but the setting’s fantastical elements don’t fully integrate with the thematic weight of crumbling illusions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (caged silence as complicity, disintegration as truth-seeking) resonate deeply. Ending’s thematic resonance (whispers erode lies) satisfies; subtext about inherited belief systems elevates the narrative beyond surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in concept (mycelial songbirds, feral elegance) but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing (“cloaks stitched from moss and moth wings”). Nuanced emotion emerges through symbolism, but some transitions risk feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity (minstrel’s voice mirrors tone; birdcage drives arc), but the micro-fiction format sacrifices secondary character nuance. Lingering questions about tradition/defiance pair with a deliberately bittersweet resolution.</comment>
