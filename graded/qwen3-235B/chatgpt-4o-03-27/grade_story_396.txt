<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation to protect 'fragile wonder' is clear but inconsistently developed; character traits like forgetfulness drive key plot points but lack psychological depth beyond whimsical surface behaviors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot propelled by fortuitous encounters; cohesion achieved through symbolic resonance (glass fragment/lens connection) but pacing falters during technical explanations of the lens's historical significance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense thematic layering with near-perfect element integration; brevity enhances urgency despite minor structural awkwardness in exposition delivery.</comment>
