<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's philosophical motivations and mechanical arm are thematic but lack grounded emotional development; internal conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains structural coherence through symbolic object-deconstruction, but the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic resonance; pacing uneven in key emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and thematically integrated; lighthouse setting, fractured light, and sea sounds create a haunting sensory landscape that mirrors the protagonist's internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</comment>Strengths: Evocative metaphors ("applause from the sea"), layered subtext exploring philosophical duality, and a transformative ending that transcends narrative brevity through thematic precision and lyrical economy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative avoids most clichés but occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction ("tangibly abstract ideas") that risks obscuring emotional authenticity; metaphors are fresh but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story succeeds through tight thematic unity and atmospheric originality, though character psychology remains tantalizingly opaque—a calculated artistic choice with mixed accessibility implications.</comment>
