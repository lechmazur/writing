<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is motivated by desire to matter, but lacks depth beyond insecurity; motivation aligns with actions but remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc exists but pacing feels rushed, especially the abrupt transition from discovery to transformation; logical but underdeveloped cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, vivid atmosphere enhances tone; sensory details (e.g., trembling room, blue fluid) immerse. Slight overuse of poetic abstraction risks losing grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (brain as fractured self) and open-ended ending provoke thought; emotional impact diluted by abstract narration over concrete reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but skirts purple prose ("silence hummed louder than machines"); the "duplicate" concept subverts expectations with thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but feel slightly constrained by word limit; ending's philosophical tone suits the premise, though depth sacrificed for brevity.</comment>
