<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character is vividly realized through eccentric actions and motivations, but inner conflicts remain underexplored. Consistent voice and symbolic connection to objects, though emotional depth feels selectively applied rather than fully dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure (returning annually) functions within the constraint, but lacks urgent narrative progression. Events accumulate rather than build tension; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned, with minor shifts failing to create strong stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lushly constructed through sensory paradoxs (decaying yet alive, apathetic yet urgent) and the giant’s shoe as a liminal space. Time distortion and material blending (tarp, feathers) evoke mythic decay with remarkable precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (whip as baton/bridge, soil as novel) are fresh and resonant. The story’s thematic obsession—listening as a form of communion—deepens through sparse but potent subtext. Ends thematically unified but emotionally withheld.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagined objects (whip, shoe) and existential tension between apathy/urgency. Avoids clichés but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction (“soil’s moods”) that borders on over-refinement rather than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a haunting vision of obsessive, solitary purpose. Tight prose and symbolic cohesion elevate it beyond gimmickry, though its brevity leaves the theme more suggested than fully resonant.</comment>
