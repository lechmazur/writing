<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Unique, trope-defying imagery (floating dojo, whispering funeral wreaths) avoids formulaic phrasing, with language that balances poetic precision against accessibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story cohesively combines elements into a contemplative whole, though its abstract tone and lack of external conflict limit broader appeal despite literary merits.</comment>
