<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched but motivations are occasionally surface-level. Internal conflict is implied rather than deeply explored. Distinct voice present but psychological complexity remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherent arc despite tight constraints. Logical progression from storm aftermath to rescue mission. Pacing efficient but underexplains certain transitions like marbles' decoding. Satisfying circularity between opening/closing imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through sensory specifics - neon glow, metallic tang of storm residue, mechanical ambiance. Cyberpunk grit contrasts with tangible warmth of analog artifacts. Atmosphere directly reinforces theme of lost humanity in mechanized world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong literary craft with symbolic weight (hatpin as crown, marbles as legacy). Ending resonates thematically while maintaining mystery. Subtle showing of emotional transformation through physical gestures. Tension between apathy/hope drives narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through juxtaposition of swashbuckler ethos with cyberpunk. Some phrasing leans toward atmospheric conventionality ("neon veins") but metaphors like "fervent apathy" inject freshness. Emotional shading implied rather than declamatory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively without feeling checklist-driven. Narrative compression works to story's advantage, emphasizing mythic quality. Lingering resonance emerges from cyclical structure - marbles rolling anew after being static.</comment>
