<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character motivation (restoring carousel and self) is clear, but "eagerly unwilling" trait feels ambiguously applied. Voice remains consistent in third-person introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves completeness within constraints; decoding tapestry logic drives action. Pacing balances introspection with discoveries, though chamber discovery feels slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Alpine monastery and desert settings are vividly contrasted through precise sensory details (wind, dust, corroded metal). Atmosphere amplifies themes of decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through layered metaphors (tapesry as memory, tongs as legacy). Ending delivers thematic payoff without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality in combining storm chaser with monastic preservation, though "inner strength" theme leans on familiar arcs. Avoids purple prose but occasionally relies on predictable symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements serve story cohesively; brevity enhances urgency. Leaves lingering question about reconciling stillness with movement in personal growth.</comment>
