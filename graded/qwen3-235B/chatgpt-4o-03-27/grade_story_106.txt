<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's bias and sullenness anchor his perspective, but motivation to erase boundaries through abstract symbols lacks visceral emotional grounding. Quilt's ancestral whispers hint at depth but are briefly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of transformation within constraints. Stamp-scattering and quilt-activation drive action logically, though some transitions (e.g., machine recognizing quilt-pattern) feel under-explained for strict realism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid brine, rust, and algae create an immersive aquatic decay. Atmosphere echoes character's emotional stasis, but the underwater city's history remains unexplored, weakening thematic connection to 'forgotten' boundaries.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich ending ("stitch in a new story") resonates. Subtext about inherited identity vs. self-determination emerges through tactile details, though some imagery (dissolving patches of light) verges on abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; "borrowed valor" and quilt-as-map offer fresh spins on generational legacy tropes. Over-reliance on adjectives ("corroded," "barnacle-covered") occasionally dilutes impact, but lyrical phrasing feels human-crafted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but occasionally rely on poetic logic over narrative tension. The brevity feels purposeful yet leaves some conceptual corners underdeveloped (e.g., stamps' symbolic purpose beyond "weight").</comment>
