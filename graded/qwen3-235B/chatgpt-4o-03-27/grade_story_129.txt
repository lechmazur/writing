<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks interiority; motivation is clear but emotionally underexplored. The troubadour's reactions to objects hint at legacy but remain symbolic rather than humanely visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Modest structural coherence achieved through lyrical progression; beginning/middle/end arc implied through ritualistic actions. Pacing is dreamlike but occasionally loses momentum in metaphor-dense passages.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory specificity grounds the abstract theme: the metallic ring's coldness, the ash smell, the scaffolding's tremor. Contrasts between decay and spiritual reanimation create powerful atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment>Exceptional imagery ("tablecloths like sails") and thematic resonance about legacy. Over-reliance on heavy-handed symbols (e.g., "cartographer of empathy") dilutes emotional subtlety; ending risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through imaginative combinations but contains moments of uneven prose – certain phrases ("hushed euphoria") verge on artificial lyricism. Emotional progression feels slightly algorithmic in its archetypal structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story transcends checklist-style element assembly through its poignant mythmaking. Some elements serve theme more convincingly than plot logic, but the cumulative metaphor of healing through inherited stories resonates memorably.</comment>
