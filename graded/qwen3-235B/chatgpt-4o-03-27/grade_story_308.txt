<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character traits like bashfulness drive key moments (blush, flinch), but deeper exploration of conflicting executioner/dancer roles needed; motivation clear but somewhat one-dimensionally heroic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure shows clear arc within constraints, but ritual climax relies on compressed emotional beats; pacing works but lacks room for tension development beyond internalized struggles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory atmosphere with tides/sandalwood/seaside festival creates immersive setting; object-setting connections (lotus keychain, studio) enhance thematic resonance through repeated water/land dichotomies.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memorable juxtapositions (ferocity/grace, silence/chaos) and symbolic imagery elevate; showing through physical reactions (clutching keychain, falling hood) strengthens impact despite occasional surface-level emotional descriptors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar arcs (redemptive artist trapped in violent role); some phrases ("fluid, fierce, and full of grace") verge on polished abstraction rather than visceral originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements present with logical interconnectivity; story benefits from tight focus on ritual moment rather than feeling constrained; themes resonate through complementary contrasts (tides/stillness, secrecy/community).</comment>
