<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits are clear but lack psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than organically revealed through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arc is coherent with tight structure, but episodic progression weakens emotional stakes; connections between scenes rely heavily on exposition rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details anchor readers in a decayed, post-revolution world; the silent revolution’s atmosphere enhances thematic tension through restraint and lingering traces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Imagery of light and preservation elevates the narrative; subtext about memory and resistance is layered, though some metaphors verge on overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh, specific details (urban horticulturists, half-finished tapestries) avoid formula; prose is lyrical without veering into ornamental excess, but tone occasionally leans overly solemn.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively woven into a tight narrative that transcends its brevity; emotional resonance lingers, though the story’s polished elegance risks feeling slightly detached from raw human stakes.</comment>
