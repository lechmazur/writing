<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (curiosity driving action) is clear, but "aloof" trait lacks nuanced exploration beyond surface detachment. Reactions to the logbook reveal intellectual obsession more than emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression via logbook clues is logical but rushed; bureaucratic neglect twist feels underdeveloped. Pacing uneven—stacking plot elements strains 500-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shipping container labyrinth evokes claustrophobic decay effectively, with sensory details about rust and fog. Atmosphere supports themes but lacks visceral integration with character actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ending resonates thematically with circularity ("first believe"), metaphors (labyrinth as archive) work well. Impact diluted by exposition-heavy middle sections.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by framing "bureaucratic neglect" as submerged city antagonist. Some vague descriptors ("living archive," "innovative nostalgia") flirt with abstraction without full embodiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but uneven execution—logbook’s mystery drives momentum while character psychology and setting symbiosis remain undercooked.</comment>
