<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation clear but thinly developed; Elian's cooking background doesn't meaningfully shape his investigative actions or emotional arc. The pencil eraser's symbolic weight contrasts with flat characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently through discovery and revelation, but the tight word limit flattens the hatch-opening climax. The cyclical structure around "dust" works, though resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thick atmosphere of decay and buried history immersive through tactile details (dust cascading, groaning gears). Setting's scientific purpose feels underexploited, though.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("flavor a forgotten letter") and subtext about truth as seismic force yield intellectual resonance. Overreliance on abstract phrases like "impossibly conceivable" slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Trope of lone truth-seeker avoids clich√© through seismic/linguistic fusion, but purple prose ("frenzied tranquility") and overly neat symbol-repetition (dust, notches) suggest slight algorithmic flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (seismic truth, culinary metaphor), though pacing unevenness and secondary plot mentions (vanished brother) strain cohesion within word constraints.</comment>
