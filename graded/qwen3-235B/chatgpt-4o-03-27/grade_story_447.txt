<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Marla’s transformation feels internally consistent, but her moral clarity lacks nuanced conflicts. Her defiance lacks the messy vulnerability that would make her truly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot’s arc is clear but compresses pivotal moments (e.g., council’s collapse) too abruptly. The pacing balances momentum and brevity but strains plausibility in key transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ember Hollow’s atmosphere is evocative (rosemary, amber light), but the setting leans more on metaphor than lived-in detail. The “amber prison” feels underexploited as a symbolic space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Excellent use of symbolism (bulletins as ash, the toy ear as reconciliation). The theme of healing through truth resonates, though emotional beats occasionally border on sentimental without sufficient complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but risks romanticizing rebellion’s consequences. Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into lyrical overstatement (“whispers of rising dough” feels overly quaint).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified parable, though some (council confrontation) feel schematic. The story transcends its brevity but lacks the layered character depth to fully elevate it.</comment>
