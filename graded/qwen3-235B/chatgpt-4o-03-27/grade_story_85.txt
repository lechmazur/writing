<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; the swordsman's actions are consistent with his pursuit of wisdom, but his personality remains abstract and undeveloped beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on atmospheric progression rather than structural momentum; the connection between discovery and resolution is symbolic but feels underdeveloped, leaving the arc emotionally sparse within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse the reader in the petrified forest, but the schematic's metaphysical qualities lack grounding, creating dissonance between setting and object.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism; the twist of the schematic as a mirror resonates thematically, and the ending’s restraint avoids moralizing while inviting reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fresh imagery (e.g., "frozen screams") counters occasional overwrought phrasing ("lucidly confusing energy"). Avoids clichés but leans on mystical tropes without fully subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive in tone and theme but lacks narrative urgency or emotional stakes; the story's brevity works conceptually but sacrifices depth in character and conflict.</comment>
