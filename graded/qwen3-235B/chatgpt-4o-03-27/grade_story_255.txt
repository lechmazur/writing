<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Seer's motivation and traits are consistent, but lack emotional depth and internal conflict; her "innocent cynicism" informs actions but isn't fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is tight but effective; relic's revelation feels inevitable yet emotionally underdeveloped; beginning/end connection clear but lacks nuanced escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ozone, petrichor, cracking concrete) create palpable atmosphere; setting's decay mirrors themes of buried truths; scent-as-data uniquely grounds the mysticism in physicality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (rain as memory/cleansing) and thematic coherence (truth vs. erasure); ending resonates thematically but lacks concrete emotional stakes; tension between obscurity and revelation is compelling but understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Few clich√©s; scent-based encryption is original; "bruised dusk sky" borders on overwrought; avoids emotional telling through environmental storytelling; transitions smooth but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements serve the story's logic but some (timeframe) feel superficially applied; length constraints limit character depth; thematic ambition outpaces full realization of emotional impact.</comment>
