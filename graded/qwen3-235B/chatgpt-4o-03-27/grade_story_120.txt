<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eli’s trauma and repetition define his identity; the lure bridges personal history with present action. Internal conflict between guilt and acceptance is profound, though secondary characters remain abstract as intended.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Nonlinear looping structure achieves emotional crescendo through variation-on-a-theme. Bell-to-bell framing, cause-effect between Eli’s mindset and portal behavior, and condensation of cyclical trauma demonstrate mastery of limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel as psychological liminal space merges metaphor and setting. Sensory motifs (raindrop, lure texture, antiseptic/diesel scent) create atmospheric cohesion while reflecting dissociative trauma responses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Transformative arc through subversion of time-loop trope—from desperate remediation to sacred witnessing. Symbolism (lure as baptismal token) and poetic metaphor ("scalpel-raindrop") deepen beyond genre convention. Open-ended progression feels earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors avoid abstraction through visceral grounding ("specter eyes"). Nuanced emotion emerges through action (clutching lure) rather than exposition. Voice maintains poetic precision without excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock seamlessly: quantum tunnel enables loops, raindrop triggers cycles, privately public grief contextualizes Eli's dissociation. Theme of trauma-as-spiritual-purgatory resonates beyond narrative mechanics.</comment>
