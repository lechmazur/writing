<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters possess poetic resonance but lack emotional depth; envoy's transformation feels abrupt and undermotivated despite thematic elegance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tight structure with strong motif-based progression, but pacing falters during envoy's sudden ideological shift; resolution feels simultaneously rushed and inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through vivid sensory juxtapositions of alien desolation and bioluminescent vitality; environmental symbolism enhances every narrative element.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("stars caught in roots"), layered meaning in "becoming ghosts" metaphor, and poetic circularity between beginning/end phrases elevate storytelling to transcendent level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh imagery and consistent tone, though some metaphors ("fruit glowing with bioluminescent promise") border on familiar; emotional shifts still feel occasionally mechanical.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Story achieves remarkable cohesion despite element density; each component interweaves organically into thematic framework about legacy and rebirth through layered subtext rather than forced integration.</comment>
