<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but thinly connected to "fiercely gentle" trait. Character's actions align with his grief, but emotional nuance feels underdeveloped beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent arc from silence to "leap," but pivotal emotional beats (letter discovery, leap) lack visceral build-up despite tight pacing and logical cause-effect chains.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric garden's sensory details enchant (glass-leaves, Saturn's shadows) but occasionally veer into ornamental excess, diluting narrative stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (garden as emotion, notepad as confession) deepen theme. Ending resonates emotionally, though some emotions are stated rather than earned through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally succumbs to elaborate phrasing ("whispers truths they couldn’t bear to say in daylight"). Emotional layering feels genuine, though not universally earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under excessive atmospheric embellishment. Lingers intellectually but lacks gut-punch transcendence.</comment>
