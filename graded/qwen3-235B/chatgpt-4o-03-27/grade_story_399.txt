<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorne’s transformation from grumpy caretaker to someone confronting trauma is clear but underexplored; motivations tied to buried pain are implied rather than deeply felt, with some reactions feeling abrupt or under-justified.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot moves logically from discovery to resolution, with cause-effect ties between the shard, mandala, and Thorne’s internal shift; pacing feels slightly rushed in early sections but achieves coherence by the end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The scrying room’s cosmic atmosphere is vivid and tonally cohesive, but connections between sensory details (e.g., stardust, cold obsidian) and Thorne’s psyche remain surface-level rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance (trauma as fractal echoes) and lyrical imagery elevate the story; the ending’s thematic clarity lingers, though subtextual depth is sometimes sacrificed to poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids generic tropes through the sand mandala and obsidian shard’s symbolic role, but phrases like “storm choosing to sleep” veer toward overused natural metaphors; emotional nuance is implied but not fully shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize effectively—trauma’s centrality shapes the mandala method and stargazing motif—but some components (e.g., witch’s late entrance) feel slightly utilitarian rather than organic.</comment>
