<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Begrudging guardian trait insufficiently explored beyond surface detachment; emotional arc hints at longing but lacks interiority depth. Bread paddle's symbolic duality (past/present) partially compensates.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Postcard-driven narrative maintains coherence within tight structure; portal resolution feels abrupt but acceptable for word constraints. Causal links between illustrations and awakening are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory alchemy creates immersive atmosphere: ticking brass, cinnamon-salt air, and tactile soot artistry. Timeless sanctuary contrasts poignantly with mortal themes of erosion and memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance achieved through tactile symbolism (postcards, bread-paddle-as-scepter) rather than stated emotions. Subtext about artistic rebirth in conflict with societal erasure somewhat thin.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions; time-folded setting feels purposefully surreal rather than pretentious. "Dangerously friendly" motif shows human nuance. Postcard recursion risks feeling contrived but saves itself through emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tightly interwoven elements form metaphor of artistic/soulful revival; brevity serves parabolic intent. Sanctuary dissolution-as-metamorphosis lingers as potent image despite narrative compression.</comment>
