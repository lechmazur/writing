<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thorne's eccentricity and motivation to outmaneuver fate are clearly defined, with actions (e.g., faking breakdowns, mentoring Elia) aligning with his traits. While his internal conflict is implied, deeper exploration of his emotional stakes could enhance nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pruning as a literal and metaphorical action drives the plot seamlessly. The arc from Thorne’s leadership to Elia’s succession is cohesive within constraints. Pacing is tight, though the club’s fracture feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The solar-panel-dominant city and citrus-scented orchard create vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (e.g., "bitter-sweet grit" of fruit) enhance mood but could be more frequent for deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (maps, pruning) and layered themes (leadership as burden) resonate. The ending’s reflection on legacy and truth is satisfyingly subtextual. Dialogue ("truth is a fruit") is crisp and thematically purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-formulaic elements (mapping loyalty on fruit peels, disclaimers in kerning) avoid cliché. Prose is vivid but never purple, with emotional nuance shown through actions (e.g., Elia’s silent mastery).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements are expertly intertwined; each choice (e.g., hidden disclaimers, solar panels as societal control) serves theme and character. The ending lingers as a poignant meditation on leadership and legacy.</comment>
