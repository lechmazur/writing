<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters possess distinct traits and symbolic depth, but Elias’s past lacks emotional resonance and Lys remains underdeveloped despite pivotal role in narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a compressed arc but strains under word limit—key transitions (e.g., crew’s adoption of Morse code) feel abrupt despite poetic cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original fusion of steampunk, code, and ecological symbolism avoids cliché; prose is lush but purposeful, with no superfluous description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story thrives as a self-contained parable but leans on brevity to obscure underexplored tensions (e.g., surface conflicts, Lys’s backstory).</comment>
