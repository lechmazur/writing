<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters are richly imaged but motivations often remain oblique; their actions hint at deeper histories but lack psychological depth, making emotional resonance more atmospheric than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves deftly through condensed timeframes with elegant cause-effect through the repositioned scroll moment, though the leap in Ren decoding the meteor method strains plausibility slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through precise sensory details (yuzu, rice-paper translucence) that harmonize with mythic undertones; the castle itself functions as a living, echoing character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion through metaphor (flowers/stars as communication) and subtle gestures; lacks sustained emotional stakes beyond quiet epiphany, limiting visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept executed with fresh imagery (meteor-flower mapping) and restrained style, though occasional ornateness ("ephemeral and eternal") borders on preciousness. Never feels formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements support each other through recurring motifs (re-positioning, unspoken language) rather than feeling imposed; story's intimacy lingers in memory like the promised meteor showers.</comment>
