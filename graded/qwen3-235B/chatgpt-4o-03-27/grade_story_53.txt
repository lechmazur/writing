<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rashness is mentioned but not demonstrated through action; transformation into solace-seeking is clear but motivation's connection to rashness underexplored; internal conflict hinted rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Well-structured arc within constraints; landslide-driven detour effectively initiates plot but pacing feels artificially compressed; thematic resolution achieved but emotional beats require more breathing room.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements harmonize surprisingly well despite density; poetic language justifies brevity as intentional stylistic choice; lingering meditative quality lingers beyond single-read impact.</comment>
