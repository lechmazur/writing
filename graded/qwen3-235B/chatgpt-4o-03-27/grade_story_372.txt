<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characterization relies too heavily on exposition (e.g., "her heart still tangled in memory") rather than internalized emotional nuance; however, the sticky label's delayed activation provides a physicalized motive that redeems some flatness in her spy persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges organically on the avalanche's release at the curried meal, with the sticky label marking escape routes; resolution feels abrupt but thematically consistent, though the transition from nostalgia to destruction lacks gradation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Decay-centric setting is vivid (neon alleys, synthetic curry tasting of memory) but uneven in sensory cohesion; holographic decay and tactual descriptions of data avalanche are strong, but olfactory details (e.g., curry) undercut high-tech atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poignancy arises from the label's dual symbolism—erased purpose and rekindled agency—while the avalanche functions as both literal threat and metaphor for historical revisionism; ending balances hope and nihilism without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre trope repetition through synthetic nostalgia cuisine and data-as-avalanche, but emotional beats (e.g., Juno's betrayal) default to generalized melancholy rather than idiosyncratic grief; language remains lean and evocative despite occasional simile abstraction ("shadow behind her").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel purposeful but not revolutionary; the futuristic slums provide necessary dystopian scaffolding, but the story’s strength lies in its paradoxical warmth amid erasure—more a well-assembled mosaic than a transcendent reimagination.</comment>
