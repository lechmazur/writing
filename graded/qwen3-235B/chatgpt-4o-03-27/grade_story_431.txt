<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elira's introversion and dance-driven expression are well-established, but her psychological depth feels occasionally abstract rather than concretely dramatized through specific actions or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure is coherent with clear progression from isolation to self-actualization, but the transition to "stepping beyond" feels slightly abrupt without a visceral moment of transformation anchoring the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through tactile decay ("dust clung like secrets") and celestial motifs, though the wasteland's emotional resonance could benefit from more grounded sensory contrasts beyond metaphorical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (knitting as mental cohesion, stars as soul maps) elevates the narrative, with a resonant theme of self-discovery. Ending achieves emotional closure while preserving poetic ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, though occasional phrases ("desolate wasteland outside") lean on familiar imagery. Avoids formulaic plotting but occasionally sacrifices visceral immediacy for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function well individually but occasionally strain under the weight of thematic density. Some components (e.g., cipher office history) feel conceptually rich but underexploited within the brevity constraint.</comment>
