<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character acts as symbolic vessel for themes but lacks visceral emotional depth or idiosyncratic behavior; motivations are clear but intellectualized rather than psychologically complex</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through symbolic economy but pacing falters in middle section; some transitions between digitization process and metaphysical revelations could be more seamlessly motivated</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent moss, stone etchings, and starless context create immersive sensory paradox; atmosphere masterfully conveys both melancholy and defiant hope through meticulously curated details</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Persuasive subtext about burden-sharing as enlightenment through precise metaphors (headlamp illuminating unmade choices, neural threads), though ending verges on didacticism while losing subtle ambiguity</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements like digitized journals and crystalline memory systems demonstrate creative alchemy, though some conceptual scaffolding (eternal student archetype) remains slightly derivative despite nuanced execution</comment>
