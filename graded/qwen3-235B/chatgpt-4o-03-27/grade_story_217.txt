<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks visceral connection to "underestimated rebel" trait; emotional shifts feel narratively imposed rather than organically earned through specific actions, though some symbolic gestures with the knife and cooking do hint at layered history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres to structural skeleton but momentum stalls in middle passages; cause-effect trajectory (call → return → cooking) remains logical yet contrived in execution, with the haunting's threat potential unexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's masterpiece—burnt sugar, spectral condensation on mirrors, and ghostly carousel mechanics create immersive decay; timeframe and setting merge to make the supernatural ordinary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elegantly woven metaphors (broth as memory, blades as former selves) create thematic resonance; final scene's emotional payoff succeeds through sensory showing rather than abstract telling, though some lyrical flourishes border on poetic indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unusual object pairings (ramen knife, haunted carnival cuisine) but contains occasional overripe phrases; adaptation theme feels genuine rather than algorithmic, though not all sensory details escape generic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element integration mostly purposeful but unevenly weighted—setting dominates while character trait remains underexploited; brevity serves contemplative tone but sacrifices deeper exploration of rebellion/resurrection dynamics.</comment>
