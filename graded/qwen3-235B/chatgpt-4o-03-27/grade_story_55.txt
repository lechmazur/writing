<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elion's romantic doom and past fame are established but don't deeply inform his present actions; motivation to preserve craft is consistent, though emotional nuance feels underexplored despite atmospheric hints.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and cyclical structure within constraints, but pacing relies heavily on atmosphere over dynamic progression; beginning/middle/end are clear but slightly diffuse.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting and timeframe are evocatively rendered with sensory detail; the "forgotten revelry" tone merges seamlessly with the studio's haunted, liminal space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor and subtext; the ending's cyclical conclusion offers thematic depth, though some literary devices verge on overuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Largely avoids formulaic writing; prose is lush but purposeful, though minor ornate passages slightly dilute tension without feeling truly disruptive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</comment>Main elements cohere tightly into a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances the story's reflective tone rather than limiting it.</comment>
