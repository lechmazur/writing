<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but internal conflicts rely heavily on exposition rather than nuanced emotional layers. Voice remains distinct but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies on sudden emotional shifts that feel slightly rushed. Resolution sacrifices some complexity for brevity, though causality remains logical.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers, but the witchâ€™s chamber feels underutilized as a symbolic space. Setting enriches mood more than narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphor (e.g., bowl fracture mirroring guilt) and subtext elevates the story. Ending balances hope and restraint, though thematic repetition slightly dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions; metaphors are specific and original. Some emotional beats lean on familiar tropes ('tears for love'), but overall voice remains distinctively human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically and serve the theme. Style prioritizes lyricism over over-decorum, and the short form feels intentional. Lingers emotionally but lacks radical innovation.</comment>
