<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through ethereal, poetic logic rather than traditional cause/effect, creating coherence through mood and metaphor but occasionally undermining narrative momentum within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting masterfully blends tactile sensory details (ghostlight, humming walls) with conceptual elements (vanished stars), creating a haunting atmosphere that seamlessly integrates with thematic focus on impermanence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified thematic exploration of cultural memory, with economy of form enhancing rather than limiting emotional impact through precise, evocative image clusters.</comment>
