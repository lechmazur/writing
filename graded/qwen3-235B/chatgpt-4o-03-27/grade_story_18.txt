<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations (seeking truth, longing for recognition) are clear and consistent, but internal shifts feel underexplored. The telepathic interaction with the girl lacks nuanced emotional progression despite vivid surface portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on predictable beats (the "chosen one" trope of the recognizing child). Pacing is rushed during the pivotal connection moment; the arc feels truncated by the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory details create an immersive, atmospheric steampunk setting. Visual elements dominate, but underutilized potential for integrating the city’s mechanical soundscape or tactile sensations of soot to deepen emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("veins of ink," "invisible axis") and subtext about truth/illusion power the storytelling. The bittersweet ending avoids sentimentality, earning emotional impact through implication rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrases ("tragedically joyful," "gloom of steam") border on formulaic flourish. The calligraphy/weatherization conceit is inventive but strains credibility. Emotional subtext primarily shown through strong imagery rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>All elements cohere despite the constrained format, with the statue’s transformation serving as an elegant metaphor. The brevity accentuates thematic clarity while leaving sufficient mystery to provoke reflection.</comment>
