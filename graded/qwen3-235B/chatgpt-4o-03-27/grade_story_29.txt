<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elric’s motivation to reclaim stolen memories anchors his actions, but his “cleverly naive” attribute remains underexplored and inconsistently manifested in his decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hedge maze and orchard setting provide a clear physical journey, but the resolution of the machine’s destruction via a jigsaw edge feels underdeveloped and reliant on abstract emotional closure rather than narrative logic.</comment>
