<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Corin's traits inform his actions but remain superficial; motivation to rebuild is clear but lacks psychological complexity, and the child's role feels underdeveloped despite symbolic significance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent within constraints, but pacing fluctuates—early atmospheric build-up contrasts with rushed revolution climax; cause-effect for the lantern's symbolic weight is underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Martian biodome's rust-red imagery and low-gravity dust motes create visceral immersion; however, the bookshop's "whispers" occasionally veer into abstraction without concrete sensory anchoring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (clothing as armor, rebellion through stitching) are evocative, but emotional resonance is limited by lack of specific character struggles; ending's thematic summary undermines subtlety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original in fusion of Martian setting with artisan rebellion but relies on familiar dystopian tropes (silent child, dying lantern); avoids clichés through unique methods (red-thread messages) but struggles with overly stylized prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story coheres around assigned elements but prioritizes poetic density over narrative momentum; themes of rebuilding through craft are compelling yet under-problematized within the brevity.</comment>
