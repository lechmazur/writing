<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's poetic past is hinted but not fully integrated; motivation is clear but emotional depth remains obscured behind dense imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels compressed; cause/effect between the lens offering and tyrant's transformation is underdeveloped despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Vivid visuals dominate, but the baroque asteroid's connection to character psychology and narrative stakes lacks tactile specificity (e.g., how does the setting physically feel?).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "dawn in trembling hands" carry existential weight, and the subversive climax rewards attention, though emotional beats occasionally lean on abstraction over concrete character reaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some phrases ("laughing like glass breaking underwater") showcase originality, but recurring archaic/modern clashes risk artificial complexity; subtext elevates overused tropes like the tyrant's redemption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the bus driver/timeframe device feels tacked on; the tight structure prioritizes mood over narrative precision, leaving some connections implicit.</comment>
