<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Main character lacks psychological depth; motivations are clear but emotionally unexplored. The thread-driven quest feels symbolic rather than psychologically grounded. No secondary characters to create contrast or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong narrative propulsion through environmental cues rather than character decisions. Pacing maintains momentum despite brevity. Causality between finding the thread and ultimate revelation is intuitive, though the "exalt" objective remains abstract. Resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive with synesthetic descriptions of alchemical fruit and pulsating glyphs. The endless night creates existential tension against the greenhouse's artificial starlight. Sensory details overwhelm functional worldbuilding - the mechanics of this reality remain unclear.</comment>
