<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (grief and need for understanding), but lacks depth beyond anguish; actions align with seeking answers, but voice and personality feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beginning/end connection works, but cause-effect relies on implausible leaps (e.g., crystal sentience); pacing balances intensity but sacrifices logic for poetic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid visually but lacks tactile/auditory immersion; setting's scientific elements clash slightly with mystical themes, weakening cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance through memory sequences; ending succeeds thematically, but exposition ("fate waiting to be rewritten") undermines subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s (crystals as memory vessels feels fresh) but leans on "lonely genius" stereotypes; language remains accessible but occasionally overwrought ("impossible colors").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements intertwine cleverly despite constraints; concept occasionally prioritizes metaphor over narrative plausibility, but the emotional arc justifies structural flaws.</comment>
