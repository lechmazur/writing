<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation oscillates between survival and mystical calling without full integration; transformation lacks sufficient emotional grounding despite strong opening.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is evident but resolution feels abrupt; reversed patterns and contrasts create visual momentum yet strain internal logic within constrained pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid sensory details but temporal framing (unwritten calendar) remains abstract and disconnected from narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and subtext effectively but emotional resonance leans on established tropes; theme of "harvesting hope" lacks layered exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids complete formulaicity with novel combinations (e.g., fruits as memory vessels) but contains excessive ornate phrasing and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration shows creativity but uneven execution; central metaphor resolves too neatly despite earlier ambiguity, diluting thematic impact.</comment>
