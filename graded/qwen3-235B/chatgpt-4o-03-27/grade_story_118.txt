<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Agent Lira's motivation and self-awareness are compelling, but Echo-9 lacks depth beyond its conceptual function, reducing emotional complexity in the therapeutic dynamic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with a clear arc; the wax revelations drive plot progression, but the abrupt transition to the square's resolution feels insufficiently earned for the character transformation demanded.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strikingly immersive atmosphere with textured details (wax, ozone, coded candle drips) that deepen thematic resonance, though the facility setting remains underexplored beyond its symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (wax as memory, wind as indecision) resonate powerfully, and the ending's thematic clarity balances poetic ambiguity with emotional payoff without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>The prose avoids formulaic AI patterns but veers toward ornateness in places; character introspection feels human, though Echo-9's voice occasionally relies on abstract grandeur over psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified whole without feeling forced, with the wax ritual and "sound of hindsight" concept elevating structural ingenuity beyond genre constraints.</comment>
