<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters are atmospheric but underexplored; Felix's gambler past and Professor Larkspur's rants lack psychological depth. Motivations (redemption, scientific obsession) remain diffuse, with inconsistent emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure feels loose. The transformative climax with the blueprint lacks narrative buildup. While the beginning/end contrast (gambling vs. "winning") offers closure, it relies on thematic abstraction over concrete cause-and-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensorially rich setting (sea sounds, wax drippings) immerses readers, but the tidal station’s metaphysical "bargains" remain vague. Atmosphere compensates for thin conceptual grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Symbols (turbines as "distant whales," candle mold as relic) evoke emotion, but subtext about regret/acceptance feels underdeveloped. The ending aims for gravitas but leans on clichéd "madness" tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but toes the line with brooding professors and metaphor-drenched prose. Sensory details (pitted wax, crackling lectures) add specificity, though some phrasing ("trembling fingers") verges on melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Elements cohere superficially—the tide’s rhythm mirrors Felix’s introspection—but the gamble/redemption arc feels imposed. The ending suggests depth but leaves conceptual threads unknit.</comment>
