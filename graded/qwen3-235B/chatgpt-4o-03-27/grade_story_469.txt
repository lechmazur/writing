<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character is well-motivated but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond surface traits; emotional restraint feels deliberate but risks shallowness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and urgent, but the vault's climax and sister's discovery could use more temporal and emotional expansion within constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evasive of clich√©s with inventive subversions (morally centered smuggler, symbolic key), but occasional ornate phrasing risks diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements harmonize cohesively, though the story leans heavily on atmospheric abstraction over thematic profundity; lingering impact is moderate.</comment>
