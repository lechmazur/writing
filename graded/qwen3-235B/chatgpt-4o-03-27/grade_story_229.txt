<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Consistent but emotionally flat. Motivation via whispered promise drives plot, but lacks psychological depth beyond surface quirkiness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Non-linear structure works for atmosphere but sacrifices traditional conflict/resolution. Atmospheric momentum sustains despite minimal plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Brilliant sensory immersion through decaying nautical textures and spectral weather metaphors. Atmosphere becomes character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates conceptual themes of temporal fluidity. Emotional resonance through cosmic metaphor overshadows narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally indulges in self-aware phrasing ("universe in on the joke"). Mostly fresh cosmic absurdism with minor purple prose tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elusive thematic cohesion between memory and mortality lingers. Some elements feel conceptually prioritized over emotional weight.</comment>
