<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character’s immortality is stated but not deeply explored through lived experience; motivation is clear but some actions (like ink-based restoration) lack grounding in demonstrated skill or logic. The earbud cover ties motivation to backstory well but doesn't fully humanize the character beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemption arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over cause-effect clarity (e.g., why does ink suddenly work after "dozens of failed attempts?"). The launch of the Eden Protocol as inciting incident is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting creates surreal atmosphere through vivid but disjointed details (particle acceleration gardens, isotopic whispers). Tonal contrasts (bitter laughter vs. quantum saplings) enhance strangeness but undermine emotional immersion. Sensory specifics often overwhelm coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (ink as genetic code, earbud as seed) creates thematic resonance. Subtext about memory vs. technology is compelling, though some emotional beats (final exhalation of the orchard) risk sentimentality. Ending satisfies with cautious hope.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through speculative fusion (botany + quantum physics), but leans on overwrought phrases like "rigidly flexible" and "subatomic soil." Metaphors feel fresh until over-explaining (e.g., "code waiting to be rewritten"). Emotional subtext strong but occasionally undercut by exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally serve theme/tone, though earbud cover and spilled ink feel conceptually strained. Style elevates brevity as a deliberate choice, with lyrical compression outweighing occasional vagueness. Lingering questions about immortality's mechanics dilute cohesion slightly.</comment>
