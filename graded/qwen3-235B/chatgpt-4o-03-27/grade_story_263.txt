<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Complex motivation via "reversed echoes" shapes actions well, but emotional depth feels surface-level. The plush as childhood remnant is effective but underdeveloped in conveying trauma, relying more on poetic description than psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight circular structure with assassinated target mirroring the villain's backstory. Pacing falters slightly during exposition, but the constraint worksâ€”conclusion resonates as both resolution and continuation of his "memoir".</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is lush but functional; anemones as neon signs and weeping sea cucumbers blend surrealism with purposeful worldbuilding. Atmosphere bends toward dark humor rather than emotional gravity, which suits but occasionally trivializes the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror morality, clown-eulogy voice) are striking and conceptually rich. Dialogue sharpens character while advancing plot. Ending delivers thematic payoff with "footnote" imagery, though the wink at the plush borders on excessive anthropomorphism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in "reversed echoes" and villain-centric mythmaking. Avoids tropes through linguistic play ("poet Kraken") and symbolic plush. Language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction but rarely obscures emotional truth beneath lyrical surfaces.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive execution of elements exceeds formulaic expectations. Length serves as deliberate vignette despite rushed transitions. Lingers due to unique voice and thematic contradiction between artistry and moral relativism.</comment>
