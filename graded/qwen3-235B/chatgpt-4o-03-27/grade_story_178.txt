<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (saving sister) drives action effectively, but her role as overburdened clerk remains underdeveloped, limiting depth of how this trait shapes her decisions beyond establishing relatability to bureaucratic systems.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and forward momentum, but the quantum rift mechanism relies on handwaving rather than narrative logic. Ending resolves A-plot while leaving B-plots about temporal consequences underexplored within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bioluminescent details create vivid underwater atmosphere, but "sentient coral" and "dissonant calm" lack concrete sensory grounding. Time-rifted greenhouse's decay better integrates mood with concept than baseline setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time-as-currency theme emerges through tactile metaphors (scars, breath), but emotional impact is diluted by exposition in later paragraphs. Subtle imagery in early sections contrasts with didactic ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but contains AI-style compromises: trivia-night MacGuffin feels arbitrarily inserted, "quantizer" functions without explanation, and stamp collection's role stretches plausibility. Language remains purposeful but occasionally overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements gel cohesively enough for short form, though some mechanical usage of assigned components. Story's strength lies in concept-to-emotion ratio rather than technical precision or stylistic innovation.</comment>
