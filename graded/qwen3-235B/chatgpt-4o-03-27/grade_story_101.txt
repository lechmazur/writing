<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters function as symbolic archetypes rather than fully developed people; their motivations reflect abstract themes over concrete psychology, which works in this mythic context but lacks visceral human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression through thematic beats rather than traditional plotting creates cohesion, but the compressed arc relies heavily on poetic resonance rather than dramatic tension; feels intentionally fragmentary rather than rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisitely textured environment where every sensory detail (whispering tea leaves, humming studio, gleaming pin) enhances emotional undercurrents; setting functions as active collaborator in the narrative rather than backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors cut deep (weathered hearts as architecture, parades as temporal paradoxes) with layered subtext about narrative agency; some phrases verge on abstraction-as-substance but mostly transcend through visceral imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Breaks expected patterns of healing narratives through recursive logic (remembering forward) and surreal transitions; stylized language risks preciousness but gains urgency from emotional precision in phrases like "unwear the storm."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fully integrates fantastical elements into emotional realism; brevity feels purposeful as a narrative telescope; lingering resonance from interplay between impermanence (blank journal) and permanence (timeless studio).</comment>
