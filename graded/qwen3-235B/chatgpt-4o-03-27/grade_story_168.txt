<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marla’s profession as a ruthless flower arranger is visually integrated but underexplored thematically; her brother’s disappearance is clear motivation, but the transition from dismissal to obsession could use deeper emotional anchoring. The scuffed comb as a keepsake ties motivation to tactile detail, but her intellectual spontaneity occasionally feels like plot convenience rather than lived trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent and resonant, with the stone circle’s mystery driving progression. Pacing manages to suggest a full arc in tight constraints, though the moment of realization about her brother’s intentional "stepping" feels slightly rushed. Glyph symbolism connects beginning to end effectively, but some transitions between memories and present action lack fluidity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting functions as both literal and metaphorical character: glyphs “whispering,” the tactile grooves, and dusk’s hum create visceral immersion. The timeframe of “the pause between verses” is poetically juxtaposed with timeless mystery, though its symbolic weight isn’t fully exploited. Atmosphere leans more on visual/tactile than auditory or olfactory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through juxtaposition of floral violence with mythic quest; the comb-as-relic and “blooming purpose” reframing are striking. Ending’s theme of active watching as purpose transcends cliché; subtext about inherited burdens and silence as complicity is subtle but potent. Show-don’t-tell is mostly mastered, though “polite anarchy” leans toward abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes via floral ruthlessness and linguistic spontaneity (“arranging petals like a general marshaling troops”). Some phrasing (“fox through brambles”) flirts with formulaic metaphor. Emotional nuance in Marla’s guilt-turned-purpose avoids predictability, but mythic elements risk veering into familiar archetypes. Language balances precision against poetic risk-taking, with rare purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of multiple elements into a reflective, thematically rich narrative. The brevity serves the story’s elliptical tone, avoiding dilution. Lingering questions about the watcher’s burden and the comb’s future use suggest narrative depth beyond the surface. Elements enhance rather than constrict story logic.</comment>
