<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character displays clear motivation but lacks layered emotional depth; "daydreaming" nature is shown but seldom regular habits remain superficially treated, with little tangible impact on decision-making or interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hastened resolution between rink cipher and satellite data disrupts coherence; while the plot connects beginning to end, the pivotal decoding process feels contrived, relying on coincidence over organic escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery in blending drowned decay and rebirth; crystalline domes, cursed hues, and sediment-trapped memories vividly materialize "pristine chaos," though setting occasionally overshadows functional integration into character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (e.g., light-stitched empathy archive) and theme of post-death compassion resonate, but emotional beats rely excessively on declarative statements like "Elian wept" rather than embodied tension between chaos and creation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids dystopian clich√©s through hybridizing sci-fi remains with lyrical environmental decay imagery; however, the skating rink's encoded rebellion and "universal empathy" motif border on utopian simplification, diminishing philosophical complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize into hauntingly cohesive whole despite high-concept density; compressed scope enhances mythic tone, though some plot pivots demand tighter foreshadowing (e.g., childhood skating connection) to transcend "eureka" convenience.</comment>
