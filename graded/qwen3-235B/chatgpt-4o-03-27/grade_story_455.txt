<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is richly textured but lacks overt transformation beyond internal acceptance; motivation is clear but somewhat passive, relying more on established scars than active choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular arc from isolation to acceptance, though the pivotal moment of placing the coin feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit, slightly undercutting narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with tactile descriptions of cobblestones, coins, and shadows creating a somber, haunted tone that mirrors the protagonist’s internal struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes enhance emotional resonance, particularly the metaphor of scars as weight and shadows as memory; ending achieves thematic closure without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through specific historical details (e.g., the deceased coin’s origin) and psychological nuance; prose is ornate but disciplined, with subtextual depth about trauma and redemption.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively into a character study of guilt and survival; the brevity feels intentional, using sparse action to emphasize introspection while leaving a lingering emotional imprint.</comment>
