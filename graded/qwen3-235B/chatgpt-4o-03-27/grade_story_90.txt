<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elric's contrition and rigid posture define him, and the cracks of his transformation through Tilda are visible, but character depth is sacrificed to brevity. Tilda's codebreaking past feels underexplored despite clever use.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story efficiently traces Elric's arc from cryptic tattoos to confrontation. Pacing remains brisk but logical, though Vint's exposure feels slightly rushed despite creative towel-based evidence. Ending achieves closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vellum Drift's floating spa is rendered with surreal sensory details (cucumber slices, exfoliating mud) that both humorously and atmospherically contrast with themes of hidden truths. The setting's hush enhances the tension beneath serenity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (tattoos as yarn, monocle as fractured identity) elevate the narrative. The ending balances redemption and absurdity, offering thematic resonance about guilt and healing. Dialogue is witty and character-specific.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (masseuse as mastermind with Royal Guild background) but occasionally leans on archetypes (plagiarizing pretender). Language remains purposeful save for the slightly forced "hiccuping harp" simile. Tones blend effectively.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tight word count occasionally strains cohesion, but all elements serve the central plot. The ending lingers on character growth and ironic worldbuilding (punctuation-named oils). Style balances inventiveness without excess.</comment>
