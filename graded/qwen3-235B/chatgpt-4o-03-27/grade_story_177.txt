<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic traits but lacks nuanced internal conflict or humanizing contradictions; motivations are clear but motivations driven more by concept than lived-in psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but compressed; the ascent → organ chamber → transformation arc works, but the 500-word limit strains the pacing of emotional stakes and worldbuilding density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in bookshelf architecture and revolution-adjacent tension; atmosphere is the story’s strongest pillar, binding concept, character, and setting into a haunting, tactile whole.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Potent thematic resonance between rebellion and rebirth; metaphors (mask, obituaries, ladders) are layered with philosophical weight; the ending’s blank obituary space lingers with haunting ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through surreal imagery and linguistic invention, but some phrases (“quills and inkpots”) verge on kitsch; the “lucid frenzy” tone occasionally overwhelms emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven with themes rather than forced into a checklist; the obituary motif and labyrinth metaphor thread through every structural and tonal choice, though some secondary elements (revolution) feel atmospherically referenced rather than deeply integrated.</comment>
