<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, though occasional lyrical excesses and a predictable redemption arc slightly dilute freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate overall, but some (e.g., road trip) feel forced; concise format works but sacrifices deeper exploration of key moments.</comment>
