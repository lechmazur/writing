<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is philosophically consistent with motivations hinted through symbolic actions, but lacks a transformative arc; internal consistency prioritized over dynamic growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Framed vignette structure with nebula imagery creates thematic closure, but plot mechanics are static; lacks narrative tension or evolving stakes within tight constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lush cosmic atmosphere and tactile details (zipper, tea) immerse reader, though nebula observation deck’s thematic integration feels more metaphorical than consequential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Poetic metaphor-layering (zipper as truth, nebula as soul) elevates thematic resonance; emotional restraint may deter visceral engagement despite technical sophistication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of conspiracy-adjacent folklore critique with tea-seller surrealism avoids clichés; prose stylized but precise, though some similes (“like sugar in boiling water”) risk overextension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce thematically but lack narrative urgency; story’s strength lies in conceptual elegance rather than plot-based propulsion or structural daring.</comment>
