<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character arc feels slightly rushed but is grounded in internal conflict and symbolic actions. Motivation aligns with actions but "doubtfully confident" lacks sufficient textual embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing is deliberate and coherent within constraints, though the thematic pivot hinges on a single scene’s emotional weight rather than plot complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through evocative ink-related imagery and sensory details, though some generic descriptors (“whispers,” “hush”) slightly dilute immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor (sword as a pen) and subtext about creation/destruction enhance depth. Ending resonates with poetic closure but relies mildly on telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements are cohesively woven into a thematically unified whole. Strength lies in symbolism over intricate plotting; succeeds as a lyrical character study.</comment>
