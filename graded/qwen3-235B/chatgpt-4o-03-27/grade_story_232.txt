<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but thinly developed; physician's obsession with unfinished tales is hinted at but lacks deeper psychological layers or tangible internal conflict. Past trauma is referenced but remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>PLOT STRUCTURE: The coffee-ground vision effectively drives the quest, but the journey from retrieval to temple feels compressed; logical cause-effect exists but transitions between segments are underdeveloped, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>WORLD & ATMOSPHERE: Digital nomad camp's juxtaposition of modernity and antiquity is compelling; "dire enchantment" permeates through visceral details (barnacle-crusted steel, glyph-pulsed stone) but could integrate more sensory specificity for immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>STORYTELLING IMPACT: Metaphors (coffee as prophecy, cutlass as key) are striking but inconsistently applied; ending delivers thematic resonance (unfinished tales as maps/cures) yet leans heavily on stated rather than felt revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>AUTHENTICITY: Some fresh concepts (tech-driven artifact hunt) but coffee-ground divination borders on contrived; avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally favors ornate description over organic emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>GENERAL SCORE: Cohesion is strong in macro-arc but falters in micro-details; brevity serves momentum but sacrifices thematic depth; stylistic risks (e.g., horizon's "gold line") elevate it above formulaic adventure tales.</comment>
