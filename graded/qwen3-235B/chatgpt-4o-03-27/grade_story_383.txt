<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear arc from haunted general to renewal, though the transition via photograph revelations feels slightly underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, original setting with rich sensory details (e.g., gravity-warped spoon, glitching waitress) enhances atmospheric tension but occasionally leans on overdescriptive phrasing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (steam revealing alternate paths) and symbolic actions (leaving the photo) create emotional resonance; ending achieves thematic and emotional closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through quantum-philosophical blending, but phrases like "thunder learning to forgive" risk ornate abstraction over genuine emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements interwoven organically; brevity amplifies mythic tone. Concludes with lingering thematic weight about redemption through confronting memory.</comment>
