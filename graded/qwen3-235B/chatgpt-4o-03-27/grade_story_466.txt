<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits mentioned but underexplored; motivation hinted at through actions yet remains psychologically opaque. The morally ambiguous label feels imposed rather than organically demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot arc complete but overly reliant on convenience; sudden urge to explore feels narrative-engineered. Pacing balanced but lacks tension to sustain momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere masterfully constructed through tactile details (bruised basil, tin-colored sky) and symbolic decay. The seed packets' physicality and setting merge into a vivid, haunting sensory tapestry.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery and botanical metaphors elevate craft, but thematic underdevelopment weakens impact. The ending's symbolic resonance is undercut by ambiguity-for-ambiguity's-sake. Subtextual potential remains dormant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in sensory language but occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction ("phantom blooms," "smoke like punctuation"). Character psychology skews simplistic; emotional beats often implied rather than rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion in elemental integration; every assigned component serves both plot and metaphor. Conceptual density occasionally strains brevity's limits, but the closing image of smoke as existential signal offers memorable resonance.</comment>
