<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation (decoding cipher, longing for kinship) and consistent actions, but lacks deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong circular structure (suburbs to forest to suburbs) with logical cause-effect, though some plot transitions (e.g., map discovery) feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts (suburban ordinariness vs. mystical tar pit) effectively heighten surreal tension; occasional overuse of metaphor dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Skilled use of alchemical metaphor and layered themes (chosen family, legacy) elevate the narrative; emotional beats occasionally verge on sentimental.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through conceptual twists (kinship as alchemical practice), but some phrases ("alchemy of connection") cross into familiar territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a resonant whole; brevity occasionally sacrifices secondary character depth but serves thematic focus.</comment>
