<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Elio's hunger for meaning is thematic rather than deeply embodied, and his passivity until the climax weakens emotional investment. The inherited spoon's significance remains externalized rather than shaping his psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but occasionally rushed in pivotal moments (mural revelation feels abrupt). The beginning/end connection is conceptually strong, but the compressed arc lacks nuanced transitions between Elio's discoveries and his agency. Cause/effect logic holds but leans on magical realism convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strikingly immersive sensory detail—flickering projector, "pulsing" mountain veins, "crackled" velvet seats—creates haunting atmosphere. The magnetic mountain's symbolic and literal connection to Elio's pull toward destiny elevates the setting beyond backdrop. Frolicsome regret tone is subtly woven into descriptions like "joke told too late."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layers (spoons as tools of legacy, murals as co-authored chaos) yield profound thematic cohesion. The ending avoids trite resolution by embracing creative agency as a paradox of freedom and burden. Subtle "showing" of Elio's hunger through tactile interactions with the spoon and paint overrides exposition. Conflict between stillness and creation is crisp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally veers toward ornamental phrasing ("quiet hunger...gnawed at him"). Metaphors like "whispers" of murals are slightly stale, though elevated by fresh contexts (murals as unfinished futures). Emotional nuance leans textual rather than psychological, and the "poisoned tyrants" backstory feels like a half-explored flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce thematically but occasionally strain narrative believability (e.g., instant door manifestation). The brevity feels intentional, leveraging ambiguity for poetic impact, but the trade-off is underexplored consequences of Elio's choice. Lingering questions about the mountain's sentience and mural sentience hint at uncharted depth.</comment>
