<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is thematically aligned with motivations and actions, but lacks internal conflict or depth beyond poetic descriptions of longing; "selfless" aspect remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within constraints, but pacing feels slightly compressed; the lunge action effectively drives the climax, though setup/resolve balance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (chimes’ hum, warped record’s distortion) create immersive atmosphere; "savage grace" tone is evocative but occasionally underexploited in character interactions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors and symbolism (music as continuity, echoes as connection) elevate subtext; ending resonates thematically but slightly understates emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original combination of concepts avoids genre tropes; language is poetic without excess, though occasional phrases ("centuries of longing") risk abstraction over specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances elegiac tone but slightly limits character/textural complexity.</comment>
