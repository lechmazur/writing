<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematically rich but occasionally undercut by underdeveloped contradictions; his "arms of steel" metaphor is potent, but the shift from logic to vulnerability lacks visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing excels in the tight framework, but the transition from envelope analysis to gravestone confrontation feels abrupt; the bulb's activation and thematic payoff compensate with strong structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative, sensorially dense atmosphere masterfully merges setting and theme; the greenhouse’s gravestone adjacency and organic-mechanical contrasts deepen both mood and metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Rich symbolism (vine-and-bone socket, moss-covered steel) elevates subtext; the ending’s "beacon vs burden" revelation shines, but some dialogue risks over-explaining rather than embodying the theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ("whispered secrets through root and stone") verge on ornate, but metaphors like "ledger of longing" are strikingly original; emotional shifts lean on poetic abstraction more than human-nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements fuse cohesively around transformation and connection; while the "moment when puzzle fits" timeframe feels slightly superfluous, the ending’s lingering envelope successfully circles the narrative.</comment>
