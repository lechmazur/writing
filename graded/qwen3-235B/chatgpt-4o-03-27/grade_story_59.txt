<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (haunted by brother’s disappearance) is clear and consistent, but emotional depth lacks human nuance; reactions often feel overly detached without internal contradiction or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc, but pacing feels slightly rushed—transitions between memory and present action could be more textured to enhance emotional weight within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (dust, cracked dome), but connections between the setting and core themes (e.g., sound vs. silence) feel underexplored; sensory details occasionally verge on generic (e.g., "whisper that wasn’t quite his own").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story uses metaphor ("heartbeat of nothingness") and imagery effectively; ending achieves thematic resonance, though some emotions are stated rather than shown (e.g., "he wept without sound").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Writing avoids clichés but leans on ornate phrasing ("star trails etched into the collar") that occasionally feels artificial; metaphors are fresh but occasionally over-elaborated, risking purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements, though some (e.g., "strangely predictable") feel forced; leaves a lingering mood but lacks subtextual layers to elevate it beyond its surface poeticism.</comment>
