<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation to witness grace is clear but underdeveloped; "personally impersonal" trait remains superficially explored despite alignment with actions; lacks emotional depth to fully justify decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Concise progression from entry to revelation works within constraints but feels rushed; cause/effect between elements (bees, twist tie, vision) lacks full contextual grounding; ending resolution feels abrupt yet thematically consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, original atmosphere created through multisensory details of cathedral orchard; decay and renewal imagery powerfully evokes forgotten sanctity; setting actively informs thematic tension between sacred and mundane.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (twist tie, bees as messengers) creates lasting impression; ending vision offers emotional payoff through "pure grace" juxtaposition; prose occasionally prioritizes poeticism over narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original interpretation of bees as linguistic entities avoids clich√© but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; some phrases ("uncharted echoes") feel overly conceptualized; maintains distinctive voice within magical realism framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coherent synthesis of elements achieved but with uneven execution; ambitious themes occasionally outpace narrative capacity; poetic language elevates material but creates distance from visceral impact potential.</comment>
