<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to "reignite" is hinted at but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but lack complexity; narration lacks distinct voice despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; abrupt shift to the kitchen scene feels unearned; while beginning/end connection exists thematically, the plot’s arc lacks satisfying progression within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (cracked rafters, creaking floors) masterfully build atmosphere; setting deeply enhances mood and theme; the decayed spaces serve as visceral metaphors for forgotten lives.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful imagery and subtext (e.g., "filtered vs. unfiltered life") create lingering impact; the story’s focus on silent spaces as sites of truth is both unique and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by tropes (creepy secret societies, haunted exorcist); avoids purple prose but relies on familiar noirish atmosphere without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mix of poetic prose and underdeveloped concepts creates inconsistency; elements are serviceable but unevenly weighted, with atmospheric details outshining narrative cohesion.</comment>
