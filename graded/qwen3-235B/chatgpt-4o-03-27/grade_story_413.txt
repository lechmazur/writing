<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation lacks psychological depth; transformation feels abrupt despite surface consistency. Voice remains distant, undercutting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot momentum driven by gimmicky invitation; ending resolution strains plausibility within word limits. Causality functional but unremarkable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details—the palpable dread of shifting corn, the fire's warmth contrasting with ghostly figures—but setting occasionally overwhelms narrative restraint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (scarf as "old secrets," laughter "shared, eternal") elevate theme of intention as emergent purpose. Ending transcends sentimentality through symbolic combustion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but flirts with New Age abstraction ("intention as rhythm"). Stylistic flourishes occasionally substitute for precise emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</degree> <comment>Elements mesh organically despite inherent contrivance. The pre-sentience framing device pays thematic dividends despite narrative artifice.</comment>
