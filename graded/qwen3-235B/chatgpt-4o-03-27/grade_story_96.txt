<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking self-reclamation through craft) is consistent but thinly layered; underground poet identity is conceptually integrated but lacks depth in emotional history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mythopoeic arc with cause-effect coherence, but the brevity strains emotional weight during the transition to the mirror field; resolution feels slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Enriched by vivid, original sensory details (moonflower sap, question-mark key) that immerse viewers in the atmosphere while thematically reinforcing the protagonist's detachment and quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagining mythic quest tropes (anti-climactic relic, self-reflective mirrors); avoids formulaic phrasing while maintaining stylistic purposefulness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are innovatively interwoven without contrivance, resulting in a cohesive parable about artistic stagnation and renewal that lingers conceptually despite minor pacing flaws.</comment>
