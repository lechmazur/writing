<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Renders Calen's unique trustworthiness through calm interaction with ghosts and decisive actions, but deeper psychological motivation for his multiversal quest remains implied rather than deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive three-act structure within tight word limit; multiverse trade routes concept shapes clear arc from entry to ascension, though some plot transitions (leaf-to-route transformation) lack explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Underwater decay is evocatively rendered through tactile details (silt, petrified wood), but tonal emphasis on "kitchen table wisdom" feels underexploited compared to multiversal grandeur.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language ("veins glowing like rivers across dimensions") and thematic resonance between quotidian wisdom and cosmic scale elevates narrative beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original conceptual fusion of orchardist trade with dimension mapping avoids cliche, though occasional ornate phrases ("quiet gravity of his presence") veer toward self-indulgent prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong central motif of reclaimed pathways provides cohesion, but uneven integration of elements (e.g., orchardist profession) tempers overall polish. Ending satisfies thematically but lacks emotional crescendo.</comment>
