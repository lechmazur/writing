<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lack of active decision-making or moral conflict limits depth; traits described but not demonstrated through impactful choices; motivation implied but not interrogated. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear chronology disrupts causality; cashier's register intro feels disconnected from temple climax; pacing drags during mystical exposition despite tight word count. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lunar-lit lace revelation masterfully blends tactile and metaphysical; temple's "pulse older than grief" creates viscerally haunted space; cashier setting inconsistently juxtaposed. </comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical precision sustains thematic integrity despite structural dissonance; assigned elements function as poetic conceits rather than organic story components; leaves haunting questions about inherited emotional cartography. </comment>
