<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character possesses emotional depth tied to sister's loss but blunt persona occasionally feels overstated. Motivation is clear but inconsistent moments between "blunt" speech and internalized trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but constrained by word limit—exposition on stock ticker/mother's consciousness feels compressed. Pacing stumbles slightly during revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and evocative with descriptions of decaying temple and light/shadow interplay, though some details verge on generic (e.g. "dust motes danced").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotional impact of sister’s revelation lands but sentimental resolution ("You kept your promise") risks saccharine tone. Strong imagery but inconsistent subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clichés but relies on familiar "twist" structure. Sensory details feel purposeful though some phrasing ("anxious elation") recurs unnaturally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically around loss/pursuit but technical elements (stock ticker, omniscient mind) strain credibility. Style elevates material but doesn't transcend constraints.</comment>
