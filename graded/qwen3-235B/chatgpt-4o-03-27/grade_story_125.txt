<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jax’s “exceptionally usual” trait anchors his arc, but his motivation shifts abruptly from bored curiosity to destiny acceptance without deeper emotional nuance. Dialogue lacks distinct voice despite potential for first-person flair.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong inciting incident via the package; pacing tightens effectively into a closed arc. The leap from activating the station to awakening legacy feels rushed, softening the climax’s emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, multisensory decay—“rusted circuits,” blinking holograms—meshes genre-blending atmosphere (farm vs. cosmos). The farmland boundary’s thematic link to heritage lacks full exploitation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (“voice like wind through wheat”) and resonant theme of mediocrity-as-shield elevate craft. Ending balances satisfaction with cosmic awe, though subtext feels lightly sketched.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Formulaic “hidden prodigy” beats undercut originality, but hybrid magic/sci-fi setting and uncanny doll avoid pure convention. Prose occasionally drifts toward ornate simplicity, but voice remains distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent, thematically unified parable; the short form serves the story’s briskness. Some mechanical reliance on tropes weakens broader impact.</comment>
