<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation to understand time patterns is clear and consistent, but Elian remains more thematic vessel than fully realized person; emotional depth is implied but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Premise-to-resolution arc is clear (frozen orchard reviving), but transitions between states of time dilation feel under-explained; pacing leans contemplative but risks perceived stagnation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (taffy-stretched minutes, bone-smooth driftwood) create immersive atmosphere; "futuristic nostalgia" tone is inconsistently rendered but evocative in specific moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric strength (coins as braille, trees folding time) elevates theme; ending resonates with earned emotional subtext; occasionally borders on poetic abstraction without tangible character stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally substitutes depth with lyrical abstraction; metaphors fresh but occasionally verge on overworked; emotional resonance suggested rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively build theme but lack narrative urgency; brevity works for poetic meditation but undermines full engagement with character psychology or metaphysical mechanics.</comment>
