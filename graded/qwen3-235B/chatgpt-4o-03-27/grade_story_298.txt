<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Wen's "rationally impulsive" trait feels underexplored in action sequencing, though his artistic motivation is consistent. Emotional clarity bursts drive pivotal moments but lack psychological depth; skin-morphing as performance tool is innovative but underleveraged in revealing inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cold-case method drives plot but relies on exposition-heavy research montage rather than dramatic tension. Pacing compresses centuries into abrupt revelations; final bow feels rushed given the mythic buildup. Sunlight-through-debris motif connects beginning and end but disrupts otherwise linear progression with sudden metaphorical shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-oil palace fusion achieves striking contrast through bamboo/solar juxtaposition. Over-reliance on visual imagery (e.g., "shimmered hues," "fractured dome") neglects tactile details like dust or temperature that could ground the desolation. AI-ghosts weeping in binary cleverly bridges historical and technological dissonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Performance-as-rebirth motif resonates emotionally through symbolic layering. The doll-as-fourth-character device elevates subtext, though explicit "garden of feeling" ending risks over-explanation. Sunlight functions as both witness and narrative force, with shifting patterns effectively visualizing memory's instability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Chameleon/performance conceit avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction ("whispers of dynastic pride"). Some phrases ("wove emotional honesty," "anxious serenity") verge on conceptual murkiness rather than visceral specificity. The "rewrote their code" AI reaction straddles intriguing metaphor and technical vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements synthesize into a meditation on memory's performative nature, with the post-oil setting serving as perfect metaphor for emotional barrenness. Narrative economy maximizes word count through recurring image patterns rather than conventional exposition. Lingering questions about AI-ghosts' transformation hint at unexplored philosophical dimensions.</comment>
