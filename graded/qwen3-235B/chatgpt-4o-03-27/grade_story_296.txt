<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies on symbolism (chopsticks, silence) but lacks deeper internal nuance; motivation for "mapping the soul" feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded, weakening emotional stakes despite intriguing traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (cookbook discovery → ritual meals → transcendence) but rushes the climax; cause-effect logic (meals altering perception) is accepted rather than earned, weakening tension in tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eerie submarine setting uses effective sensory details (salt-warped cookbook, buzzing fluorescents) but leans on clichéd isolation tropes; culinary rituals contrast sterile environment well but inconsistently explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (souls as maps, chaos as cuisine) are evocative but over-explain; ending’s poetic resonance is undercut by vague, sentimental closure; emotional impact relies on imagery over earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by stock phrases ("galaxies in eyes," "unseen constellations") and underdeveloped conflict; chopstick symbolism feels familiar; tone occasionally drifts into purple prose without disciplined restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements (cookbook, submarine) cohere but lack narrative urgency; themes of spirituality/chaos feel aspirational rather than fully realized; stylistic ambitions outpace execution.</comment>
