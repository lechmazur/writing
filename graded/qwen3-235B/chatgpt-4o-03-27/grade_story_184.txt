<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Minimal character depth beyond quirky surface traits; motivation shifts abruptly from skepticism to acceptance without psychological nuance; voice lacks distinctiveness despite flippant quips</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear sequence of wonder→resistance→acceptance but leans on dream-logic convenience rather than earned progression; pacing oscillates between rushed revelation and prolonged imagery</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stylistic atmosphere excels with surreal details but falters under scrutiny—contradictory physical rules (e.g., vacuum chamber containing breathable air?) undermine immersion; sensory descriptors often overwhelm coherence</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphor density creates memorability but occasionally distracts; theme of destiny vs. self-determination emerges through action rather than depth; ending feels inevitable but lacks emotional gravity</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original cosmic-flavored surrealism avoids genre tropes but occasionally indulges in ornate abstraction; some transitions (e.g., space folding) echo AI-generated narrative shortcuts rather than organic discovery</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under word-count constraints; the brevity both masks and magnifies structural weaknesses; surreal originality outweighs—but doesn't erase—mechanical plotting</comment>
