<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Characters serve symbolic roles rather than fully realized personas; motivations align with assigned elements but lack internal complexity. Dialogue does little to distinguish voice or deepen character beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Premise-driven plot relies on contrived "coincidence" (cooking class encounter) to connect to central mystery; pacing unevenly balances exposition with resolution in tight word count, leaving emotional arcs underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Visually striking grotto description establishes eerie atmosphere, but living shadows and celestial elements feel more decorative than narratively integral to character decisions or thematic development.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (chessboard as societal critique) resonate intellectually but emotional impact diluted by exposition-heavy delivery; ending achieves thematic cohesion without sufficient emotional payoff or dramatic tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Celestial quest tropes and "found family overcoming trauma" framework show limited innovation; chessboard concept avoids cliche through inversion but other elements (cooking class meet-cute, shadow guardians) feel algorithmically familiar.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Element integration strained by formulaic structure; forced transitions and symbolic overreach undermine cohesive narrative; ambitious themes never fully transcend concept stage to create lasting resonance.</comment>
