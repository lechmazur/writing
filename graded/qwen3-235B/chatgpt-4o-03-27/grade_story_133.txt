<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Elias’ jadedness is tied to his gloves and internal conflict; Mireya’s menace contrasts vividly. Weakness: His transition to rebuilding the guild feels slightly rushed without deeper exploration of his resistance to power.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strength: The encounter at the pottery class and cellar discovery are organic, driving the resolution. Tight arc from stagnation to renewal. Weakness: Pacing near the end could feel condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>Strengths: Lush, sensory-rich setting (terracotta, citrus, kiln smoke) enhances mood. Weakness: Some worldbuilding elements (hunting clans, guild history) remain underexplored, reducing immersion’s edge.</grade>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Metaphors (locks/pottery as preservation, throne as decay) elevate the theme. Dialogue is crisp and layered. Weakness: Slight overreliance on poetic abstraction risks overshadowing emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strengths: Fresh take on guild reconstruction without hierarchy. Unique interplay between lockmaking/ceramics. Weakness: Some phrases (“like old fire”) border on cliché; tone occasionally favors ornateness over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Strengths: Cohesive synthesis of elements; ending balances closure and openness. Weakness: Labyrinth orchard and throne’s symbolic weight could be more deeply interwoven.</grade>
