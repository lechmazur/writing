<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters possess distinct voices and motivations, but Serel's fury/ambivalence lacks full psychological nuance; Varn's "cheerless ecstasy" is symbolically rendered but underexplored in behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has conceptual cohesion with prophecy unraveling but suffers compressed pacing; the ambush of fate as cyclical pattern feels underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create palpable atmosphere; abandoned bay's decay mirrors thematic decay of prophecy; celestial collisions as timeframe remain vaguely connected to sensory texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic resonance in bird/prophetic texts; ending achieves thematic closure with cyclical pattern disruption; dialogue avoids artificiality but lacks deeper subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some overly ornate phrasing ("engines of grief") borders on purple prose; cyclical fate concept avoids prophecy trope clich√©s but occasionally relies on vague mysticism; emotional states could be shown more concretely.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Narrative maintains cohesion across assigned elements but unevenly integrates timeframe/prophecy mechanics; leaves intellectual resonance rather than emotional reverberation; style serves concept with minor friction.</comment>
