<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Corvin's traits of skepticism, minstrelsy, and reckless generosity are surface-level integrated but lack psychological depth; his actions align with his motivations, but internal conflicts are underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot has momentum via the slingshot action and trickster conflict, but lacks a fully resolved arc; pacing is uneven, with underdeveloped cause-effect chains in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers in the factory’s eerie decay; connections between setting and theme are strong, though occasionally veers into overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic imagery enrich the narrative, but some prose risks becoming self-indulgent; theme of defiance is present but lacks nuanced subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Displays occasional formulaic phrasing ("spectral messengers," "unyielding determination") and generic descriptors; tone is consistently atmospheric but occasionally slips into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion is strained by its ambition to fuse many elements; the brevity works for poetic brevity but limits thematic resonance; leaves some intriguing questions but lacks emotional punch.</comment>
