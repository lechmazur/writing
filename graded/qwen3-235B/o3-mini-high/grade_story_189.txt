<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Attribute of "uniquely literal" observation lacks meaningful demonstration through actions/decisions. Motivation for decoding star maps remains vague rather than being urgently personal or tied to character history. Interactions with phone booth key feel arbitrarily disconnected from stated goals. No distinctive narrative voice emerges in this tightly constrained space.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot movement via overcharging circuits creates mechanical momentum but lacks logical progression. Abrupt shifts between parsing notes and activating machinery disrupt flow. Timeframe compression leaves beginning/middle/end connection disjointed. Cause-effect relationships exist but remain superficially explained within insufficient word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse atmosphere relies excessively on clich√©d descriptors ("crumbling stone walls," "oppressive gloom") rather than specific sensory details. Post-water-war setting provides visual context but doesn't organically influence character actions or plot mechanics. Tonal inconsistencies between eerie and grandiose undermine immersive cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Failed attempt at "show-don't-tell" results in extensive emotional exposition rather than earned resonance. Recycled literary devices (whispering walls, dancing sparks) lack freshness. Central conflict resolution feels arbitrary rather than thematically satisfying. No discernible subtext or layered meaning emerges beneath surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on standard genre tropes (ancient machinery, mysterious keys) without subversion. Excessive ornamental language ("whispered legends," "monumental discoveries") creates artificial complexity. Predictable emotional beats and mechanical character reasoning suggest algorithmic generation patterns rather than human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Story feels artificially assembled around required elements rather than organically developed. Word limit exacerbates disjointed transitions between concepts. Attempts at thematic depth about knowledge/war remain superficially gestural. Fails to leave lasting impression beyond checklist-based execution.</comment>
