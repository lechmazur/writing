<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete development or distinct voice; motivation is abstract ("buried optimism") rather than specific, making actions feel disconnected from tangible psychological underpinnings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Pretentious circularity replaces plot structure; beginning and end mirror each other superficially without meaningful progression or resolution within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative but disjointed sensory details create atmosphere without purposeful integration into narrative; quantum foam/void setting feels arbitrarily juxtaposed with desert sands imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Overly reliant on conceptual metaphors ("dance of generations") without emotional grounding; fails to transcend ornate abstraction into resonant storytelling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially inserted rather than organically integrated; stylistic pretension obscures thematic focus; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful.</comment>
