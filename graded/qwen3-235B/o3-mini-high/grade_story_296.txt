<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Abstract emotional descriptors lack psychological grounding. Motivation is stated but not demonstrated through tangible choices. No distinct personality or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>No narrative progression or coherent structure. Abstract descriptions replace plot. Repetitive circularity instead of beginning/middle/end. No cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere successfully blends decay with mysticism. Evocative sensory details about fluorescent buzzes, dripping condensation, and flickering monitors enhance mood. Setting functions as literal and metaphorical labyrinth.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Overloaded with generic philosophical clich√©s masquerading as depth. Formulaic combinations of "chaos/order" tropes without fresh perspectives. Flowery abstractions substitute for authentic emotional exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Elements arbitrarily assembled without narrative synthesis. Character, object, and setting never cohere into meaningful whole. Abstract repetition passes for thematic development.</comment>
