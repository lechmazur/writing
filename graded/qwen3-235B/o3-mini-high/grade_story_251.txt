<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks active motivation; traits like "ambivalent" and "happily sad" describe but don't drive decisions. No distinct voice in narration despite introspective tone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ambiguous "plot" consists of vague cosmic ambitions without stakes or progression. No clear arc; cyclical metaphors replace narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visual atmosphere strong (lunar grit, neon glow) but divorced from plot function. Sensory details evoke mood without anchoring emotional or thematic significance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery without earned emotional payoff. Metaphors (shattered marbles as fragmented destiny) repeated but underdeveloped; ending offers abstract hope without closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Formal vocabulary and rhythmic cadences border on poetic mannerism. "Cosmic scoreboard," "defiant dreams" verge on clich√© profundity; lacks subversive risk.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements incorporated mechanically rather than organically. Stylistic flourishes obscure thematic clarity; brevity feels restrictive, not intentional.</comment>
