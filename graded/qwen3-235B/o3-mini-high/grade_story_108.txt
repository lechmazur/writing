<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are abstract and inconsistently tied to actions. Psychological nuances are overwritten with clich√©s, reducing protagonist to a vessel for thematic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks structural cohesion; repetitive imagery replaces progression. Circular return to starting point creates false sense of completeness, undermined by absence of stakes or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Overwrought atmospheric descriptors create artificial mood without meaningful context. Sensory details prioritize prettiness over purposeful worldbuilding. Spatial logic is inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornamentation suffocates emotional impact. Metaphors are empty gestures rather than narrative tools; ending offers neither revelation nor thematic payoff. Telling overwhelms showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.0</grade><comment>Riddled with algorithmic markers: recycled phrases ("tapestry of fate"), forced alliteration, meaningless juxtapositions. Emotional beats are formulaically stated, not dramatized. No subversion of tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Elements superficially arranged without organic integration. High-concept items remain decorative rather than transformative. Length neither feels intentional nor thematically significant.</comment>
