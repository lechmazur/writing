<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (defiance against corruption, reclaiming destiny) are present but thinly developed; Jasper remains an abstract figure defined more by stylized imagery than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks narrative progression; exists as scattered poetic vignettes without clear cause-effect; the "dismantling the pillars of corruption" arc is stated but unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungus and subterranean orchard create vivid, haunting atmosphere; the setting's sensory details immerse but feel disconnected from the character's internal journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ornate language creates memorable imagery but veils shallow conflict; the theme of truth vs. corruption is clear, but emotional resonance is stifled by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Excessive "purple prose" (e.g., "chaotic organization mirrored secret identities") and recycled revolutionary tropes; metaphors and similes are overly elaborate, undermining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements feel forced into a pre-existing framework; the story prioritizes aesthetic cohesion over organic integration, resulting in disjointed, self-consciously "literary" presentation.</comment>
