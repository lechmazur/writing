<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; traits like "wayward" and "unjustly fair" lack grounding in concrete actions or decisions, reducing emotional stakes and psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional arc; events drift between atmospheric vignettes and vague conflicts, sacrificing urgency and resolution within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (gears, steam) but unevenly developed; "battered marvel" tone clashes with underexplored elements like "broken treaties" and butterflies as celestial symbols.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Imagery is striking but superficial; themes of machine-magic fusion are stated rather than embodied, and emotional resonance remains elusive despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mixes fresh pairings (dry highlighter pen, Morse code alchemy) with clich√©d steampunk tropes; prose occasionally veers into excessive ornamentation without clear purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Attempts to balance poetic symbolism with narrative, but forced integrations of elements (e.g., "unjustly fair," butterflies) dilute thematic cohesion and readability.</comment>
