<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral presence; defined by contradictory descriptors but lacks emotional grounding or agency. Motivation ("to prove") feels abstractly stated, not demonstrated through action or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Static tableaux replace plot; no cause-effect progression. Visions and concepts float without narrative momentum, making "arc" illusory within 500 words. No discernible beginning/middle/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting atmosphere with synesthetic details (neon fervor, spectral power). Sky burial site's juxtaposition of ancient and technological elements creates memorable tension between decay and futurism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("shattering darkness into mosaic") and myth-modernity duality offer intellectual engagement, but overwrought language dilutes emotional impact. Ending lacks earned transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Unsubverted tropes ("metamorphosis," "fractured past"). Purple prose undermines authenticity; sudden shifts between "euphoric agitation" and "serene resolve" feel formulaic rather than human. Generic descriptors ("spectral power," "luminous rebellion").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack narrative necessity; feels like list of aesthetics rather than organic story. Length neither enhances nor hinders; prompts no lasting reflection beyond linguistic surface.</comment>
