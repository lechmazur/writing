<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lack of character individuation; motivations are abstract concepts rather than psychologically grounded, with no observable development through actions or conflict. Archetypes replace substantive characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Structure mimics a circular meditation rather than a plotted narrative; lacks progression, conflict, or discernible arc. Events appear static, with momentum relying on repetition rather than narrative causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative setting through surreal celestial imagery and tactile descriptions of the cafe's fabric, though atmospheric elements rarely interact meaningfully with characters or thematic abstractions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose employs striking metaphors and paradoxes, but emotional resonance is undercut by vagueness. Lyrical density compensates partially for absence of concrete stakes or character-driven themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Original atmosphere undermined by formulaic phrasing ("blissful agony," "celestial remnants") and lack of subtext. Style obscures meaning through ornate abstraction rather than deepening engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Thematic unity collapses under tension between lyrical flourishes and narrative emptiness. Elements function as disconnected symbols rather than coexisting components of a cohesive speculative vision.</comment>
