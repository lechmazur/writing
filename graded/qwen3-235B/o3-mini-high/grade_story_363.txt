<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivation are conceptually coherent but lack psychological depth; emotions remain abstract despite consistent symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks distinct narrative arc; cause/effect relationships are hazy, and the word limit exacerbates structural fragmentation without sufficient momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Vivid descriptions create mood but falter in integrating the secret society setting meaningfully; sensory details sometimes feel decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors ("labyrinth of time") and clich√©d existential framing; attempts at lyricism often devolve into predictable patterns rather than genuine originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack narrative urgency; the story's brevity works against emotional investment rather than enhancing thematic impact.</comment>
