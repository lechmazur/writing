<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (coyness, diabolical benevolence) vaguely influence actions but lack psychological depth; motives of mending fences/disguise mastery feel abstract rather than organically revealed through behavior or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pseudo-linear progression through time-bending feels incoherent; reversed-time mechanics inconsistently applied; cause-effect relationships obscured by dense metaphor; abrupt shifts between alcove encounters and cauldron climax disrupt pacing.</comment>
