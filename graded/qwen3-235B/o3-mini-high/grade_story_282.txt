<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are present in action but motivation lacks depth; "consciously wild" is stated more than demonstrated through specific decisions. Interactions with objects feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Premise exists without clear progression; climax lacks tangible stakes or clear before/after. Plot relies on poetic loops rather than causal momentum within the strict word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rich visual description overshadows emotional texture; setting's "dusty exuberance" is evoked but underutilized for thematic depth. Sensory details often repetitive rather than cumulative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Striking poetic techniques overshadow character/narrative logic; some metaphors (nautilus shell as detonation device) risk becoming empty spectacle. Attempts thematic unity but lacks emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("pulsating rhythm of ancient festivities") and abstract juxtapositions suggest formulaic embellishment rather than organic style. Tension between "wild" and "disciplined" feels conceptually flattened.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Packed elements fail to coalesce into cohesive whole; ambitious themes remain abstract. Ambiguous resolution lacks weight despite attempts at emotional resonance. Style prioritized over narrative clarity.</comment>
