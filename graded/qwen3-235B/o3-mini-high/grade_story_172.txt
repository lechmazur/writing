<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Lorenzo’s “unsettled” nature and accidental heroism lack psychological depth or believable internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but rushed; transitions between key moments (e.g., puzzle-solving, confrontation with prophecy) are abrupt, weakening narrative cohesion and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but occasionally decorative; the seashell’s grandeur isn’t fully woven into the plot’s emotional or thematic core.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism elevate the story, though thematic depth is uneven; the ending resonates but feels slightly pat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on gothic fantasy tropes (e.g., prophecies, symbolic seashells) and ornate phrasing undermines originality; reversed wishes feel conceptually undercooked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but strain under the word limit; the story’s ambition exceeds its room to breathe, resulting in a compelling but incomplete impression.</comment>
