<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through actions. Psychological interiority is absent, reducing the mercenary to a symbolic figure rather than a fully realized person with nuanced contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks narrative drive or rising tension; episodic structure prioritizes atmosphere over cause-effect logic. The "beginning-middle-end" framework is amorphous, with resolutions feeling arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is deeply immersive, with sensory details (shattered stained glass, graffiti, amber glow) creating a tactile, haunting atmosphere. The cathedral-as-labyrinth serves as both physical space and psychological metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Abundant metaphor and symbolism (amber, spider, murals) elevate the prose, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on ornate description. Subtext about artâ€™s role in healing emerges unevenly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes border on self-parody; overused abstractions ("mysteries," "whispers") and generic descriptors ("fragile resolve") suggest formulaic writing. Emotional beats are implied rather than enacted, with flat character reasoning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements are superficially combined but lack unifying thematic synthesis. Ornate style compromises clarity; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful. Story fades without meaningful resonance.</comment>
