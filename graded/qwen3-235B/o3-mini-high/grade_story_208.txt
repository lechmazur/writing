<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations; street musician identity disconnected from core actions. Psychological complexity implied but lacks concrete behavioral evidence or distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmented structure; "rewind" action lacks logical progression. Pacing overly stagnant in midsection, resolution feels artificially imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echoing mechanical soundscape paired with tactile ink stains creates immersive duality of cold automation vs. human fragility. Postal setting thematically resonant but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors convey existential tension, but abstractions dilute emotional impact. Ending reaches for profundity without sufficient character/subtext foundation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates: repetitive "whirring," "ghostly" motifs, and pretentious oxymorons (joyful despair). Over-reliance on conceptual vagueness rather than authentic emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Heavy-handed symbolic machinery undermines cohesion. Elements included rather than organically integrated; style frequently obstructs clarity and thematic resonance.</comment>
