<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Fragmented character traits (wild, meek, etc.) lack psychological depth; motivations feel abstract rather than embodied through concrete actions or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Scenes float disconnectedly; the child's school day framing device creates false tension with the isolated narrative, undermining cohesion within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Gorgeous but superficial atmospheric details; the ozone station setting remains decorative rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors ("embers of past sacrifices") overshadow emotional authenticity; themes declared rather than dramatized through character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relentlessly ornate language ("rife with unspoken vulnerabilities") feels algorithmically generated; clich√©d contrasts of wild/meek, freedom/confinement lack intellectual surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist without organic synergy; the child's storyline and paddleboarding subplot feel like arbitrary appendices to a hollow metaphysical gesture.</comment>
