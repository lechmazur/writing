<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a vessel for poetic descriptors rather than a psychologically complete figure; motivations stated intellectually rather than dramatized through concrete, revealing actions; "knowing naivety" remains abstract concept rather than lived contradiction in speech/behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Plot advances through arbitrary series of symbolic events without cohesive causal links; ambush appears unearned; structural coherence sacrificed to atmospheric accumulation; circularity undermines completion within constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory immersion in overgrown urban decay creates lingering, distinctive atmosphere; timelessness of fog/abandonment supports thematic tension between memory and futurity; environmental details occasionally overwhelm narrative purpose</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Verbal music occasionally achieves poetic resonance but often obscures emotional clarity; tension between ambition and fear remains cerebral rather than visceral; ambitious themes introduced without earned weight; ending lacks decisive narrative or thematic resolution</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on abstract duality phrasing ("rebellion and resignation") and overwrought metaphor; stylistic flourishes frequently eclipse organic character psychology; symbolic framework adheres to overfamiliar romanticism without modern subversion</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Element checklist fulfilled at expense of unifying vision; tonal shifts suggest accumulation of set pieces rather than purposeful brevity; thematic gestures remain superficially gestural rather than deeply interrogated</comment>
