<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are stated but lack concrete demonstration through action; internal conflict is overly abstracted and poetic, weakening emotional investment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting provides strong sensory scaffolding but becomes a self-contained Gothic clich√©; fails to integrate with character psychology beyond surface metaphor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (clover, tearing map) elevates theme, but overwrought prose dilutes emotional impact; ending achieves circular thematic resonance without narrative depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on ornate adjectives and familiar tropes ("jubilant despair") weakens authenticity; attempts at originality (synchronized alarms) feel artificial rather than inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but fail to create psychological or narrative weight; stylized language compensates but cannot overcome conceptual fragmentation.</comment>
