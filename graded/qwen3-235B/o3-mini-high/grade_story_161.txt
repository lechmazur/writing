<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character actions (orchardist skills, timekeeping) lack organic connection to conspiracy-unraveling via peacock tails; motivation from personal tragedy remains abstract, subsumed by overwrought metaphors that don't illuminate personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot relies on vague "decoding via peacock patterns" without credible mechanics; abrupt shifts from volunteering to cabal-exposés create structural whiplash; ending feels artificially tidy despite narrative fragmentation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Setting (paper airplane facility) is conceptually jarring with orchardist/peacock motifs; atmosphere prioritizes empty surrealism over immersive details; tone oscillates between farcical and melodramatic without cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Grandiose symbolism (seal as "proof," paper planes as rebellion) attempts thematic ambition but collapses under vagueness; subtext about power structures remains shallowly gestural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Clichéd sardonicism, mechanical repetition of "cryptic" descriptors, and fantastical conspiracies scream formulaic AI worldbuilding; metaphors strain for profundity but collapse into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements shoehorned together (orchardist, peacock, paper planes) lack narrative synergy; over-reliance on vague, grandiose abstractions undercuts cohesion; concept feels derivative rather than revelatory.</comment>
