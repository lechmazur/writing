<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Underdeveloped characters; motives stated rather than demonstrated through action; Ava’s twin status lacks emotional depth, actors exist as plot devices without distinct voices or reactions to the baseball/prophesy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Scenes exist as disconnected set-pieces; apocalyptic stakes introduced abruptly; resolution feels unearned despite the circular return to the mountain; forced progression between farmers market/crises without clear narrative causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Striking but inconsistent imagery (crystal shadows vs. farmers market); tone oscillates between mythic gravitas and underexplained urgency; atmospheric elements like the plateau aren’t meaningfully integrated into character decisions or plot consequences.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on vague portentousness rather than concrete emotional beats; metaphorical resonance undercut by overused phrases (“echoes of destiny,” “beacon of hope”); theme of knowledge preservation hinted at but lacks tangible human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Generic descriptors (“haunting aural tapestry of forgotten eras,” “whispers of the eternal unknown”) proliferate; narrative jumps between locations without transitions; character motivations explained rather than dramatized; trope-laden apocalypse avoids specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overstuffed conceit; elements seem randomly juxtaposed until the denouement’s “art vs. destiny” contrast; poetic language often obscure rather than illuminating; fails to justify brevity as an artistic choice.</comment>
