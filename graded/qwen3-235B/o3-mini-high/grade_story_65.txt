<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character's "slapdash" trait contradicts deliberate actions; motivation to escape death is abstract but lacks tangible connection to methods or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression - feels like atmospheric vignettes rather than cause-effect sequence; ritual disruption as pivotal action feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Etherial atmosphere masterfully conjured through sensory details, yet setting's geological instability and sacred qualities remain conceptually disconnected from character's existential crisis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rich in metaphors but lacks emotional specificity; the "melancholic glee" tone remains superficial abstraction rather than deeply embodied experience; ending lacks definitive weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Packs overwritten phrases ("brittle ether of forgotten chants") and recycled mythic clich√©s; atmospheric elements feel algorithmically generated rather than organically imagined; lacks emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Stylistic virtuosity masks structural incoherence; assigned elements present but awkwardly assembled like mismatched puzzle pieces; thematic depth superficial rather than revelatory.</comment>
