<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character's traits are stated but not demonstrated; motivation for recovering memories lacks emotional grounding; actions feel abstract rather than driven by concrete desires.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as a series of atmospheric vignettes; the action of 'transcending' is conceptual rather than narrative; no clear arc or resolution emerges within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting creates intense mood through storm imagery and lunar cycles, but fails to integrate ecological details of "orchard island" beyond decorative mentions of trees.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on lyrical abstraction over emotional engagement; metaphors like "seeds of hope" feel unearned; ending posits thematic "truths" without earning them through character or action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival overload ("ancient groves," "crumbling stone paths") creates clich√©d mysticism; repetitive phrases like "whispered secrets" and "profound insight" suggest formulaic composition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements present but arbitrarily arranged; lush description substitutes for meaningful structure; fails to transform constraints into artistic strengths.</comment>
