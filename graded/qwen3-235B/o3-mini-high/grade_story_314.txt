<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; traits exist primarily as symbolic devices rather than evolving motivations, with reactions feeling more dictated by plot needs than organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot contains logically connected beats but feels compressed: abrupt transitions between relic discovery, supernatural manifestation, and transcendence undermine narrative weight within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant, immersive worldbuilding through striking visuals and paradoxical descriptors (engineered serenity/concealed secrets), though environmental elements occasionally prioritize aesthetic over functional narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and thematic coherence around order/chaos duality; emotional resonance diluted by abstract, generalized philosophizing instead of concrete, character-grounded realizations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vividly original juxtapositions (genuinely fake relics) coexist with stylistically excessive phrasing and occasional AI-esque structural seams between abstract imagery and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Highly atmospheric but struggles to balance lyrical abstraction with narrative specificity; ambitious thematic synthesis occasionally sacrifices emotional immediacy and narrative cohesion.</comment>
