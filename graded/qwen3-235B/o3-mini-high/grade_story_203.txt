<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is obscured by abstract phrasing; stage fright isn't effectively integrated into actions or decisions, making traits feel decorative rather than defining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progressionâ€”disparate settings (orbit, workshop, corridors) create fragmentation; pivotal moments like key-turning feel unearned due to abrupt pacing and unclear stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid cosmic decay imagery establishes strong atmosphere, but the connection between orbital debris and exorcism remains superficial; toy assembly as setting detail feels arbitrarily placed rather than thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., wildflowers as secrets) impress, but emotional impact suffers from overgeneralized abstractions ("hope," "courage") rather than specific, earned character moments or narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on ornate phrasing ("cosmic wreckage," "lingering phantoms") suggests formulaic embellishment; repetitive motifs ("never usual") and mechanical thematic insistence undermine perceived originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story possesses stylistic ambition but lacks cohesive integration of elements; while imagery lingers, underdeveloped character arcs and episodic structure prevent it from achieving publishable literary distinction.</comment>
