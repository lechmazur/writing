<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character's meekness is superficially hinted at but not demonstrated through actions; motivation to harness heartbreak is stated rather than embodied, with unclear psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Non-linear structure replaces coherence; abrupt shifts in time and action lack causal relationships, making plot progression feel arbitrary rather than purposeful within the constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Vague sensory overload: shimmering coral and water are mentioned but lack tactile authenticity; setting feels like decorative shell rather than immersive world altering narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose creates fleeting atmosphere but lacks emotional weight; metaphors overwhelm subtext, and the ending feels preordained rather than earned or thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Gilded clich√©s dominate (e.g., heartbreak as fuel); repetitive adjectives/flowery transitions suggest algorithmic pattern-following; no risk-taking beyond surface-level recombination of tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than harmony; style obscures thematic cohesion; brevity serves no narrative purpose, leaving story feeling incomplete despite high-concept language.</comment>
