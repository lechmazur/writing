<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice or agency; motivations are abstract and inconsistently demonstrated through action. Psychological depth remains implied rather than rendered through specific behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No discernible narrative arc within the constrained form; plot progression is static and amorphous despite atmospheric flourishes. The beginning and end mirror each other without meaningful evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details create immersive atmosphere but occasionally veer into self-indulgence. The haunted attic achieves thematic cohesion while the subway timeframe feels disconnected from the dominant spatial mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lyricism elevates the prose but often at the expense of emotional resonance. Conceptual themes of nonviolence and transformation remain unmoored from tangible narrative consequences or character epiphany.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Excessive ornamentation, repetitive adverbial constructions ("relentless ticking", "surreal night"), and stock gothic tropes suggest algorithmic language patterns rather than authorial vision. Subtext remains implicit rather than earned through concrete detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Surface-level cohesion maintained superficially through recurring motifs, but structural integrity collapses under demands of literary excellence. The condensed form amplifies rather than obscures narrative deficiencies.</comment>
