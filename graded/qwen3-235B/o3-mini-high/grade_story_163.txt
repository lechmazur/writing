<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks concrete actions to illustrate "bitterly optimistic" nuance, with abstract descriptors substituting for visceral emotional beats or consistent behavioral patterns driven by heiress identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through disconnected vignettes lacking causal links; unification goal remains nebulous, while "detour" and "climactic stub release" feel arbitrarily imposed rather than organically earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but superficial; xenobiology details are decorative rather than integral, with repetitive cloud imagery failing to deepen thematic connection between setting and character fragmentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "canvas of vibrant enigmas" rely on abstraction over concrete imagery; ending gestures toward catharsis but underdevelops tension and thematic payoff beneath poetic surfaces.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("chaotic tapestry of fragmented reality"), generic descriptors ("whispered tales"), and abrupt temporal markers ("during the migration of clouds") suggest formulaic pattern repetition rather than inventive storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than interlocking cohesion; the fragmented structure undermines narrative momentum, with the ending feeling more like a thematic checklist than earned resolution.</comment>
