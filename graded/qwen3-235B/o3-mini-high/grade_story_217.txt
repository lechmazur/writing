<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Characters function as vague archetypes rather than individuals with organic motivations; actions and traits exist as checklist bullet points rather than genuine psychological development, creating dissonance between assigned attributes and narrative behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Episodic structure lacks causal progression; haunted house "twists" feel arbitrarily appended rather than purposefully directed toward thematic culmination; repetitive phrasing dilutes momentum within tight constraints</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hackneyed carnival tropes (creaking rides, ghostly laughter) create a superficially recognizable atmosphere but lack specificity or visceral sensory grounding; atmosphere remains decorative rather than integral to character experience</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on recycled metaphors ("bridge toward wonder") and hyperbolic adjectives dilutes emotional authenticity; attempts at lyrical prose often devolve into empty rhythmic cadence without genuine revelation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Exhibits classic AI-writing red flags: algorithmic repetition of key phrases, inconsistent tonal modulation, and clich√©d imagery stacked with excessive modifiers; emotional beats are directly stated rather than dramatized through concrete action</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements are externally imposed scaffolding rather than narrative necessities; thematic conclusions feel artificially attached rather than organically emerging from character decisions or plot mechanics</comment>
