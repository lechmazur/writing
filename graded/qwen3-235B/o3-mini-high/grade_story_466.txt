<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract archetype without tangible actions or inner life; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through behavior. Morally ambiguous trait lacks specific ethical tension. Voice remains indistinct despite elaborate narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists superficially but lacks narrative propulsion; grocery-store-to-tower transition feels arbitrary rather than causally connected. Pacing compromised by overwritten description at expense of momentum; resolution remains vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mixed atmosphere with vivid tower descriptions contrasting flat grocery store portrayal; failed to integrate mundane and mystical elements cohesively. Sensory details present but unevenly weighted across settings.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Literary devices abundant but superficial; thematic unity around memory/history undercut by vague emotional engagement. Ending announces transformation without earning it through character progression or concrete revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Excessive flowery prose and repetitive metaphors suggest formulaic writing. Attempts at mystery rely on generic ancient-ruin tropes; emotional complexity reduced to abstract concepts rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elements included but minimally integrated; feels checklist-driven. Uneven tone between whimsical and serious. Word limit handles atmosphere better than character/plot development. Lingers primarily as aesthetic rather than thematic impression.</comment>
