<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Meandering structure with no discernible arc; pacing stagnates due to overemphasis on lyrical descriptions at the expense of actionable plot development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (bioluminescent flora, hydroponic gardens) effectively immerse readers, but setting remains backdrop rather than active narrative force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Formulaic repetitions ("reluctant awe," "shattered remnants") and purple prose undercut originality; character reasoning lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stylized language partially masks lack of narrative substance; elements cohere marginally through tone but fail to create structural or thematic urgency.</comment>
