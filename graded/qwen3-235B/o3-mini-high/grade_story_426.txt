<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Personality traits like "angrily peaceful" are stated but rarely dramatized. Connection between folk medicine motivation and actions feels forced; teapot lacks emotional anchoring. Character psychology remains opaque despite poetic descriptions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot fragments into vignettes rather than a cohesive arc. Marathon training structure is arbitrary, ending lacks resolution or revelation. Logical gaps in how hacking playlists connects to character's broader quest for healing traditions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere created through soundscapes (creaking tracks, glitched playlists) and weather (rain, mist). Setting remains backdrop rather than active force - ghost train's mechanics or carnival decay could have deeper symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Rich phrases ("spectral and sacred") undercut by flat narrative progression. Metaphors (teapot as heritage) and subtext about tradition/tech remain unexplored. Conflict between remembering/forgetting dissipates rather than resolving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on mystical recluse tropes and vague "haunted" conceits without subversion. Overly abstract descriptors ("twisted melodies," "clandestine symphony") create distance. Emotional register feels pre-set rather than authentically earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements piled atop each other without catalyzing narrative energy. Lingering twilight imagery has aesthetic appeal but no thematic conclusion. Style prioritized over emotional or conceptual payoff despite inventive premise.</comment>
