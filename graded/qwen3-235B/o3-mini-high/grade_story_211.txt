<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is flat; motivations stated rather than shown through meaningful actions. Lacks distinct voice or internal conflict despite poetic descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot has rudimentary structure but lacks causal logic and narrative momentum. Ritualistic actions feel disconnected from broader thematic aims.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Visually atmospheric but environmental details remain decorative rather than shaping character actions or thematic resonance. Sensory immersion is inconsistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Uses intriguing metaphors (botanical resilience vs. corruption) but relies on abstract statements over visceral storytelling. Ending lacks thematic payoff despite lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Strains under excessive metaphorical weight and occasionally clich√©d phrases ("whispers of better times"). Spin-the-bottle mechanism feels artificial. Emotional subtext lacks human complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements combine superficially without organic cohesion. Ambiguous stakes and unresolved thematic threads suggest conceptual underdevelopment despite stylistic ambition.</comment>
