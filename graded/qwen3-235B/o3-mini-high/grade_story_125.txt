<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is muddled; "underachieving mage" lacks depth through inconsistent actions and reactions. Emotional stakes remain abstract. No distinct voice or nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is disjointed with abrupt shifts (farmland to space station). Pacing feels rushed despite word constraint, and cause-effect logic between relics and lineage is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d descriptions ("dimly lit," "uncanny") without immersive sensory details. The farmland/space station duality creates tonal dissonance rather than cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Lacks emotional resonance or subtext; themes of heritage are stated rather than demonstrated. Overuse of passive constructions dilutes impact. Ending feels procedural, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overly formulaic: combines tropes (found objects, lost legacies) without subversion. Repetitive phrasing ("bored excitement") and generic descriptors suggest algorithmic scaffolding rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements feel checklist-driven rather than integrated. The brief length exacerbates structural issues rather than showcasing compression mastery. No lingering impact.</comment>
