<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond eccentric descriptors; motivation to “outshine northern lights” is abstract and disconnected from concrete actions or emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure—progression is a fragmented sequence of abstract images with no causal or emotional momentum, leaving coherence elusive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on vivid but generic surrealism (floating studios, “granite resonance”) rather than specific, grounded sensory details to evoke setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on ornate abstraction stifles emotional impact; lacks tension, subtext, or memorable themes, with an ending that feels like a vague aphorism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Verdant metaphors and clichéd “absurdism” feel derivative; writing veers into overwrought, repetitive abstraction typical of algorithmic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elements thrown together with little narrative synergy; the story’s brevity feels like a constraint, not a deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
