<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is primarily described through abstract adjectives rather than concrete actions; motivation to overcome fear is stated but not visceral or dynamically developed through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Pacing drags in critical moments due to excessive lyrical description; plot progression relies more on thematic repetition than cause-and-effect momentum; arc resolution feels perfunctory in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details create strong cold isolation imagery; fails to fully integrate setting's unique elements (crevasse suspension, blue ice) into narrative stakes; tone oscillates between somber and sardonic without full emotional commitment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies heavily on abstract metaphors and conceptual duality tropes; emotional impact diluted by excessive telling vs. showing; thematic consistency about silence vs. connection emerges but lacks narrative embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formal language often veers into purple prose; repetitive use of "frost," "silence," and "time" motifs reduces impact; emotional arc follows predictable redemption-through-ritual pattern without subverting expectations or offering fresh metaphoric layers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Element inclusion feels checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; brief length exacerbates structural fragmentation; lingering impression stems from atmospheric competence rather than narrative innovation or thematic resonance.</comment>
