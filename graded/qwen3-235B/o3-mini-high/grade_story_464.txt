<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth and interiority; traits are described rather than demonstrated through action/dialogue. Sassy voice never emerges despite first-person opportunity. Motivation feels arbitrarily assigned rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear progression or escalation. Cause-effect between actions and consequences remains nebulous. Artificially imposed "beginning/middle/end" with no organic narrative drive or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptions substitute for genuine atmosphere. Setting serves as decorative façade rather than functional narrative element. Sensory details overwhelm without purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Literary devices superficially applied without thematic resonance. Ending lacks emotional or philosophical impact. Central conflict remains abstract and underexplored. Style distracts rather than enhances.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Permeated by formulaic phrasing, clichéd metaphors, and repetitive cadence. Attempts at "originality" manifest as arbitrary surrealism rather than meaningful innovation. Turgid prose masks narrative emptiness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Elements present but inert. Assigned components function as checklist items rather than narrative necessities. Style works against coherence. Fails to justify its own existence.</comment>
