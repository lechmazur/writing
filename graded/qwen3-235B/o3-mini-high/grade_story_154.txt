<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vasque character remains abstract despite poetic descriptions; motivation for tracking social changes lacks causal connection to actions/choices; "strongly weak" physicality and "strands of courage" feel conceptually disassociated from actual behavior</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Premise fragments into disconnected vignettes rather than cohesive narrative; levitation functions as isolated spectacle without escalating stakes; attempts to compress epic themes into 500 words collapses structural coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Superficial Celtic tropes (glowing runes, "whispering winds") overwrite genuine environmental storytelling; contrast between ancient and modern remains gestural rather than organically integrated into setting's physicality</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical language operates in clich√©d abstractions rather than concrete imagery; "jubilant despair" repeated as thematic anchor without earned emotional complexity; ending telegraphs transcendence without narrative foundation</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Excessive adjectives/adverbs ("frazzled," "timeless," "vibrant") substitute for precise detail; cyclical phrases ("strands of courage," "strongly weak") suggest algorithmic repetition; emotional tenor remains stated rather than demonstrated through action</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Assigned elements incorporated as checklist items rather than organic components; thematic ambition outpaces execution within constraints; final impression is decorative but narratively inert</comment>
