<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivation is stated but not demonstrated through action or conflict. Physical traits like "thin lips" aren't integrated into characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>No causality or meaningful progression; plot is a static vignette. Timeframe and endpoints disconnected; "optimizing destiny" lacks stakes or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Textured setting with sensory details (dust, crumbling pages), but disconnected from character's internal life. Atmosphere becomes aesthetic ornamentation rather than narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overly abstract language obliterates emotional resonance. Reliance on clich√©d metaphors ("forbidden fruits of wisdom") creates detachment rather than immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Formulaic descriptors ("echoes of lost lore," "tapestry of history") suggest algorithmic repetition. No evidence of human idiosyncrasy in word choice or structural decisions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolated compartments. Style actively works against clarity with oxymoronic phrases ("formally casual"). No lingering thematic impact beyond surface gloom.</comment>
