<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's attributes are superficially applied without deep behavioral evidence; motivation to prevent catastrophe feels abstract rather than organically tied to concrete personal stakes or nuanced psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to a minimal arc but relies on vague, poetic transitions rather than causally linked events; pacing uneven due to overwritten descriptive interludes obscuring narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends sci-fi and mystical elements with inconsistent sensory grounding; the levitation setting and crystals lack tactile specificity, weakening immersion despite attempts at symbolic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on abstract symbolism over emotional engagement; themes of betrayal/crystalline trust are hinted at but lack layered subtext or transformative character reflections.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Genre tropes (androids, facilities in crisis) are present but mildly subverted through the crystalline motif; excessive ornate phrasing and vaguely stated emotions suggest algorithmic defaults.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; the story prioritizes aesthetic cohesion over narrative depth, with a constrained length that feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
