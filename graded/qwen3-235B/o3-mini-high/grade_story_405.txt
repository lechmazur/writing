<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; "truthfully lying" and skepticism lack concrete manifestations in behavior or decisions. Motivations (lost travelers, grief) stated but not dramatized through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette without cause-effect progression. Cryptic scrawls/macguffins drive minimal movement, but no tangible obstacles or stakes. Resolution feels arbitrarily imposed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and mushroom farm create haunting imagery, but setting functions more as surreal backdrop than active participant. Sensory details abundant but unevenly tied to narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors and relentless abstraction mute emotional impact. Lacks subtext; themes of grief/memory stated overtly rather than emerging organically through character interaction with world.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornamental prose ("fractured tapestry of lives") and circular phrasing suggest algorithmic flourish over human insight. Tropes (haunted mentor, cryptic maps) receive no subversive treatment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but superficially connected. Story feels strained under weight of checklist completion rather than organic synthesis. Lingering impression of style over substance.</comment>
