<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character is adorned with affective descriptors but hollow at core; motivation to escape servitude stated yet never psychologically excavated or dramatized through concrete choices. Assigned attribute "brooding" remains superficial, a costume rather than psyche.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pseudo-plot masquerades as poetic montage; chronology exists but lacks causal momentum. Assigned elements strung like beads on string, disconnected from protagonist's arc. Pacing lurches between glacial description and abrupt declarations of action without narrative digestion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Surreal atmosphere crystallizes via precise images (sunbeam dust motes, fractured stone) but setting remains conceptually incoherent—a crater research base inhabited by conspiratorial data whispers and clandestine sculpture? Contradictory modes of reality collide without synthesis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linguistic virtuosity dazzles (e.g., "tender symphony of rebellion") but often substitutes for substance. The chiseled granite motif offers tantalizing symbolic potential left underdeveloped, while the theme of servitude-vs-freedom resonates faintly beneath ornamental diction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Purple prose proliferates ("resonant clash of water jets," "constellation of flickering screens"). Generic tropes (haunted artist, labyrinthine conspiracies) employed without subversion. Metaphors accumulate like museum specimens—beautiful but dead, lacking organic connection to character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Story fractures under weight of mandatory elements; none seem organically entangled. Length feels like constraint rather than aesthetic choice. Lingering impression is stylistic fragmentation rather than thematic resonance, impressive only to those seduced by linguistic mirage.</comment>
