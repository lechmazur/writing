<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve rituals is clear but lacks psychological depth; actions align with traits but "diligently whimsical" feels underexplored; voice is overwritten yet distinctive in its baroque lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks forward momentum; action is diffuse, with strained cause-effect logic; attempts at cyclical arc via "raucous silence" bookends feel contrived within tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Atmospheric details (whispers, magnifying glass) immerse but sometimes devolve into aesthetic excess; setting's Aztec temple reimagining creates fertile ground for ritual themes but feels conceptually thinner than its description warrants.</grade>
</question>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rich in poetic devices but struggles with emotional grounding; metaphors like "spectral whispers" verge on clich√©; thematic coherence around preservation exists but resolution feels narratively hollow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Notable for attempting to subvert gravedigger trope through mystical lens but undermined by repetitive phraseology ("raucous silence," "kindrelize") and overly mannered prose that reads as stylized abstraction over authentic voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story's ambition exceeds its formal execution; elements coexist without achieving transcendent synthesis, though the tension between mortality and ancestral memory offers provocative residue.</comment>
