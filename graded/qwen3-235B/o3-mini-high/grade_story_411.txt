<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Predominantly descriptive; traits exist without meaningful connection to actions or emotional depth. The "repulsively attractive" quality and molten heart serve more as aesthetic flourishes than narrative drivers. No discernible voice or agency beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot progression; repetition of motifs substitutes for structure. The "quest" is static, eschewing cause-effect logic. Pacing suffocated under sustained lyrical meditation without tension or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hyper-sensory detail creates a vivid, surreal dreamscape. The orchard's mechanical-organic fusion and celestial waters immerse viscerally. Atmospheric consistency elevates the abstract narrative framework.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Polished poeticism compensates for minimal emotional resonance. Metaphors ("exultant grief") gesture toward depth but remain uninterrogated. Lacks narrative urgency despite lyrical craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Relentless ornamentation verges on self-parody. Clich√©d juxtapositions ("exultant grief," "celestial artistry") lack subversive edge. Prose prioritizes surface texture over organic exploration of ideas.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Atmospherically cohesive but lacks thematic/narrative propulsion. Elements superficially interwoven; brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate. Evokes aesthetic mood over lasting narrative imprint.</comment>
