<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is abstract and symbolic rather than grounded, with motivations ("to water seeds of curiosity") stated but not dramatized; actions lack emotional or psychological specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of evocative images but lacks causality or narrative tension; episodic scenes do not build toward a thematically or emotionally significant resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory details create mood but often overwhelm with overwritten descriptors; setting establishes eerie atmosphere but remains superficially rendered and underconnected to character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Pretentious abstractions and overuse of clich√©d metaphors dilute impact; themes of heritage are stated broadly but lack subtext or emotional resonance through concrete storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival density ("spectral glow," "weathered floor") suggests formulaic decoration over precise imagery; repetitive rhythmic cadences feel mechanical rather than organic to voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements are ticked off like a checklist rather than organically woven; the story reads as a surface-level pastiche of "literary" tropes without coherent purpose or lasting impression.</comment>
