<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character remains abstract collection of adjectives; inconsistent execution of "ironically earnest" and "pompous humility"; emotional shifts feel imposed rather than earned through actions; symbolic connection to paper plane underdeveloped</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes lack causal connections; chance encounter and beekeeper's sanctuary introduced without narrative necessity; abrupt tonal shifts undermine coherence; word economy mishandled with rushed transitions between key moments</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lush, immersive descriptions (bees' hum, twilight atmosphere) contrast with emotional distance; inconsistent use of sensory details to mirror internal states; sanctuary setting works as symbolic space but disconnects from urban scenes</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d metaphors ("lost wings") and decorative abstraction; emotional impact diluted by excessive interiority without concrete manifestation; promising symbolism undermined by lack of narrative progression</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>Pervasive "purple prose" with repetitive adjectives and formulaic phrasing ("whispers of bygone victories"); predictable emotional journey follows AI-defaulted trajectory; character's reactions lack idiosyncratic nuance</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements ticked off mechanically without organic integration; brevity weaponized to mask underdevelopment; style actively impedes clarity through excessive ornamentation; thematic resonance entirely surface-level</comment>
