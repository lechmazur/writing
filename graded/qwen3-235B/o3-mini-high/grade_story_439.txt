<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks depth beyond symbolic traits; gestures insufficiently convey concrete motivations or agency tied to being mute. Cautious enchantment remains aesthetic rather than shaping character decisions. No discernible voice due to lack of dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot relies on atmospheric movement rather than cause-effect logic. Sudden comet appearance and "generate" action lack narrative setup. Closing feels arbitrary—no clear arc or resolution within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (crumbling murals, snowfall) create immersive decay and melancholy. Atmospheric coherence strong, but setting rarely influences character decisions beyond mood establishment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking image-rich prose ("silent symphony of strength," "quiet revolutions") but lacks emotional depth. Metaphors overwhelm narrative momentum; ending fails to resonate beyond surface lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on Gothic tropes (decaying opera house, comet as deus ex machina) without subversion. Flowery abstractions ("labyrinthine corridors of lost splendor") risk purple prose. Conceptual themes remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Gorgeous stylistic surface but thin thematic foundation. Elements tick boxes without organic cohesion—interdimensional travel feels appended rather than intrinsic. Lacks transcendent impact for prestigious publication.</comment>
