<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Clichéd traits and motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through actions. The tension in the character's bodyguard role is undermined by abstract musings disconnected from their assigned function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lacks coherent plot structure; conflates atmosphere with narrative. The repetitive "fragments of overheard stories" loop without progression creates neither tension nor resolution within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ornate but hollow lunar descriptions fail to create an immersive world. Atmosphere relies on overused adjectives rather than sensory specificity that connects to the character/plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Relies on hollow abstraction and clichéd resistance tropes instead of concrete storytelling. The writing draws attention to its own "poetry," undermining emotional resonance or thematic depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Excessive purple prose and formulaic oppositions ("serene anger," "timely rebirth") suggest mechanical application of literary tropes. Character psychology lacks human nuance beneath ornamental scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist without synergy. The story exists as a collection of aestheticized suffering rather than cohesive narrative architecture. The form feels arbitrarily constrained, not purposefully distilled.</comment>
