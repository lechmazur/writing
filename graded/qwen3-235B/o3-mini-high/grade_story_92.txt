<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character motivations (fear defiance, silent agreements) feel vague and abstract, with little behavioral grounding. Marlon's role as ultra-rich's dog walker has no narrative consequence, existing purely as assigned element.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure - just atmospheric vignettes linked by setting rather than causality. Sudden shifts between blood drive, mansion, and botanical collection lack narrative logic or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Effective use of sensory contrasts (eerie silence vs thunderous quiet, chill vs warmth) but over-reliance on gothic clich√©s (creaking corridors, spectral portraits) undermines originality. Timeframe device creates suitable liminality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Poetic language without emotional heft. "Loud silence" and "carefully careless" tropes are strained through excessive repetition rather than organic integration. Thematic ambition outpaces actual character stakes or narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates with self-consciously literary phrasing ("clarion call of quiet determination") and circular metaphors. Recurring phrases feel algorithmically generated rather than stylistically purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements included solely to check boxes rather than build cohesive narrative. Atmospheric continuity exists, but psychological, thematic, and plot coherence completely absent. Writing style actively obscures rather than enhances storytelling.</comment>
