<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Purely symbolic with no concrete personality or voice. Motivations are stated abstractly without psychological coherence or action-based demonstration. Lacks distinct speech/thought patterns or emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Formless accumulation of metaphors masquerading as plot. No causal progression, conflict resolution, or narrative arc. Abstract poetic devices substitute for actual structural development within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through overused gothic descriptors (ancient bulbs, rustling leaves), but setting remains inert backdrop. Minimal integration between the plant communication study and the character's actions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on vague symbolic gestures rather than crafted impact. Overuse of mixed metaphors ("mosaic of bitter memories") muddles thematic clarity. End lacks earned emotional payoff despite stylistic ambitions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("silent symphony of rustling leaves") veers into purple prose. Repetitive adjectives, illogical juxtapositions ("terrifyingly grounded"), and pseudo-profound declarations suggest AI-generated abstraction rather than authentic authorial vision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing. Short length highlights structural deficiencies rather than serving as a narrative strength. Style overwhelms substance without deeper resonances.</comment>
