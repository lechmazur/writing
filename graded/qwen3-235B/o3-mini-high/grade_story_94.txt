<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character defined more by adjectives than actions; motivations stated but not demonstrated through coherent behavior. Femme fatale traits and profession lack concrete narrative function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Meandering series of atmospheric vignettes without clear conflict/arc. Pacing uneven, lacks cause-effect logic. Closure feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visually evocative but superficial worldbuilding. Time travel element underutilized. Sensory details generic, setting-object connections tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose stylistically ornate but emotionally detached. Themes stated overtly rather than embodied. Ending lacks resonant pay-off beyond inspirational platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates. Tropes (femme fatale, amber earrings) overused without subversion. Cloud-tracking method feels illogical. Emotional cues mostly told, not shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements included but not cohesively synthesized. Verbose style obscures clarity rather than enhancing it. Ends without meaningful impact or lingering provocation.</comment>
