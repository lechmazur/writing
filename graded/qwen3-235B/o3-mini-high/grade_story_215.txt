<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lack of psychological depth; character traits are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful actions. The protagonist remains an assemblage of descriptors without authentic internal conflict or evolving motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Fractured pacing with episodic, disconnected events. Narrative arc collapses under repetitive phrases and lack of causal progression, rendering the story's coherence and resolution superficial at best.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere exists solely through buzzwords ('haunted', 'cryptic') with no sensory engagement. The setting is abstracted into clich√©d tropes rather than being meaningfully realized through specific details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Attempts symbolic resonance but relies on abstraction over emotional immediacy. While the language occasionally creates haunting imagery, underdeveloped themes and tell-don't-show execution undermine the story's literary impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Riddled with AI-generated flourishes: repetitive adverbs, generic metaphors ('whispers of history'), and formulaic phrasing. The narrative follows predictable mystery tropes without fresh subversion or distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Forces elemental integration through checklist logic rather than organic cohesion. Despite ambitious concept fusion, the execution remains hindered by purple prose and structural incoherence.</comment>
