<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's shame-driven motivation is clear but underdeveloped. Actions align with traits but lack depth beyond poetic gesturing. No distinct voice despite first-person potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure. Events flow poetically but lack causality or tension. The arc between isolation and rebellion feels abrupt and under-motivated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting is evocative with strong visual texture but sensory details remain surface-level. The cyberpunk underworld creates mood but doesn't meaningfully shape the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Metaphors dazzle but themes remain diffuse. Overwrought language obscures emotional authenticity. Ending lacks narrative resolution or thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Formulaic cyberpunk tropes, repetitive phrasing ("passionate subtlety"), and purple prose. Emotional resonance is described rather than shown through specific character experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely connected. Prose prioritizes style over clarity. The ending feels like a checklist of symbolic gestures rather than earned narrative conclusion.</comment>
