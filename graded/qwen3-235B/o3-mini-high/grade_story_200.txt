<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete actions and internal conflict; "hesitant saboteur" label is insufficiently dramatized through behavior or tangible backstory. Motivation remains abstract and vaguely connected to specific plot beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Structure exists as a series of atmospheric images rather than a progressing narrative; cause-and-effect logic is underdeveloped, and the contemplative tone undermines tension necessary for a coherent arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory immersion through descriptions of echoes and textures, but the setting’s symbolic role remains underexplored—its resonance mechanics don’t deepen the character’s journey or thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("mosaic of shattered hopes") and recurring imagery strengthen thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by vagueness; ending lacks decisive narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on clichés, repetitive adjectives, and abstract phrasing ("whispers of past misdeeds") suggests formulaic construction; lacks authentic emotional nuance or subversion of tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Attempts to layer symbolic meaning fall short due to inconsistent execution; the story’s elements—while individually evocative—lack tight integration to create lasting narrative cohesion or philosophical depth.</comment>
