<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's traits are stylistically emphasized but lack psychological depth; his actions align with assigned elements but remain superficially symbolic without revealing underlying humanity or specific history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on abstract progression through imagery rather than cause-effect logic; the candle-carrying objective feels static, with fragmented vignettes replacing a cohesive arc within the constrained length.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere with vivid fungal textures and temporal dissonance; the mushroom house’s living walls and luminescence masterfully externalize the protagonist’s mental state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (vectorized hope, ticking watches as compass) suggest intellectual ambition, but the story’s abstract tone prioritizes aesthetics over emotional catharsis or thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overreliance on elaborate, repetitive phrasing ("comfortingly pessimistic," "distorted recollections") and surreal yet hollow symbolism; lacks human-specific insights beneath stylized imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Formidable atmospheric cohesion but feels like a loosely threaded sequence of poetic fragments; assigned elements strain under the weight of excessive abstraction rather than organic integration.</comment>
