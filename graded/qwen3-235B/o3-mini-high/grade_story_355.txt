<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's aloofness and 'harsh compassion' are conceptually present but lack psychological complexity; motivations feel abstract rather than organically derived from tangible emotional stakes or concrete backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum, creating a lyrical vignette rather than a cohesive plot; lacks discernible conflict or character transformation despite thematic ambitions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Successfully synthesizes most assigned elements but prioritizes atmospheric cohesion over narrative necessity; leaves impressionistic residue rather than narrative permanence.</comment>
