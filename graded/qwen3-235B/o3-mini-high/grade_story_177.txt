<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation; rebelliousness is stated but not convincingly demonstrated through concrete actions or emotional stakes. Character remains abstract, with no distinct narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Labyrinthine progression lacks clear arc or resolution; the "manifest" action is vague. Pacing is meandering, with disjointed cause-effect relationships and abrupt shifts between motifs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (whispering books, resonant pipe organ) create immersive atmosphere. However, setting elements like the giant's bookshelf aren't fully integrated with character motivations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uses recurring symbols effectively, but lacks emotional depth. Ending feels arbitrary, not earned; themes are broadly gestured at rather than deeply explored through character or plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on clich√©d poeticisms ("labyrinth of choices," "fading glow of twilight") and overwrought metaphors. Sensory details are vivid but feel like checklist items rather than organic expressions of the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially without cohesive narrative purpose. Length emphasizes fragmentation over impact; no lingering resonance beyond atmospheric fragments.</comment>
