<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lacks concrete character psychology; motivation is abstract but not emotionally grounded or tested through conflict. Actions don't reveal layered personality, just repetitive ritualized behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Static plot with no narrative arc or momentum; poetic imagery replaces structured cause-effect progression. Beginning and end are indistinguishable, feeling like disjointed vignettes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylized, haunting atmosphere with rich synesthetic contrasts (digital decay vs. tactile relics). The surreal setting is vividly rendered but occasionally overwhelms narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Uses potent symbolism (measuring tape as temporal bridge) but lacks emotional stakes or narrative tension. Metaphors overshadow character/story progression; poetic craft elevates but doesn't fully compensate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Florid prose borders on self-parody with excessive qualifiers ("fruitlessly patient jubilant remorse"). Some fresh ideas (virtual mourning rituals) but undercut by repetitive phrase structures and ornate detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Technical cohesion exists, but lacks narrative urgency or clear artistic thesis. The style dominates rather than serving a purposeful story; emotional resonance remains intellectualized, not visceral.</comment>
