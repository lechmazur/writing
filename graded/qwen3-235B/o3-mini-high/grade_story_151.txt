<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains static and abstract, serving more as a thematic vehicle than a fleshed entity; motivation exists conceptually but lacks emotional depth or nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Circular structure exists but lacks traditional progression; events flow impressionistically but lack cause-effect momentum; word limit exacerbates structural thinness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive atmosphere with vivid, original imagery; some elements (shifting ice floes, auroras) amplify tone, though object-setting connection sometimes tenuous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic density and lyrical prose, but abstract conflicts dilute emotional impact; ending provides thematic resonance rather than narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional overwritten descriptions; fresh metaphors compete with occasionally formulaic phrasing; emotional subtext hinted but not fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cohesive in its poetic logic but struggles with conceptual overabundance; length amplifies stylistic beauty while exposing narrative minimalism; thought-provoking but unevenly impactful.</comment>
