<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Inconsistent link between 'careful poisoner' and plot actions; motivation to 'test gravity' feels abstract. Inner conflict of 'innocently guilty' lacks depth beyond vague description. Character voice indistinct despite poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt concept mentioned repetitively but lacks concrete progression. Cause-effect between clues remains unconnected. Pacing stalls on descriptions; no clear resolution to challenge despite metaphorical parallels to skateboarding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative contrasts between museum's static decay and skateboarders' motion. Sensory details (cracked hilt's "dulled silver," "whispers") create vivid atmosphere, but skateboarding's timeframe integration feels superficial rather than thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Overuse of phrases like "cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt" suggests formulaic repetition. Excessive metaphors ("language of its own," "vibrant threads") without concrete manifestation. Toned-down emotional subtext feels like stated abstraction rather than demonstrated depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elements present but inertly assembled. The scavenger hunt, poisoner identity, and skateboarding remain parallel rather than intersecting. Lyrical prose distracts from lack of narrative momentum or resonant thematic synthesis.</comment>
