<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "chameleon" trait is underexplored, motivation stated more than demonstrated through concrete action. Emotional honesty in illusions remains abstract, though the rationally impulsive conflict frames decision-making sequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity (palace as stage) but suffers compressed pacing in middle sections. Cause-effect (dress → cold-case exploration → revelation) is logical but feels narratively rushed due to ambitious scope within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting's fusion of decayed grandeur and futuristic remnants creates evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (sunlight on mosaics, rusted statue textures) effectively anchor anxious serenity through tactile contrasts between ruin and ephemeral beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphoric layers (palace as performance space, doll's dress as lost innocence) succeed, but emotional resonance uneven—some passages border on poetic abstraction rather than visceral impact. Closing image powerfully merges temporal layers through physical performance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate description ("recycled sorrow of the tattered doll's dress") that prioritizes lyricism over narrative momentum. Subtler psychological nuance would strengthen character authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly: some (doll’s dress, sunlight) are organically integrated while timeframe/oil extraction feels extrinsic. Story's ambition to conflate temporal collapse is compelling but unevenly realized within constraints.</comment>
