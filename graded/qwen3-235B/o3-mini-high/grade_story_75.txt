<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite poetic descriptors; motivations are declared rather than dramatized through decisions or evolution. Assigned attribute creates contradiction without tangible consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of abstract revelations without clear stakes or progression. Cryptic transitions and lack of cause-effect muddy cohesion. Concept dominates over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting relies on overused sci-fi/fantasy tropes ("nano-forest") without functional integration. Atmosphere is aesthetic rather than immersive; sensory details are sparse and generalized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Over-reliance on abstract language dilutes emotional impact. Metaphors (angry peace, grassroots defiance) lack concrete embodiment. Ending feels arbitrary, not earned through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Language veers into purple prose with repetitive abstractions. Reliance on oxymoronic phrases ("skeptically credulous") and thematic juxtapositions suggests forced depth rather than organic innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elements exist in isolated compartments without true synthesis. Length exacerbates disjointedness; thematic ideas float without narrative grounding. Style obscures rather than enhances substance.</comment>
