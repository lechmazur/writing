<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Marla's "feisty" nature and intellectual playfulness are superficially mentioned but rarely demonstrated through concrete actions; motivations are stated rather than earned, weakening character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Lacks a traditional plot structure; coherence relies on lyrical repetition rather than cause-effect progression or resolution, feeling more like a vignette than a complete narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid, cosmic-antique juxtaposition creates a haunting atmosphere, but sensory details occasionally lean into excessive abstraction rather than grounded immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pretty prose but thin on emotional stakes or subtext; themes of preservation are stated overtly rather than emerging organically from imagery or action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing (“shimmering fragments of abandoned satellites kindled visions”) borders on purple prose; metaphors feel recycled rather than freshly observed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synergy; ambitious in scope but feels directionless, prioritizing aesthetics over narrative cohesion.</comment>
