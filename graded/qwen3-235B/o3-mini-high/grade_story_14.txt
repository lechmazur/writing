<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character's naivety is stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions or decisions; motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded; reactions to objects and concepts remain vague rather than revealing specific traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; circular progression replaces narrative drive; abrupt temporal shifts create disorientation rather than cohesion; the thread between opening and closing moments exists but lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but often generic - employs Gothic tropes without subversion; sensory details impress superficially but lack specific contextual uniqueness; setting's industrial/technological elements underutilized; tone frequently substitutes melodrama for authentic mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional engagement is inconsistent - while lyrical passages evoke transient feeling, deeper resonance is undercut by vagueness; thematic elements about risk/fate are present but underdeveloped; writing style alternates between effective metaphors and overwritten banality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Exhibits classic hallmarks of formulaic construction: excessive abstract descriptors, repetitive somber-yet-mystical imagery, emotionally incoherent transitions; metaphors function surface-level rather than revealing hidden connections; attempts at profundity often reduce to clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synthesis; length exposes underdeveloped throughlines; occasional striking phrases contrast with structural flabbiness; memorable moments lack narrative anchoring; thematic ambition outpaces actualized execution.</comment>
