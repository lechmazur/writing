<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a vessel for poetic imagery; motivations are abstract but not psychologically grounded. The mortician profession and curiosity are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful action or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into recurring symbolic imagery; lacks causal progression or meaningful stakes. The bracelet discovery initiates movement but fails to catalyze coherent narrative momentum within constrained scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rich sensory detailing creates immersive twilight mangrove atmosphere. Singing spirits and ephemeral footprints contribute to mystical ambiance, though environmental elements occasionally overwhelm narrative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and rhythmic prose cannot mask underdeveloped emotional resonance. The "loudly serene" tonal contradiction and cycle-of-life-death themes are promising but remain conceptually vague.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overuse of oxymoronic phrases ("polite anarchy") and excessive alliteration creates artificiality. Atmospheric details feel archetypal rather than fresh; emotional beats are described rather than embodied through specific character experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Excessive adherence to assigned elements results in mosaic of loosely connected poetic concepts. While atmosphere lingers, the narrative fails to cohere into something greater than its atmospheric components within the limited word count.</comment>
