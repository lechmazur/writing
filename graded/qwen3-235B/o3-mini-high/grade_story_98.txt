<question>1</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract archetype without emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or conflicts; assigned attribute "intimately distant" misapplied as a concept rather than a psychological trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot drifts more than progresses with repetitive circular descriptions; cause/effect between actions (studying carvings) and outcomes (wisdom revelation) unconvincingly abstract; abrupt resolution lacks earned transformation; fragmented vignettes undermine narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create immersive, mythic atmosphere with torchlight/shadow interplay and tactile stone descriptions; contrast between outside dog sounds and chamber's mystery intriguingly dissonant; setting functions as character itself through echoing legends.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasionally striking metaphors ("mosaic of fractured light") undercut by overused archetypal phrases; theme of security through wisdom hinted but underdeveloped; ending attempts transcendence but feels formulaic rather than earned; tension remains intellectual, not visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dog walking dissonance and tapestry-as-method contrivance suggest structural formulaicity; plastic ruler's symbolic potential wasted in narrative periphery; atmospheric details often generic ("cryptic carvings") rather than specific; prose oscillates between stilted formality and purple-prose excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Element integration feels like checklist fulfillment rather than organic creation; tapestry method and dog timekeeping particularly jarring; brevity serves neither character nor plot; lingering impression is of stylistic posing rather than thematically significant storytelling.</comment>
