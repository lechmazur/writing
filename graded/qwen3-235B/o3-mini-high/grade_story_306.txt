<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Potential for depth exists, but traits are stated rather than demonstrated through coherent actions; motivations feel symbolic rather than organically human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Abstract progression from map to chamber to revelation lacks concrete cause-effect; compressed arc feels more thematic than narrative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements co-exist cosmetically rather than synergistically; ambitious brevity struggles to balance depth with density, sacrificing narrative propulsion.</comment>
