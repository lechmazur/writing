<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (collective healing/promise) remains abstract without concrete actions; timid demeanor isn't clearly demonstrated through specific behaviors; reactions to objects lack personal revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Cause-effect logic collapses (consulting scoreboard to heal community feels arbitrary); circular narrative lacks clear arc progression; pacing drags due to diffuse focus; coherence sacrificed to shoehorn elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Visually striking contrast between temple and industrial elements; sensory details present but uneven (marble/ivy strong, factory's sensory decay underdeveloped); atmosphere occasionally transcends plot weaknesses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on stated emotions ("resilience", "hope") rather than earned emotional engagement; weak central conflict; poetic language doesn't compensate for lack of thematic depth or narrative propulsion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Overstuffed with generic poetic devices; repetitive abstract adjectives ("ancient", "tender"); disjointed transitions typical of algorithmic writing; metaphors feel decorative rather than conceptually integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elements superficially connected rather than organically developed; style dominates substance; length exacerbates structural fractures; thematic residue exists but lacks narrative sustenance.</comment>
