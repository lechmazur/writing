<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character is symbolic rather than fully realized; motivations (to tame darkness) are stated but not sufficiently demonstrated through specific actions. Contradictory traits (jovial vs. indifferent) undermine consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Alludes to progression but lacks cause-effect, clear arc, or momentum. Scenes transition via abstract reflection rather than narrative function, rendering structure amorphous within the tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Evocative but inconsistent details (metronome, attic clutter) create ambiance but often feel disconnected from character actions. Timeframe (departing train) is underutilized and tonally ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors ("shimmered like fragments of light") and abstract philosophical musings rather than concrete emotional or psychological engagement. The ending recycles platitudes about hope without earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on ornate abstraction ("bittersweet rhythm of the human condition"), repetitive phrasing, and clich√©d duality concepts (light vs. darkness) suggest formulaic patterns. Emotional subtext is stated, not built into actions or interactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements function more as checklist items than integrated components. The narrow scope doesn't feel intentional but restrictive, undermining thematic depth. Lingering impressions stem from poetic language, not sustained narrative impact.</comment>
