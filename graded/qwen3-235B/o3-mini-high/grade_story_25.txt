<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Lacks coherent motivation; traits like "coldly intense" exist as labels without emotional or behavioral grounding; actions disconnected from defined motivations; no distinct voice emerges in narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Plot fragments lack causal linkage; arbitrary shifts between forest/theater; no discernible arc or resolution; pacing meanders with no sense of direction or payoff within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Some vivid visual details (ultraviolet hues) but uneven sensory coverage; atmospheric elements exist superficially without integrating into narrative logic or character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d metaphors and abstract phrases ("embers of resolve") without emotional payoff; no tangible conflict or theme development; ending lacks purpose or resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Excessive, repetitive ornateness ("spectral woodland," "liberating agony") feels formulaic; characters and plot mechanics lack human nuance; predictable emotional descriptors without subtext; generic atmospheric details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements haphazardly included with no narrative synergy; style prioritizes decoration over clarity; length exposes fragmentation rather than creating deliberate brevity; lacks enduring impact.</comment>
