<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; lacks distinct voice or emotional nuance despite descriptive elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists solely as fragmented vignettes; abstract progression lacks causal logic, definable structure, or resolution within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eerie, decaying setting vividly rendered through evocative sensory details; atmosphere of melancholy and defiance immerses the reader despite narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language and thematic consistency around imperfection stand out, but emotional impact is diluted by vague storytelling and lack of dramatic tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Visually original but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing ("beauty of imperfection," "angry peace"), inconsistent tone shifts, and reliance on obscure, stylized prose over meaningful innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements function as stylistic embellishments rather than narrative drivers; coherence struggles under weight of excessive abstraction but raises provocative philosophical questions.</comment>
