<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Presentation of Arthur’s spinelessness mostly told rather than shown. Motivation of silencing a coded prophecy lacks psychological depth. Actions occasionally belie his supposed cowardice, undermining consistency. Minimal distinct voice in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fragmented structure with abrupt time jumps. Assigned action (mentoring) barely propels plot. Coherence between beginning and end is forced. Pacing feels rushed due to word limit, losing cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic descriptions like “luminous doubt” create artificial atmosphere. Sensory details are generic, over-reliant on visual cues. Setting (map projection room) visually rendered but disconnected from character experience or plot function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overuse of clichéd metaphors (“inner flame of valor”) dilutes impact. No memorable narrative perspective. Ending resolves too neatly, avoiding complexity. Central conflict remains abstract, lacking visceral tension or thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (redemptive arcs, forbidden vaults) without subversion. Purple prose dominates (“reimagined future,” “whispered clandestine hopes”). Stated emotions dominate; AI-like redundancy in descriptors (“fractured,” “time-worn”). Predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated. Style emphasizes ornate abstraction over clarity. Length highlights underdevelopment rather than deliberate economy. Themes are superficially stated, not thematically woven.</comment>
