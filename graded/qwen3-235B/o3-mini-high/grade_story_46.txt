<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character lacks identifiable traits beyond assigned attributes; motivations remain abstract and unexplored; reactions to objects/concepts are purely symbolic rather than psychologically grounded; no distinct narrative voice emerges.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Narrative lacks causal progression or meaningful stakes; plot events appear as disconnected poetic images; no coherent arc or resolution within constraints; pacing is stagnant; logical connections between key elements are absent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting creates vivid, immersive atmosphere through consistent sensory motifs; lush descriptions reinforce thematic concerns; however, environment often overshadows narrative purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relentlessly formulaic language patterns suggest mechanical generation; repetitive phrase structures ("hauntingly silent and uniquely typical," "precise madness and beckoning visions"); overused adjectives/adverbs create artificial depth; predictable mystical tropes without subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elements present as checklist items rather than organic components; stylized language compensates for lack of narrative clarity; length feels restrictive rather than purposeful; fails to synthesize assigned elements into meaningful whole.</comment>
