<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivations implied but not concretely demonstrated through meaningful actions or decisions. Wryness and aloofness exist as descriptors without deep narrative integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of disconnected poetic images with unclear causal links. Some cyclical structure but lacks coherent progression or satisfying resolution for key elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting provides visual texture with space pirates and neon panels, but fails to create functional worldbuilding that interacts meaningfully with plot or character. Sensory details often decorative rather than integrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rich poetic language and thematic ambition undercut by overreliance on abstract metaphors. While tone creates atmosphere, emotional resonance remains superficial through tell-not-show patterns rather than organic character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Excessive purple prose, repetitive cosmic and temporal clich√©s, and formulaic transitions suggest algorithmic default patterns. Attempts at profundity through abstraction fail to compensate for lack of grounded emotional authenticity or unexpected narrative choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative coherence hinges on aesthetic cohesion rather than organic element integration. Some lingering atmosphere, but forced connections between plot mechanics (chalk/vanishing) and philosophical themes undermine overall impact.</comment>
