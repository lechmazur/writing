<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Raised by surface-level melancholy, but lacks depth in motivation consistency and distinct voice. Assigned traits (melancholy, iconically unintentional) are inconsistently manifested.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette but lacks cause-effect logic and structural completion. Assigned action (command) drives vague gestures rather than concrete progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine offers rich texture but underutilizes sensory specifics. Atmosphere aligns with crooked hope but fails to integrate timeframe's narrative potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mix of poetic imagery ("bittersweet symphony") and abstract introspection creates impact, though emotional resonance remains surface-bound. Central theme (revival) is clear but under-dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on ornate pseudo-literary phrasing ("iconically unintentional") and disconnected metaphors suggests formulaic construction. Tea leaves motif feels absurdly artificial rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements combined through forced adjacency rather than organic fusion. Story uses brevity as limitation rather than strength, failing to crystallize its thematic ambitions.</comment>
