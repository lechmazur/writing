<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation and traits like feisty spirit are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. Grimoire's influence feels superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is rushed; mystical barricade inciting incident lacks payoff. Pacing uneven, closure feels arbitrary. Arc is simplified, coherence disrupted by vague transitions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Excessive metaphorical language verges on purple prose. Predictable tropes (ancient grimoire, exorcist's burden) lack subversion. Sudden narrative shifts resemble AI formulaic transitions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven; setting dominates over plot. Length amplifies underdevelopment. Memorable imagery but insufficient narrative momentum or thematic payoff.</comment>
