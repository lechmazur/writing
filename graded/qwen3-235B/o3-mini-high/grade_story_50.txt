<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, lacks distinct voice or active agency. Internal conflict isn't clearly motivated or manifested through concrete actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure; events meander without cause-effect. Elements present but narrative arc absent within tight constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create vivid atmosphere. Glass desert and monarch butterfly enhance mood, though symbolic weight occasionally over-decorated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong symbolic language and imagery, but emotional resonance undermined by vague character psychology and static tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors diluted by excessive adjectives and abstract phrasing. Premise original, but execution veers toward ornate self-parody characteristic of formulaic poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements crammed into narrative without cohesive integration. Style dominates substance; thematic depth superficial despite atmospheric density.</comment>
