<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character is abstract and symbolic rather than fully realized; motivations are implied through fragmented actions that don't consistently cohere around noble status or "candor in small moments."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lacks clear narrative arc or resolution; disjointed progression between abstract concepts rather than causal plot development; feels like fragmented vignettes without cumulative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; setting details (combustion lab, drone) create mood but fail to meaningfully integrate with character or theme; sensory details often ornamental rather than functional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on abstract metaphor over concrete storytelling; theme of redemption remains surface-level; lacks emotional resonance or subtext despite ornate language; ending feels contrived without earned impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overly reliant on florid prose and conceptual vagueness; repetitive phrasing ("volatile energies," "hollow recklessness") suggests formulaic construction; fails to subvert tropes (fallen noble, hidden truths) with specific, human nuances.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements are superficially incorporated but not organically integrated; tone leans on grandiosity rather than disciplined vision; brevity undercuts deeper thematic exploration, feels constrained rather than purposeful.</comment>
