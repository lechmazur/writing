<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's contradictory traits (cautious/meticulously impulsive) lack meaningful exploration; motivation toward empathy remains abstract and unearned. Actions disconnected from stated traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmented structure with arbitrary scenes; no clear narrative arc or cause-effect progression. Prediction as central action remains inert, unresolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric but generic "drought" imagery dominates; setting functions as backdrop rather than integral force. Sensory details lack specificity and emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on empty poetic abstraction rather than substantive literary devices; no emotional impact. Central conflict/theme remains undefined. Passive "telling" over active engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>Purple prose abounds with clich√©d metaphors and oxymoronic descriptors. Predictable genre tropes (smugglers, droughts) paired with AI-style narrative dissonance and inconsistent logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Elements exist independently rather than cohesively; forced juxtaposition of smuggler, butterflies, drought. Prose prioritizes style over substance; no lingering resonance.</comment>
