<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is abstract and consistent, but lacks concrete personality traits or evolution; inner conflict is stated rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from entry to resolution, but pacing leans too heavily on atmospheric description at the expense of dynamic plot development; cause-effect logic is implied rather than tightly engineered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by repetitive, ornate phrasing that verges on purple prose; emotional states are abstractly stated rather than revealed through nuanced subtext or action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists thematically, but the storyâ€™s brevity restricts meaningful exploration of its sprawling concepts; ambition outpaces execution.</comment>
