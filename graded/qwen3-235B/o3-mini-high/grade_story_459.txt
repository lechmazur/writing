<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks actionable motivation beyond vague "letting go," with traits like "elegantly clumsy" and ghost-seeing presented descriptively rather than shaping behavior. Emotional connections between object (flower crown) and grief remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as disconnected vignettes without causality. Circular structure (lab bookends) feels artificial, and the "liberation" resolution emerges abruptly without earned progression. Timeframe compression paradoxically creates both stagnation and rushed emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elevated language creates mood but obscures tangible reality. Sensory details (e.g., "sandy relics") remain generic rather than specific to sand-castle preservation logic. Ghostly ambiance feels imported rather than organically arising from setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("tapestry of memories") and motifs show surface cleverness but lack substantive resonance. Attempts at thematic depth (impermanence, silence's duality) remain abstract rather than dramatizing through character decisions or tangible consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on poetic abstraction ("muted mysteries," "bittersweet chord") borders on purple prose. Mechanical/haunted setting combination shows potential but falls into Gothic clich√©s. Emotions are stated rather than embodied through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>High-concept elements crammed together without synthesizing. The ending's catharsis feels manufactured through authorial fiat rather than earned narrative progression. Stylistic ambition exceeds execution, leaving the impression of style overshadowing substance.</comment>
