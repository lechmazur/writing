<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite assigned traits; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior or internal conflict. Transformation feels imposed rather than earned, lacking emotional depth or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot structure exists as poetic vignette rather than cohesive narrative; action is repetitive rather than progressive, with tenuous connections between discovery of ticket and character's realization. Resolution feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting relies on overused science fiction tropes without fresh interpretation; warped space/time creates atmosphere but lacks concrete sensory grounding. Tone of "affectionate detachment" creates dissonance with urgent thematic message, weakening immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies excessively on abstract metaphors that fail to coalesce into meaningful subtext; attempts at poetic resonance undermined by inconsistent application of literary devices. Ending offers thematic closure but lacks visceral impact or narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Permeated by formulaic phrasing and exaggerated descriptors; repetitive syntax patterns (e.g., "softly audible," "worn lottery ticket") suggest mechanical composition. Thematic treatment of "adaptation" is simplistic, failing to subvert expectations or explore psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Zombie elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; overemphasis on stylistic flourishes obscures narrative purpose. The story's brevity works against thematic development rather than enhancing it through concision.</comment>
