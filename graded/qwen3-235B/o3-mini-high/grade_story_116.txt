<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct personality traits or concrete motivations; exists primarily as a poetic device rather than a psychologically coherent entity. Actions (studying photos, sketching maps) don't reveal transformative character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; focuses on mood and introspection. No clear narrative arc within constraints. Cause-effect relationships are often abstract rather than concrete, compromising coherence within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich but generic night imagery creates atmospheric cohesion. Sensory details occasionally verge on cliche but effectively maintain melancholy tone. Setting works as mood amplifier but lacks specificity to ground abstract concepts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Striking poetic devices elevate the text. Some showing through recurring symbols (watch band, photos) but overall relies on abstract emotional statements. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks narrative payoff. Central theme of time/memory is present but thinly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrases ("celestial tapestry", "nocturnal dreams") risk purple prose. Some fresh metaphors offset by familiar melancholy tropes. Character logic follows poetic patterns rather than human psychology. Style feels deliberately literary but occasionally formulaic in its lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist thematically but lack synergistic integration. Poetic style enhances atmosphere at expense of narrative clarity. Length suits contemplative tone but limits actual storytelling. Lingering mood outweighs concrete thematic takeaways.</comment>
