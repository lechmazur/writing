<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's analytical unpredictability is stated but not fully dramatized; emotional shifts from forlorn to hopeful feel abrupt without sufficient behavioral grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot movement via moon-trail sprint lacks logical connection to thread object; coherence emerges only abstractly in the final thematic revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("joyful sorrow," "delicate harmony") borders on purple prose; character psychology feels algorithmically layered rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively as poetic scaffolding, but narrative remains more impressionistic tableau than fully realized story with concrete stakes or resolution.</comment>
