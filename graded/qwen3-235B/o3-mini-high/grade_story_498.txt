<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Alaric's nervousness and fragile ferocity are stated but underdeveloped; his actions (seed pods, detour, gardens) lack psychological depth connecting to motivation, often feeling abstract rather than driven by tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under word limit: rushed midwinter arc, vague cause-effect between detour and political shifts, abrupt transitions between themes; coherence strained by compressed pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cold imagery (midwinter frost, starless skies) evokes atmosphere, but xenophobic enclave's prejudice remains surface-level backdrop; gardens function symbolically but lack visceral sensory detail grounding readers in setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Symbology of seeds/gardens as rebellion is effective, but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstractions ("fragile flowering of change") and passive voice; central conflict against indifference lacks concrete, tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©s like "starless skies," "delicate patterns of frost"; character psychology leans on formulaic "reluctant leader" tropes; overuse of adjectives ("fragile ferocity") creates distance rather than immersion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically integrated; ornate prose obscures narrative clarity; brevity works against thematic complexity, leaving message unsubtle and underdeveloped.</comment>
