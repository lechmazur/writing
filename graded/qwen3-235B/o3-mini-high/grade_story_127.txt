<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions but lack depth; emotional resonance is superficial, and internal conflict feels conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but minimal; resolution feels abrupt, with insufficient tension or development to justify the emotional climax within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create atmosphere but occasionally verge on ornamental; setting enhances tone but doesn't fully integrate with narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Creative imagery and symbolism (e.g., gauntlet as legacy) partially elevate the narrative, but themes are stated overtly rather than earned through subtext or character depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overly stylized prose borders on florid, with clichéd phrases ("coded desperation") and predictable emotional arcs undercutting originality and narrative authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack transformative interplay; the story’s brevity serves atmosphere better than character or plot depth.</comment>
