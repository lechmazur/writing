<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict lacks concrete resolution; motivation (breaking curses) is abstract, not demonstrated through specific actions or decisions beyond lyrical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure follows a loose emotional arc (twilight to dawn) but lacks discrete narrative beats; poetic flow compensates for minimal cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned launch site evokes visceral decay through sensory details; contrasts hushed euphoria with ruinous machinery create haunting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., embroidery as rebellion, music as healing) create layered subtext; poetic language elevates theme of transformation but occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Originality in concepts (e.g., embroidering stanzas) contrasts with overwrought descriptors ("melancholic melodies weaving empathy") that border on purple prose; emotional depth exists but feels stylized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around transformation theme, though some feel superimposed (e.g., torpedo metaphor); lyrical style enhances impact but risks overshadowing narrative substance.</comment>
