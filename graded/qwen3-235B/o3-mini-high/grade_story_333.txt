<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character is primarily described through traits rather than actions; motivation to preserve architecture is stated, not demonstrated. Nuanced reasoning behind his sincerity as a "rebel" remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Meandering progression without clear structure; atmospheric moments lack causal momentum. No distinct arc or resolution emerges within constraints, creating an impression of stagnation rather than purposeful brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through sensory details and evocative metaphors ("whispers of history," "melting past/present") establishes a haunting, temporally layered environment that effectively permeates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphors elevate the prose, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract, overwrought phrasing. Subtext about confronting fear feels surface-level despite poetic framing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on Gothic tropes (haunted passages, cryptic notes) without subversion. Repetitive adjectives ("ethereal tremors," "spectral inscriptions") and overly ornate abstraction suggest formulaic tendencies. Nuanced emotional layers remain unexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; atmospheric strength contrasts with underdeveloped character logic and plot. Potential for thematic depth about tradition vs. change isnâ€™t fully realized.</comment>
