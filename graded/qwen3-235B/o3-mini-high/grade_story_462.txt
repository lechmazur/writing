<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character sketch remains overly abstract; motivations are implied through symbolism rather than evidenced by distinct actions or inner psychology. Vague, cliché "traveler" archetype lacks psychological depth or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure—merely a sequence of poetic images. Lacks causal progression; thematic framing (escape) remains unearned despite closing resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid decay motifs (shattered mirrors, weathered signs), cohesive coastal sensory details, and melancholic tone. Setting operates as emotional landscape but dominates over narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (sparks, mirrors) and lyrical prose create thematic cohesion. However, emotional impact diluted by lack of concrete conflict; resolution feels perfunctory rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prose veers between striking imagery and purple excess ("hammered repose," "defiant wonder"). Overreliance on abstract adjectives weakens authenticity; motifs feel derivative rather than transcendent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Formidable atmosphere but limited narrative momentum; elements cohere thematically yet lack functional integration. Depth implied but undercut by structural ambiguity.</comment>
