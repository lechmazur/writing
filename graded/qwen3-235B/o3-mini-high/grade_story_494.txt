<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (arrogance, doubt) are stated but not consistently demonstrated via actions or distinct voice. Internal struggle dominates, actions lack concrete purpose, and motivations remain vague rather than manifesting through specific choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Loose structural arc exists, but pacing drifts with excessive abstraction. The central action ("authorize") lacks narrative weight, cause-effect feels contrived, and the condensed format allows little room for organic progression. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere through visual details, but sensory immersion is uneven. The calligraphy master's courtyard creates thematic contrast, yet its connection to the swordsman's journey feels superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on metaphorical abstraction weakens emotional impact. Literary devices surface (tapestry symbolism, between-breaths motif), but overwrought prose dilutes subtext. Central themes of redemption lack visceral grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Laden with purple prose, clich√©d "warrior soul" tropes, and repetitive phrasing ("shackled potential," "harsh tenderness"). Emotional resonance relies on explicit telling over nuanced showing, with mechanical shifts between abstract concepts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; replacing several (e.g., calligraphy master setting, wedding song) would minimally affect cohesion. Style overshadows substance, leaving an impression of pretension rather than meaningful brevity.</comment>
