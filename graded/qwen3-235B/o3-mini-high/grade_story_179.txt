<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's traits and actions exist but lack concrete motivation; "confidence" clashes with indecisive symbolism, leaving hollow emotional architecture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative arc collapses under abstract diction; beginning/end share aesthetic but lack causal progression or pivotal stakes within the tight constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in hive setting elevates tone, but surreal imagery occasionally undermines functional worldbuilding coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</comment>Imagery resonates, but emotional impact diluted by overt thematic telling; conflict remains ambiguously psychological rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrasing dominates (e.g., "hypnotic gleam of honeyed cells"); similes/subtext feel algorithmically generated rather than intrinsically earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition eclipsed by structural looseness; elements like "coloring sessions" remain cryptic narrative dead ends without thematic payoff.</comment>
