<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paper-thin. Traits like "phobia-ridden" and "stunt double" exist as superficial descriptors rather than shaping Marcus' decisions. No clear progression from fear to courage occurs through concrete actions - it's stated rather than dramatized. The central object (envelope) reveals nothing specific about his character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Amorphous progression. The unraveling knot action lacks concrete cause-effect - how does each knot solve plot problems? The arc from "trembling" to "calm" feels artificial without meaningful obstacles. Pacing is directionless, with repetitive atmospheric descriptions substituting for momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echoing corridors and dusty textures create vague atmosphere. Sensory details occasionally pierce the fog ("whisper of wind"), but transitions to garage sales feel jarring. The pyramid setting works thematically but isn't leveraged for plot tension or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (knots=fears) are heavy-handed, not layered with subtext. No emotional investment in Marcus' journey - it's all abstract "hope" statements rather than earned catharsis. The ending lacks surprise: we've been told what's happening rather than shown a transformative moment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Purple prose on parade. Overused phrases like "whispers of ancient scholars" and inconsistent tone shifts (spiritual vs. numb) suggest formulaic writing. Stunt double profession isn't tied to any unique physicality or skill. Garages sales in a pyramid? Logic gaps betray artificial construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements function as disconnected checklist items rather than organic narrative components. The stunt double's phobia and envelope could apply to any plot. The brief length highlights structural weaknesses rather than feeling deliberate - nothing feels earned between pyramids and garage sales.</comment>
