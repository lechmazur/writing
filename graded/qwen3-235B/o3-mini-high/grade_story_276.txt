<question>1</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete traits/motivation consistency; "uneasy emissary" serves as vague abstraction with no tangible goals or behavioral logic. Reactions to the coathanger feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure lacks clear progression or causality; disjointed imagery sequences masquerade as plot. Opening and conclusion show no meaningful thematic tension/resolution within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere exists solely through overwrought sensory generalities ("sterile glow," "silent rhythms") failing to create immersive specificity. Setting disconnected from character actions or narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Relies on pretentious abstraction rather than emotional engagement; clich√©d literary devices ("symphony of gentle defiance") overshadow potential themes. Ending feels like arbitrary string of poetic phrases rather than meaningful denouement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overflows with generic metaphors and forced grandeur typical of algorithmic writing. "Branches of redemption" concept stated rather than dramatized; excessive adjectives drown out authentic character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Premise lacks narrative drive despite numerous elements; feels like artificial collage where components exist in isolation. No evidence of innovative combinations or thematic prioritization.</comment>
