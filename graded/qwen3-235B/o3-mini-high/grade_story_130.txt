<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations; symbolic representation overshadows meaningful psychological complexity. Assigned trait "privately open" inconsistently manifests.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Plot dissolves into static vignettes; no discernible arc or logical progression. Assigned action "reverse-engineer" remains abstract concept without mechanical or emotional development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting described with excessive adjectives but fails to create immersive physical space. Cosmic tree/orchard imagery disconnected from character's emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overwrought literary devices overwhelm narrative. Subtext buried under ironic detachment, preventing emotional engagement. No coherent theme emerges despite recurring metaphors.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>Pervasive purple prose. Repetitive cosmic irony, static-laden confessions, and "mocking affection" recur as formulaic placeholders. Emotional states stated rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elements superficially checked off list without meaningful integration. Length exacerbates structural incoherence rather than serving deliberate purpose. Terminates without narrative or thematic resolution.</comment>
