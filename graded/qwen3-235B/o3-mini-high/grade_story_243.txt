<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's jumpy trait lacks integration with decision-making; motivation to unmask icon is stated but underdeveloped; reactions to objects like the fishhook lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pseudo-epic structure has a discernible arc but feels rushed; cause-effect links between mural analysis, glitches, and icon confrontation are implied rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hyper-saturated digital atmosphere is evocative but sensory overload obscures ecological coherence; pixelated moon and neon are vivid but disconnected from character exigencies.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric system (e.g., glowing fishhook as resistance) but emotional beats rely on grandiose phrasing; ending achieves thematic resonance but feels engineered rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Attempts originality through juxtaposing mysticism with digital decay, but tropes like "corrupted code" and "whispered myths" undermine innovation; lush descriptions occasionally cross into purple prose territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Excessive worldbuilding fragments coexist with underdeveloped character logic; contrivances to integrate assigned elements sacrifice emotional authenticity and narrative precision.</comment>
