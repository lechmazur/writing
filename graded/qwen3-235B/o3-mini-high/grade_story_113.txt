<question>1</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Character's traits (hesitant/shyly loud) inconsistently demonstrated through abstract descriptors rather than concrete actions; motivation to "unravel sorrow" lacks tangible emotional grounding despite symbolic objects.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes lyrical abstraction over plot progression; dream-hopping method poorly defined and disconnected from any meaningful narrative arc within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Xenon-lit tunnel provides vivid visuals but atmosphere remains static and overly stylized; fails to actively shape character actions or thematic exploration of time's fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Self-consciously poetic language draws attention to itself rather than deepening emotional impact; themes of time and renewal remain abstract rather than emerging organically from narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Reliance on repetitive metaphor patterns ("fragile threads," "ironic awe") and overadorned prose suggests formulaic construction; emotional resonance largely stated rather than shown through character specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>High-concept elements remain decorative rather than integrated into cohesive thematic exploration; the ending feels artificially imposed rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>
