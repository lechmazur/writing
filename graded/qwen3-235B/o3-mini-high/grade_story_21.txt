<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations for decoding genetics are stated but not demonstrated. Jests feel performative rather than revealing, and "abrasive calm" lacks specific behavioral manifestations. The fox tail is symbolic but doesn't earn its thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot drifts through atmospheric vignettes without clear cause-effect. The "decoding genetic patterns" objective isn't operationalized narratively. Ending feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned through plotted tension. Timeframe and action connections are tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong sensory immersion in decay (must, velvet, crumbling texts) creates a haunting atmosphere. However, "organically synthetic" and "drum circles" feel superficially appended rather than essential to the setting's emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Excessive adjectives ("irrevocable sacrifice," "relentless economy of revenge") suggest overwritten pomposity. Tropes like "scent of must" and "spectral recollections" read as AI-generated placeholders. Emotional stakes remain abstract, told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Misuse of "fox tail tassel" and "genetic patterns" as empty metaphors undermines cohesion. The forced juxtaposition of "organically synthetic" lacks philosophical rigor. Brief length exposes structural fragility rather than serving as an artistic choice.</comment>
