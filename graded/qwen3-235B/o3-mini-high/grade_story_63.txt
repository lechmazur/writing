<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract concept rather than living entity. Traits of "reserved" and "humbly proud" are stated rather than demonstrated through meaningful actions. Motivation to preserve art lacks emotional depth or personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Narrative exists as static vignette without clear cause-effect progression. Mending action serves as repetitive motif rather than genuine plot driver. The tremor-to-repair arc feels perfunctory rather than earned, with no discernible transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich auditory descriptions create immersive atmosphere, particularly choir/laboratory interplay. Sensory details about texture of cuffs and peeled wallpaper provide visual tangibility. However, setting elements remain isolated rather than forming cohesive ecosystem.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose exhibits lyrical quality through recurring metaphors and rhythmic cadence. Central theme of preservation vs. transformation emerges through repeated imagery, though emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. Ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic vagueness and abstract conceits. Formulaic transitions between choir echoes and laboratory activities. Character psychology remains schematic. Metaphors feel self-consciously "literary" without grounding in concrete experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist without achieving organic synthesis. Technical requirements met with minimal narrative justification. Prose style prioritizes ornamental language over functional clarity. Premise suggests depth but execution remains aesthetically surface-bound.</comment>
