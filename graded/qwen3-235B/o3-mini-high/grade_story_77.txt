<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lacks internal conflict beyond stated traits; empathy/vulnerability underexplored; motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Actions driven more by poetic concept than organic character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented structure mimics the marionette thematically but sacrifices narrative momentum; circular ending avoids resolution; cause-effect between relics and actions feels loosely connected through mystical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but inconsistent atmosphere: space pirate grit clashes with ethereal mountain allegory; sensory details (cosmic light, rusted corridors) immersive but unevenly balanced between sci-fi decay and metaphysical symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (broken marionette = fractured society) are blunt rather than evocative; emotional resonance diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction vs. specific human-scale stakes; theme of restoration lacks nuanced execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Purple prose dominates ("whispers of interstellar wanderings") with overwrought adjectives; repetitive "drowsy enthusiasm" clich√©d; abstract "mountain wisdom" reads like algorithmic trope-blending; emotional cues dictated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements crammed together through thematic proximity alone; the "why" remains vague; style's ornate detachment undermines emotional urgency; ambitious concept overwhelms constrained form, leaving impression of fragmented vignettes rather than unified story.</comment>
