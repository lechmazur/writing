<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits are descriptive rather than demonstrated through actions or decisions. Motivation (impossible vow) lacks psychological depth or organic connection to assigned attributes. Reactions to objects feel arbitrary rather than revealing character essence. No distinct narrative voice to anchor perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear assembly sequence but lacks narrative stakes or tension. Cause-effect chain feels engineered rather than emergent. Pacing prioritizes atmospheric description over meaningful progression toward resolution. Storytelling momentum stalls under excessive ornamental language.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create immersive sci-fi aesthetic. Time-worn artifacts contrasting with techno-future establishes effective visual motif. Atmosphere prioritized over substance; setting doesn't organically shape character motivations or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on poetic metaphor but lacks emotional immediacy. Central theme of rebirth through recombination hinted but remains abstract. Storytelling momentum undercut by repetitive phrasing and uneven pacing. Suggestive imagery without concrete narrative consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival density ("arcane repair," "tactile whispers") borders on purple prose. Tropes (secret rebel weavers, detached warrior) employed without subversion. Predictable emotional beats ("spark of rebirth") lack authentic resonance. Stylistic flourishes outweigh narrative function.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved primarily through surface-level thematic juxtaposition rather than organic narrative integration. Elements present but underexploited. Style dominates substance with insufficient emotional or intellectual payoff. Length neither enhances nor detracts from narrative.</comment>
