<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pilot traits remain abstract and unconnected to meaningful action; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through behavior; character voice dissolves beneath overwritten thematic declarations; lacks tangible emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Chronology and causality collapse under static poetic abstraction; no discernible progression from beginning to end; thematic statements substitute for plot mechanics; pacing vacillates between stagnant rumination and sudden, unearned resolutions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport's aesthetic potential partially realized through industrial decay imagery; sensory details present but often disconnected from narrative purpose; atmospheric melancholy intermittently effective but inconsistently tied to character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on abstract symbolic gestures rather than earned emotional engagement; lyrical prose cannot compensate for hollow thematic scaffolding; central conflict remains intangible; excessive metaphorical layering obscures rather than enhances thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repetitive adjective clusters and mannered phrasing suggest algorithmic embellishment patterns; metaphors (coffee stains as future texts, "fractal sorrow") lack concrete grounding; emotional resonance consistently stated rather than demonstrated through lived consequences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist without meaningful integration; prose prioritizes stylistic posturing over narrative lucidity; length exposes underdeveloped premises rather than showcasing condensed brilliance; thematic ambitions remain unearned abstraction rather than resonant innovation.</comment>
