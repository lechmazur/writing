<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character traits are frequently stated but rarely demonstrated. Motivation to find beauty feels abstract rather than driving concrete actions. The "shyly unstoppable" attribute lacks sufficient narrative manifestation through choices or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal momentum - warped realities emerge without clear narrative logic. Film club interludes create disjointed pacing. Minimal story progression; tension between decay and beauty remains thematic rather than dramatized through action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmospheric mastery through sensory details (murky mists, creaking timbers) and symbolic decay. Timeframe inconsistencies between midnight vigil and film clubs disrupt spatial-temporal cohesion despite strong setting establishment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and recurring metaphors create lingering impressions but lack emotional urgency. Ending feels abrupt rather than cathartic. Literary devices overwhelm character engagement; central conflict remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Repetitive descriptors ("fierce repose") and abstract phrasing border on purple prose. Surrealist elements feel derivative rather than freshly imagined. Motivation is declarative with insufficient psychological nuance or character-specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Element integration is inconsistent. Atmospheric cohesion exists without sufficient narrative purpose. Brief length highlights structural fragmentation rather than precision. Leaves atmospheric impression over substantive resonance.</comment>
