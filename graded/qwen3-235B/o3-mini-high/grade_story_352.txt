<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and passive; motivations stated but not demonstrated through actions. Lacks distinct voice or tangible decisions. Assigned attribute "blithe discontent" poorly integrated into behavior or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>No coherent plot structure; meandering imagery fails to establish cause-effect relationships. Beginning and end disconnected, pacing stagnant. Assigned elements float without narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details create evocative visuals, but sensory immersion feels superficial. Setting's surreal qualities don't deepen thematic connections or character motivations.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphors lack emotional payoff; no central conflict or resolution. Writing style prioritizes ornamentation over narrative momentum. Theme of preservation emerges faintly but lacks narrative embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Relies on dense, repetitive phraseology ("whispered secrets," "fragile notes") and overwrought descriptions that read as decorative rather than revelatory. Character psychology feels diagrammatic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than interrelation; forced juxtapositions without deeper synthesis. Style obscures narrative clarity, brevity feels restrictive rather than intentional.</comment>
