<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s chameleonic ability justifies his investigative method but emotional depth feels imposed rather than organically explored; motivations pivot too easily between career purpose and melodramatic revelation. The “rationally impulsive” trait lacks sufficient psychological nuance in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot mechanics align (skin-shifting enables cold-case-solving), but the revelation about the oil’s transformation feels telegraphed rather than earned; pacing falters in the final paragraph where the thematic pivot from grief to compassion requires lingering, not summary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts (holographic dragons vs. crumbling pillars) create intrigue, but the setting’s potential to interrogate humanity’s relationship with environmental collapse remains underdeveloped; sensory details dazzle but often detach from narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of dissolving dresses mirrors ecological transience effectively, but the ending’s moralizing about “emotional honesty” undercuts the subtler tragedy of resource wars; the “anxious serenity” tone is inconsistently rendered through passive description rather than visceral character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fusion of method-acting and forensic speculation is ingeniously speculative, yet moments like the “Great Water Wars” reference feel like recycled dystopian shorthand; emotional beats rely too heavily on stated grief rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story’s ambition to marry personal trauma to global resource collapse is laudable, but uneven execution—particularly the abrupt thematic pivot in the final paragraph—weakens its impact; the brevity works against complexity rather than enhancing it.</comment>
