<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters' motivations tied to tradition vs. innovation are clear, but their histories and personalities lack depth beyond the conflict; the fatal flaw ties into the theme but isn't fully explored beyond surface parallels to the grandmother's past.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The duel-turned-reconciliation drives the plot effectively, with cause-and-effect coherence. Pacing is efficient but occasionally rushed (e.g., sudden shift from antagonism to cooperation), undermining emotional gravity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (e.g., "hum of server rooms," "alien spores"), but the abandoned spaceport setting could integrate more fully with character dynamics or themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (recipes as living legacy) and symbolism (spores as change). The theme of growth through compromise is clear, with emotional resonance in Marcus's transformation and the poignant ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with mutated recipes and sci-fi backdrop, but relies on predictable emotional beats (e.g., last-minute reconciliation). Some phrases ("bitter rivalry") lean generic despite otherwise precise imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven, but the brevity leaves some ideas underdeveloped (e.g., the brothers' history). The story’s message is delivered effectively, though its emotional complexity could deepen further.</comment>
