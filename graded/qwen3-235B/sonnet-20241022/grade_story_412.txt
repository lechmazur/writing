<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's dual identity is conceptually strong but lacks nuanced emotional texture; inner conflict feels implied rather than viscerally experienced through specific actions or choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates thematic cohesion despite tight word limit, though revelation about frequencies feels slightly rushed; cyclical nightmare motif ties opening and closing effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere has visceral sensory details (humming station, burning books) and appropriate mournful tone, but deeper integration between geolocation element and setting could enhance spatial awareness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surveillance culture and ancient mysticism avoids most formulaic elements; occasional generic descriptors ("racing thoughts") undercut otherwise inventive conceptual fusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements work collectively toward a cohesive whole with occasional friction; length enhances thematic compression but limits deeper exploration of key ideas like "frequency knowledge" mechanics.</comment>
