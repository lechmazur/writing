<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Penelope’s transformation from “submissive” hostess to perceptive spy is plausible but lacks psychological depth; her decisive shift feels abrupt despite clever setup with the cats. Dialogue maintains voice but underexplores her internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The central conflict (stopping the test) is resolved efficiently but leans on overly convenient details (her prior intel on Whitmore Street). Pacing is brisk, but the ending’s sudden professional shift for Penelope feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The contrast between genteel gardening and spy lair works conceptually, but the atmosphere is underexploited: sensory details (e.g., metallic stench of the compound, tactile descriptions of espionage tech) are sparse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The satirical tone—marrying British decorum to spy thriller tropes—is sharp and memorable. The cats symbolize vulnerability vs. power, and the “hiding in plain sight” theme resonates, though emotional stakes feel slightly surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story cleverly subverts expectations (prim hostess as spy) but occasionally relies on genre clichés (hollow garden tools). The “feral cats” add warmth without veering into sentimentality, though the prose occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing (“liquify steel”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Premise-driven structure sacrifices some nuance but balances whimsy and tension effectively. Assignments are woven tightly enough to avoid feeling contrived, though the spy-training-facility’s specifics are underexplored.</comment>
