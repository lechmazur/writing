<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (exposing corruption), but internal conflict remains underdeveloped despite telepathic perspective; hair tie symbolizes connection but lacks emotional payoff beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows logical arc from discovery to action to resolution, but pacing stumbles in depicting telepathic collaboration spreading; festival climax feels abrupt despite groundwork laid.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The steam-soaked industrial grime permeates every line, creating immersive atmosphere where soot and deception intertwine; sensory details like "dark ink on parchment" thought-streams enhance the setting's tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink/water diffusion for telepathic communication) and layered symbols (disintegrating hair tie as truth's fragility) create profound thematic resonance; ending's melancholy triumph perfectly crystallizes the story's emotional core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy tropes through unique telepathic stone network concept; occasional purple prose in describing calligraphy-like mental merging strains credulity; emotional nuance balances against occasional abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Masterful cohesion despite multiple assigned elements; each component serves dual purposes (e.g., hair tie as both symbol and narrative catalyst); brief length feels artistically deliberate in maintaining focused historical scope.</comment>
