<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Symbolically motivated but lacks visceral emotional depth; character's internal conflict is suggested rather than fully dramatized through concrete actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints but feels more like a poetic vignette than a tightly plotted narrative; progression from observation to participation is logically sound yet hurried.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stunningly realized surreal environment where every element creates thematic harmony; inverted physics and celestial metaphors amplify emotional subtext through meticulously constructed atmospheric tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic throughlines (combs, tarnish, celestial mechanics) create multi-layered meaning; ending achieves profound thematic resonance through precise metaphorical action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through surreal originality but occasionally falters with slightly mannered phrasing; emotional progression feels authentically human despite the fantastical framework.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exceptionally cohesive synthesis of elements produces enduring thematic impression; brevity enhances rather than limits narrative potency through poetic compression of ideas.</comment>
