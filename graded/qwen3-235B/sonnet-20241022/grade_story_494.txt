<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Transition from arrogance to humility is clear but lacks nuanced inner conflict; his song-as-magic method aligns with motivation but underdevelops emotional stakes beyond surface regret.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resolving wards through song provides clear arc; beginning/end connections strong, but compressed pacing occasionally strains credibility of his transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes decay and renewal through vivid sensory details (fluttering fabric, light-as-ink), but setting's integration with character psychology feels partially superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors like "threads of authorization" enhance theme; emotional resonance diluted by occasionally passive descriptions of transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique calligraphy/song fusion, but some phrasing (e.g., "shackles of his own making") leans formulaic; emotional subtext lacks full realization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements synergize tightly toward redemption arc, though timeframe ("between breaths") serves more as poetic device than structural anchor.</comment>
