<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Characters are conceptually solid but emotionally flat; motivations exist but lack deeper exploration of internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; key transitions (e.g., machines turning autonomously) lack logical buildup, undermining momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details, but atmospheric tension unevenly balances industrial grit with cosmic magic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and theme integration (science/magic synthesis), but emotional resonance diluted by underdeveloped character psychology.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in concept (conjurer/physicist dyad) but falters with occasionally ornate descriptions and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but stretch plausibility; the tight format sacrifices nuanced character and plot development for abstraction.</comment>
