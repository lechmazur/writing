<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hints at internal conflict but lacks depth in exploring Maya's motivation beyond surface shame; her transformation feels abrupt without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on a single conversation; pacing is deliberate but risks feeling static; the Colonial President's speech adds artificial urgency without integrating fully into the narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting blends retro-futurism effectively but relies on familiar tropes (e.g., "technological ruins"); sensory details are evocative but unevenly distributed, favoring visual elements over others.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Arc of human connection across time resonates emotionally; dialogue and metaphor ("gravity of Earth vs. profession") are poignant but occasionally slip into sentimental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of historical and futuristic elements avoids clich√©, but phrases like "ancient continuum" and "validate journeys" flirt with overused romanticism; emotional beats lean on subtext but occasionally default to telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All elements serve the narrative, but thematic cohesion sometimes overshadows organic development; the brevity sharpens focus but leaves some concepts (e.g., unspoken rules) under-explored.</comment>
