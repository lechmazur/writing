<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character voices and motivations are clear but lack depth; Marcus's arc shows growth but remains underexplored due to brevity. The woman's drive to free him feels abrupt without sufficient backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight 500-word structure holds; the action's progression from encounter to resolution feels logical and complete despite limitations. Pacing occasionally rushes emotional beats but maintains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (salt-crusted windows, dancing shadows) masterfully build eerie nostalgia. Setting and concept are meaningfully interconnected through the circular lighthouse motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical depth elevates the theme of impermanence. Ending delivers emotional resonance through understatement. Some dialogue borders on exposition-heavy but doesn't fully undermine impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echoes of tropes (ghostly scholars, arrogant immortality seekers) are cleverly subverted but occasionally undermined by slightly overwrought phrasing ("whisper-thin veil between worlds"). Unique voice distinguishable from formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohesively propel plot and theme. Brief length feels purposeful, leaving room for contemplation. Occasional moments strain towards poetic brevity rather than fully earned profundity.</comment>
