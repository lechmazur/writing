<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Restless trait is stated but not deeply integrated into decision-making; motivation for preserving legacy is clear but voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc connects beginning to end logically, but pacing falters slightly in middle; cause-effect relationships hold despite tight word limit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are functional rather than revelatory; cohesion exists but lacks the cohesion depth to justify each element's necessity.</comment>
