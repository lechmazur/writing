<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s connection to her father’s cap and necromantic role is clear, but her internal conflict and emotional complexity remain underexplored. The shared love for movies as a control mechanism is inventive but feels more plot-driven than psychologically authentic. Motivation for mapping is implied but lacks visceral urgency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from mapping incantations to discovery, but the narrow word limit leaves some transitions (e.g., spirits responding to films) feeling underdeveloped. The central action is coherent but lacks escalating tension or a substantive resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details—bioluminescent crystals, frozen gases, holographic films—create a hauntingly specific atmosphere. The blending of old cinematic nostalgia with alien environment is evocative, though the "movie palace" coincidence strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of juxtaposition (ancient necromancy vs. quantum tech) and subtext about legacy vs. innovation. Emotional impact is muted by overly explanatory prose in parts; some imagery (e.g., dancing spirits) lacks depth beyond visual flourish.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging necromancy with sci-fi exploration. Avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on genre tropes (haunted artifacts, holographic ghosts). Character reactions to films feel humanized, not algorithmic, with fresh metaphors outweighing a few clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements are cohesively interwoven, with the story feeling purposefully concise rather than constrained. The fusion of themes—discovery, legacy, technology’s limits—lingers, though the ending prioritizes atmosphere over narrative payoff.</comment>
