<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivations rooted in personal loss are poignant, but deeper emotional exploration of Marcus' isolation or existential doubts would strengthen his dimensionality beyond the archetypal "curator" role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc is coherent but constrained; transitions between puzzle creation and spiritual resolution feel fluid yet perfunctory, lacking escalating stakes or moments of doubt to heighten tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Victorian library setting excels in sensory immersion via frost-painted pages and whispers, though the "starless night" motif lacks deeper symbolic connection to the thematic interplay of light/dark and connection/disconnection.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., crosswords as "bridges," reconciliation as "seeds") layer poetic depth; ending resonates with cyclical closure, though subtext on art as redemptive labor could be more pronounced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally veers into gothic melodrama ("fertile soil of the afterlife"). Sensory details feel vivid yet occasionally over-curated, hinting at calculated atmospherics over raw originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly—rewritten diaries and keys deserve more narrative weight. Prose elegance elevates the concept, yet the tight word limit leaves structural ambition partially unfulfilled.</comment>
