<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters serve plot more than reveal depth; dual perspectives leave little space for emotional nuance beyond surface prophecy stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Largely coherent but rushed climax; transitions from market to mountain lack grounding in character psychology.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Visceral details (phosphorescent moss, crystal shadows) create atmosphere but emotional gravitas is uneven across scenes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar tropes (twins, prophecies) without radical reinvention; baseball as proof of future feels inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels engineered by constraints; tighter integration of elements could elevate the narrative beyond competent execution.</comment>
