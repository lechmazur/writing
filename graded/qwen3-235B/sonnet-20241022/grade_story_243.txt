<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jumpy traits are consistent and contextualized through glitching robes and trembling steps, but motivation beyond surface-level iconoclasm lacks emotional nuance; "voice" remains generic despite determined dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concisely constructed three-act progression from pursuit to revelation to confrontation; paint-drip analysis drives plot despite compressed pacing; resolution feels earned though slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fully immersive 8-bit gaming atmosphere with vivid visual/sound design contrasts between retro charm and corrupted malevolence; underutilizes non-visual senses but strengthens setting-character congruity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich writing (viral ruler, resurrected code as justice) creates thematic weight; ending achieves symbolic closure; tension between nostalgia and truth sustains engagement without melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through pixel-specific subversions (e.g., protest mural decryption) but contains occasional purple prose ("fallen pixel-warrior"); balances AI-style worldbuilding with human-scale emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements organically interwoven (glowing hook as narrative linchpin, hidden protest mural as revelation mechanism); compressed format amplifies urgency without sacrificing thematic cohesion.</comment>
