<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>A clearly defined motivation drives Lyra, but her internal conflict and emotional depth remain underdeveloped. The ability to hear falling leaves is well-integrated with her actions, but her "feral" aspect feels inconsistently portrayed beyond basic nomadic traits. The "casual frustration" hint at voice, but first-person narration might have strengthened character presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure emerges despite constraints: entry via leaf sound establishes stakes, factory manipulation shows progression, and the starless dawn provides emotional resolution. Pacing maintains momentum through precise, evocative action beats. Some cause-and-effect connections rely on vague technical details ("condensed starlight") but never break narrative logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Melancholic atmosphere of fading stars enhances thematic resonance. The invisible ink factory's paradoxical transparency and emptiness creates rich visual and conceptual tension. Sensory details like crystalline surfaces catching light and whispering leaves immerse readers without overloading prose. The sky-cities' dying music gains tragic weight through environmental decay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate deeply: ephemeral ink becomes eternalized music, vanishing stars mirror cultural oblivion. The final image of walls singing with luminescent notation offers striking symbolic payoff. Emotional impact emerges through precise, understated gestures rather than explicit sentiment, though some poetic descriptions border on overwrought ("moment between dreaming and waking").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise avoids clich√© despite cosmic melancholia tropes. The dying stars setting and disappearing ink concept feel fresh through specific execution. Avoids purple prose through concrete imagery ("weather-beaten cloak," "crystallized sound of thunder"). Some phrasing ("delightfully absurd") momentarily disrupts tone with forced whimsy. Overall demonstrates clear authorial vision rather than algorithmic defaults.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Multifaceted elements coalesce into conceptually rich narrative. The factory doesn't feel like a narrative container but a living paradox of memory/oblivion. Brief length serves the mythic quality rather than constraining development. Ending lingers with thematic and emotional residue, inviting contemplation of cultural preservation in the face of cosmic entropy.</comment>
