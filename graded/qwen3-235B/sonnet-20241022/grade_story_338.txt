<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thorne's eccentric genius and detachment are well-defined but her transformation into finding wonder feels slightly underdeveloped within the word limit. The cracked case's influence on her character lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear beginning/end with temporal discovery and ascent, but pacing stumbles with abrupt conceptual leaps (e.g., colleagues' dismissal vs. underground success). Causal logic between call patterns and conclusions remains vague.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subway decay juxtaposed with spiraling time creates strong atmosphere. Sensory details (backward watches, rotary static) work, but underutilizes olfactory/tactile elements in tunnel descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ambiguous tension between science/magic resonates emotionally. Effective use of "temporal fossils" and call log poetry, but the ending's "extraordinary/ordinary" message feels slightly trite despite layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original time-bending premise diluted by familiar "isolated genius vindicated" trope. Writing style avoids purple prose but slips into AI-like abstraction ("overlapping voices tell their own story") during thematic heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a contemplative whole yet lack revelatory impact. The tight structure serves the concept but sacrifices deeper exploration of temporal paradoxes or character contradictions.</comment>
