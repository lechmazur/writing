<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus' stoicism and loneliness are clear but underexplored; his core motivation (returning wallet) catalyzes emotional transformation that feels rushed but poignant, particularly in his handwriting recognition moment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from wallet-returning to sanctuary visit, with emotional arc completed by sunrise. Tight word limit creates tension; some shifts (e.g., from bar to sanctuary) feel compressed but deliberate. Paper plane bookending works effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory integration (humming boxes, honeyed light, creaking sign) creates memorable sanctuary atmosphere. Bees as motif for authenticity enhances theme. Rusty Anchor establishes urban decay contrast with natural sanctuary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Paper plane symbolism ties emotional isolation to connection; dialogue achieves nuanced vulnerability (e.g., "pompous wisdom" line). Ending avoids saccharine resolution through restrained "untamed sincerity" declaration. Underlying theme of performed detachment vs authentic connection resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors (bees as authenticity symbols, paper planes as emotional conduits), but occasional purple prose ("amber hues"). Emotional shifts shown through concrete details rather than explicit statements. Avoids full AI-voice issues but has isolated overwrought phrases.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Poorly labeled as "pirate radio" gimmick; instead, elements create layered meditation on human connection. Sanctuary worldbuilding anchors fantastical paper plane mechanics. Lingering question about how radio persona evolves post-encounter gives thematic resonance beyond brief runtime.</comment>
