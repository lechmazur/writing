<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters function as narrative tools more than fully realized beings; Marcus's duty is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond surface-level stoicism, while secondary characters exist primarily to service theme rather than individual arcs.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wedding-to-extinction arc demonstrates tight pacing and thematic cohesion; moments of tension (e.g., kill switch contemplation) could be better integrated into the celebratory atmosphere for stronger dramatic irony.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lab-as-chapel setting merges science with ritual brilliantly; underutilized potential in sensory contrast between sterile equipment and organic celebration, leaving atmosphere tantalizingly incomplete.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subtext about creation/destruction duality resonates powerfully; uneven balance between poetic metaphors (green things burdened by consciousness) and blunt thematic statements weakens subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mixes genre tropes (ancient guardians, mad scientists) with fresh combinations (weddings in laboratories); occasional over-reliance on conceptual contrasts over organic character behavior slightly undercuts uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; the paradoxical intersection of joy and cosmic horror lingers, though tighter synthesis between personal and philosophical stakes would elevate the work.</comment>
