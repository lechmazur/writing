<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's dual expertise lacks nuance; motivations inferred through plot rather than internal conflict, emotional reactions occasionally mechanistic despite poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coincidences strain credibility (crossword/resonance pattern overlap); pacing uneven with abrupt transitions between thematic revelations, though closure in lighthouse beam ties to motif.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (splintered panels, thrumming timbers, fog) establish immersive mood; quantum-folklore interplay occasionally undermines setting's mythic authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Poetic synthesis of science/spirituality through metaphor; ending's thematic resonance weakened by overreliance on epiphany tropes instead of earned emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Quantum-folklore thesis shows ingenuity but employs familiar "isolated genius" and "haunted artifact" tropes; language balances economy and lyricism without excessive ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>High concept executed unevenly; thematic ambition outpaces character complexity and emotional grounding, but conceptual fusion lingers as intellectual provocation.</comment>
