<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emissary’s unease and motivation evolve coherently but lack deeper psychological nuance. Her interactions with the engineer drive development but feel slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows smoothly with thematic bookends, but the tight word limit compresses pivotal moments, slightly diluting emotional weight despite a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting is conceptually vivid but relies on abstract descriptions; sensory details are minimal, leaving the atmosphere more implied than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (coathanger/orbit parallels, picnic-ecosystem parallels) and thematic resonance elevate the story, though dialogue occasionally veers into schematic “wisdom.”</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive alien perspective and organic symbolism, though the engineer’s instant insight into the emissary’s identity feels slightly contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated, with the story’s brevity enhancing its poignant tone. Some thematic depth is sacrificed for conciseness.</comment>
