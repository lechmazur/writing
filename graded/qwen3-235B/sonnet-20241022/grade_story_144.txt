<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weakness lies in underexplored internal conflict despite clear external motivation; Marina's actions support her role as peacekeeper but lack psychological depth</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Well-structured for brevity with circular beginning/end, but pacing feels compressed; cause-effect relationships maintain coherence despite tight word limit</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptionally strong sensory atmosphere - spectral mist, creaking timbers, melting starlight create immersive haunted kitchen that directly supports theme and character actions</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through symbolism (imperfect harmony = peace); effective ending reinforces theme; occasional "showing" overshadows subtlety but overall strong craft</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally slips into "flowery phrases" (e.g. "calm frenzy") and predictable cosmic metaphors; maintains consistent tone with fresh enough perspective</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work in concert rather than feeling imposed; brevity feels deliberate; combines assigned elements with creative synergy; lingers through thematic resonance</comment>
