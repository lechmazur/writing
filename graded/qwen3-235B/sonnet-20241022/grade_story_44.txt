<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to preserve equine traditions shapes her actions, but the 'feisty' trait remains superficially sketched. Her intellectual playfulness enriches her character but isn’t deeply woven into her decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story’s arc is clear—art creation as redemption—but pacing in the middle (holographic data decoding) lacks tension. Cause-effect is logical, though some transitions between memories and present actions feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Radiant, cohesive atmosphere: The orbital stables, debris studio, and carnival relics merge sensory wonder with melancholy. The lamp’s interaction with sculptures creates vivid, symbolic imagery enhancing mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through understated symbolism (e.g., tears as spheres in zero-g). Subtext about memory amid progress is strong, though some 'telling' (e.g., “bold certainty”) dilutes immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with fresh juxtapositions (carnival holography in space), but phrases like “discarded memories” verge on sentimentality. Emotional beats rely partially on stated feelings rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>All elements feel purposefully integrated, though car commutes as reflective moments lack unique stylistic distinction. The ending’s thematic payoff lingers, but the brevity occasionally strains narrative depth.</comment>
