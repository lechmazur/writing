<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s obsession with forbidden knowledge is consistent but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but overly archetypal (mad scholar trope).</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but strained pacing: rapid shifts between exposition and climax dilute tension. The convergence of ley lines feels abruptly prioritized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized (eerie library’s impossible geometry, dust-covered whispers), though the warlock’s “designer hoodie” jars tonally with the ancient atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegantly evokes themes of obsession and forbidden knowledge; haunting ending. Overreliance on phrases like “forbidden theorems” weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Combines myth and tech refreshingly but veers toward purple prose (“impossible truths,” “calendar fluttered in a nonexistent wind”). Emotional resonance is undercut by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story is cohesive and thought-provoking but occasionally strained by its ambition; the concept-plot integration is creative yet occasionally forced within the word limit.</comment>
