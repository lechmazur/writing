<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Maya's rebellion feels superficially etched - her quiet determination is more grief-shaped than defiant. The pocket knife's symbolic resonance enriches her connection to the mother's legacy, though her motivations remain more emotionally intuitive than meticulously constructed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses linearly with clear cause-effect between call and climax, but the rapid transition from haunted house solitude to restaurant resurrection strains credibility. The thematic thread of adaptation provides cohesion despite compressed beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (sunset through cobwebs, pho's transformative scents) create a hauntingly hopeful atmosphere. The mechanical ghosts vs. culinary warmth contrast establishes effective tonal duality, though some descriptions verge on picturesque clich√©.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (ghosts as memories, kitchen as sanctuary) and symbolic pocket knife enrich subtext. The ending delivers emotional payoff through showing, not telling, with the developer's conversion through taste being particularly poignant yet understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The rebellion trope and family legacy premise border on familiar, but the haunted house/chef hybrid setting offers originality. Avoids purple prose, though some phrasing ("haunting spirits taught how to live") slightly veers into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Most assigned elements organically serve the narrative - particularly the pocket knife's multiple blades as metaphor. The rebellion aspect and ephemeral gloom tone feel less essential compared to the haunting culinary core.</comment>
