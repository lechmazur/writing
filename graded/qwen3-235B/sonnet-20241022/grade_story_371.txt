<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation aligns with actions, but lacks depth in showing internal conflict; traits like "fashionably unfashionable" are superficially rendered rather than woven into psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing feels compressed; key plot points (security codes, upload, mission) lack emotional weight; the marbles' decoding drives action but climax feels abrupt and underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in the cyberpunk night market immerse readers, but the "storm" timeframe’s thematic role remains underexploited, disconnected from Marcus’s mission.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (hatpin as rebellion, marbles as codes) add subtext; theme of nobility through resistance is clear but moral ambiguity treated superficially; ending lacks resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some elements (quantum marbles, holographic rain) lean on genre tropes; prose occasionally veers into stylized excesses ("fervent apathy") without fresh metaphorical twists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story functions cohesively but relies heavily on assigned elements as plot devices rather than organic narrative components; tone and theme lack bold differentiation from similar cyberpunk tales.</comment>
