<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya’s transformation lacks visceral emotional depth; her shift from accountant to guide feels underexplored beyond narrative assertion. The “softly militant” grandmother’s influence is hinted but not fully woven into her core motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot adheres to an arc (discovery → decoding → revelation), but the compressed timeline flattens cause-effect; pivotal moments (e.g., deciphering notes) feel rushed, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The purple sky and rooftop farm evoke a tactile post-apocalyptic atmosphere, but sensory details (touch of soil, taste of air) remain sparse, limiting full immersion in the reconstructed world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., gravitational threads) stand out, but the theme of loss-as-transformation only skim-the-surface of subtext; the ending satisfies thematically but lacks emotional gut-punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The spyglass-gravity premise is original, but “softly militant” and “coerce” lean into vague phrasing; some phrases (e.g., “delicate threads of gravitational force”) verge on generic poeticism rather than sharp specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ideas linger, but uneven integration of elements (e.g., attic scavenging’s marginal role) and occasional melodrama dilute cohesion; the ending’s thematic closure is undercut by undercooked setup.</comment>
