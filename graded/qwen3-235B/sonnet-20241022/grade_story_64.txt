<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While Mira's arc of relinquishing the dragon scale reveals her evolved understanding of immortality, her "uncertain" nature feels underexplored. Her motivations are clear but lack visceral internal conflict to ground her transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Efficient use of the short form, with a coherent arc from trial to revelation, but pacing falters in connecting backstory fragments. The dragon scale's symbolic role drives the plot, yet key emotional beats feel shorthand rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery of floating marketplaces and creaking balloons creates atmosphere, but worldbuilding remains static. The setting's whimsy contrasts with the philosophical core without deep integration into the protagonist's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ending resonates with paradoxical wisdom about impermanence as true immortality, elevated by metaphors like "footprints in the dust." Overreliance on abstractions ("ordinary miracles") occasionally weakens emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s in its anti-chase for immortality, favoring quiet introspection. Some phrases ("wild places where immortality bloomed like weeds") verge on overwritten, but the central twist on mortality as inherent to magic feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically around interconnectedness, but the floating marketplace and scuff-map mechanics feel conceptually distinct rather than organically linked. Lingering resonance comes from philosophy, not narrative.</comment>
