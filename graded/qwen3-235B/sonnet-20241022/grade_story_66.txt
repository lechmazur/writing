<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is consistent but lacks psychological complexity; his transformation feels inevitable rather than earned through nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc compressed into tight word count; some transitions (e.g., months passing) feel slightly mechanical despite effective thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion in the lab atmosphere; occasional disconnect between technical details of plant communication research and the spiritual tone of mask restoration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Excellent use of metaphorical resonance (masks/plants as fragmented selves); ending achieves emotional closure without sentimentality; layered themes of connection/displacement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept weakened by occasional clich√©d phrasing ("whispering plants," "ancient wisdom") and slightly formulaic character growth; avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but isn't fully transcendent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements generally well-integrated with thematic unity, though the "nowhere became somewhere" resolution risks oversimplification; maintains lingering emotional resonance despite minor contrivances.</comment>
