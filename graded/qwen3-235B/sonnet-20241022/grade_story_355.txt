<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character shows emotional arc from aloofness to vulnerability, though initial detachment doesn't fully align with her visceral response to the letters. Motivation to free secrets is clear, but transitions abruptly from stated aloofness to physical expressiveness without sufficient nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows clear beginning (discovery of letters)-middle (installation interaction)-end (resolution at dawn) trajectory. The mapping of dreams concept ties chronology together, though pacing of emotional shifts feels slightly rushed in the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details about projections, balloon textures, and compass glass create immersive atmosphere. Tension between faded revelry and emerging truth is well-maintained, though timeframe constraint occasionally disrupts temporal continuity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "kaleidoscope of memories" and symbolic compass transformation demonstrate literary craft. Emotional subtext resonates through movement descriptions rather than exposition. Ending balances closure with thematic openness effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rejects clich√©s by exploring unexpected interplay between analog objects (letters, compass) and digital art. Avoids overly ornate language while maintaining lyrical precision. Emotional nuance emerges through physical gestures rather than abstract description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with only minor contrivance (balloon deflation as framing device slightly forced). Brevity enhances rather than limits story impact. Lingering questions about diaspora love story demonstrate thoughtful thematic resonance.</comment>
