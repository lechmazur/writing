<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from aloofness to purpose is telegraphed but lacks psychological depth; motivations are externally driven rather than inwardly explored, despite clear narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a discover-connect-reveal structure competently but compresses crucial revelations too neatly; loose ends (e.g., dock strike's broader impact) sacrifice tension for tidy resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (salt-stained pages, autumn haze) and spatial parallels between container maze and underwater structure; setting functions as a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of institutional amnesia and curiosity resonate, but emotional beats too often substituted with procedural exposition; dialogue and subtext remain underexploited.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in concept but relies on familiar "forgotten archive-mysterious artifact-obsessive discovery" beats; stylistically restrained but occasionally leans on conventional metaphors ("sleeping giants").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy; the brief format suits the mystery structure but limits character/philosophical exploration crucial for prestige markets.</comment>
