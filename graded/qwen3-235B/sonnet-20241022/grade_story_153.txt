<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but lacks internal conflict; motivations are clear but emotionally distant; the headlamp as an object reveals little about Marcus beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot functions as a static portrait rather than dynamic narrative; no clear arc but achieves thematic resolution through cyclical actions; pacing works for mood but lacks urgency despite apocalyptic setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (phosphorescent tunnels, ventilation systems) create immersive decay; atmosphere of existential resignation is masterfully maintained through environmental symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Philosophical subtext about mortality and memory resonates; "ordinary infinities" concept elevates closure beyond mere plot mechanics; precise imagery (trembling journal words, lukewarm coffee apocalypse) create lasting conceptual impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through focus on banal apocalypses; some phrasing risks pretension ("precious gems in darkness") but mostly restrained; emotional depth emerges through contextual irony rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into thematic unity rather than checklist assembly; brevity enhances elegiac tone; prompts reflection through cumulative juxtaposition of mundane and cosmic; structural limitations of form don't hinder artistic purpose.</comment>
