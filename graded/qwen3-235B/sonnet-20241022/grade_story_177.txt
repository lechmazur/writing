<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's rebellious motivation is clear but under-developed; actions align with traits but lack emotional depth; mask revelation feels unearned rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows logical progression but relies on contrived transitions; labyrinthine premise creates artificial tension rather than organic conflict; ending resolves too neatly for the revolutionary themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion through shifting mask expressions and resonant organ tones; revolution framing remains thematic backdrop rather than integrated element; bookshelf scale enhances atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors of fate-weaving offer conceptual richness; emotional resonance undermined by declarative summarizing ("realized," "understood") rather than visceral showing; thematic irony in unfinished obituaries.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by clich√©d revolutionary rhetoric and ornate descriptors ("labyrinth of shelves and stories"); mask's sentience risks tropeworlding without sufficient philosophical grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outpaces execution; assigned elements function mechanically rather than organically; atmospheric elements linger more than narrative cohesion or character impact.</comment>
