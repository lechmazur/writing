<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations tied to unresolved grief feel authentic, but the "shaky mercenary" aspect remains underexplored beyond initial tremors; emotional arc resolves effectively, though professional background lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion despite tight constraints, with recurring motifs (amber's shadows, echoing hour) creating structural symmetry; pacing slows naturally toward contemplative resolution without feeling forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Setting functions as both character and metaphor - decaying sacred space revitalized through art mirrors protagonist's search for meaning; synesthetic details (neon-tinged gargoyles, fossilized honey) create immersive dissonance between ruin and creation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Layers of subtext around art's redemptive power resonate without didacticism; imagery of trapped creatures (spider, father) and liminal spaces rewards multiple readings; ending achieves emotional resonance without tidy resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in unexpected juxtapositions (spray-painted saints, time-as-taffy); avoids clich√© through precision (gargoyles "neon-tinged" rather than neon); occasional metaphoric density risks becoming precious but never collapses into pure ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Every element serves as dual-purpose - amber symbolizes entrapment while driving plot; cathedral's decay becomes philosophical position; short form enhances rather than limits thematic potency through compressed intensity.</comment>
