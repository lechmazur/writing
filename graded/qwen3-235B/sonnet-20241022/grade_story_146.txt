<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent but underexplored; her "peaceful anger" manifests only superficially, lacking nuanced emotional layers to fully justify major decisions like crypt infiltration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; the hidden door discovery lacks buildup, and the leap from visions to physical artifact feels under-earned despite effective bookending with the planting season timeframe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details ("climate-controlled basement," "symbols dancing") vividly contrast the modern archive with the crypt's primal energy, though the medieval quarter's ambiance remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity vs. deception resonate, with symbolic flute-playing as a compelling metaphor; however, the ending's tidy resolution ("scholars forced to acknowledge") undercuts potential narrative bite.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains AI-like tendencies: disproportionately elaborate descriptions of the flute vs. sparse emotional interiority; the "simmering anger" feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively but safely; the "fraud-to-epiphany" arc is familiar, though the bone flute's integration elevates originality. Ending lingers thematically but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
