<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation shifts feel abrupt despite clear triggers; internal conflict is implied but lacks nuanced psychological depth; actions align with established traits but emotional evolution feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear arc within constraints; plot momentum driven by mitten discovery but altar exploration feels underdeveloped; pacing uneven between exposition and resolution; cause/effect connections present but occasionally mechanistic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Brutalist architecture vs. folk art contrast creates striking visual tension; midnight chill effectively mirrors character's internal conflict; sensory details like embroidered flowers and candlelight immerse reader; setting-object integration occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of cultural preservation vs institutional control resonate; emotional impact diluted by occasionally didactic delivery; symbolism (mitten as medicine pouch) potent but ending feels slightly overstated; strong imagery elevates craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains semi-generic phrases ("warmed by purpose"); some emotional beats could be shown rather than told; metaphors like grandmother's forgotten wisdom tread familiar ground; worldbuilding shows ingenuity but insufficiently explores contradictions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Element integration varies; brutalist secret center feels conceptually underutilized while candlelit altars gain thematic weight; length constraints manageably handled; lingering questions about institutional vs traditional knowledge systems suggest narrative depth.</comment>
