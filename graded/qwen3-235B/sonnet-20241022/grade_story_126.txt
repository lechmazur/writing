<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character serves as an environmental symbol more than a complex figure; motivations are clear but thin, actions align with premise but lack nuanced human psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear arc but compressed; ascending through the poster feels abrupt, cause/effect logical yet underdeveloped due to brevity; cohesion exists but lacks layered progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (moss, smells) contrast sterile/natural worlds effectively; rich atmosphere undermined by underexplored dystopian worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Creative use of metaphor (butter churn as life force) and resonant theme of ecological rebellion; emotional impact limited by sparse human connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with butter churn's transformation; some ornate prose but largely purposeful; atmospheric originality without feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but uneven in execution; elements serve theme but strain under brevity; leaves lingering impression but lacks narrative depth.</comment>
