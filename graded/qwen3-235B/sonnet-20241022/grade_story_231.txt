<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but rely heavily on exposition; the shepherd’s sentimental nature and spontaneity feel superficially applied rather than organically integrated into his decisions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing is strained by the tight word limit; cause-and-effect feels rushed (e.g., instant recognition of the heir), though the coordinates-to-secret-meeting link provides structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric but generic—Sumerian details are thin beyond names and ships; sensory immersion is minimal, weakening the atmosphere’s emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Themes of justice and chaos are stated more than shown; dialogue leans on clichés (“simplicity as truth”), though the hairpin and juxtaposition of the ship’s voyage with the hidden heir offer symbolic potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on tropes (hidden heir, humble hero) without subversion; writing avoids florid prose but occasionally defaults to predictable phrasing (“threads of justice,” “teaching power of chaos”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Hits most assigned elements, but cohesion is strained—e.g., the “chaotic humility” tone is underdeveloped, and the usurper’s ship feels tangential rather than thematically integrated.</comment>
