<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thistle's actions align with "gentle conjurer" and his joy/terror, but lacks depth in internal conflict or growth. Motivation to rebuild the garden is clear but underexplored beyond stated intent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (message → reassembly → restoration), but pacing feels rushed in middle sections. The reverse-message method drives initial action but fades in relevance, weakening structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (crystal lamps, granite, whispering roots) create vivid atmosphere. The underground setting connects meaningfully to dwarf culture and restoration theme, though surface forest timeframe shift feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (butterfly = rebirth) and metaphor ("tears of compassion") add depth. Ending conveys profound theme about shared trust but resolves conflict too neatly, reducing emotional resonance. Tension between secrecy and sharing is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality in stained glass mechanics and reversed illumination ideas, but falls into fantasy tropes (ancient prophecies, chosen saviors). Some phrases ("whispers of injustice") feel clichéd. Emotional beats often stated rather than shown (e.g., "joyful terror").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements competently but prioritizes aesthetic cohesion over narrative depth. Premise promises philosophical weight but sacrifices character nuance and thematic complexity due to tight word limit. Memorable imagery outpaces substantive meaning.</comment>
