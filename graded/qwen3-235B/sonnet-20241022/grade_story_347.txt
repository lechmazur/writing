<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dr. Chen's deception as a worker is consistent with her role, but her internal conflicts about liberating plants are underexplored, reducing emotional depth despite clear motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The constricting engine drives the plot, but the pacing feels rushed in resolving the plants' message and Elena's decoding process, leaving some cause-effect links underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (violin-string screech, chlorophyll-tinged whispers) immerse readers, though the biomechanical workshop’s logic could feel more coherent under its own rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (mercury droplets, infinite loops) and themes of exploitation/resistance resonate deeply. The ending’s thematic closure feels earned and emotionally precise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes by focusing on plant consciousness as both victim and collective agent. Some overwritten phrases ("photosynthetic consciousness") strain believability but don’t overwhelm originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All assigned elements are tightly woven into the narrative, though occasional poetic abstraction (e.g., "singularly multiple voices") risks undermining clarity for emotional impact.</comment>
