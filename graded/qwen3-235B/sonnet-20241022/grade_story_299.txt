<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marina’s uncertainty as champion is present but underdeveloped; her rationally rebellious trait is clear, but emotional depth feels surface-level. Her connection to the brooch hints at motivation but lacks visceral introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot arc is cohesive, but the transition from doubt to resolution in the brief word limit feels slightly rushed. The interconnected-path method drives the narrative logically, maintaining structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evoke setting through vivid chalk cliffs and amber motifs; “cheerful melancholy” permeates atmosphere. Strong sensory details, though some elements (e.g., carved studios) could be fleshed out for deeper immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like the brooch’s imperfections and river delta resonate. The theme of bridging tradition/modernity is clear, and the ending resonates emotionally. Subtlety in showing tension elevates impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but terms like “visual symphony” verge on abstraction. Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic. Emotional resonance leans on symbols (brooch) rather than fully embodied nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven but not without strain; the brevity enhances focus on Marina’s internal conflict. The theme lingers, but some components (e.g., cheerful gloom) lack full synthesis.</comment>
