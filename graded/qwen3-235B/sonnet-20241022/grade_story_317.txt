<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Nostalgia and duty are central motivations, but internal conflict lacks psychological depth; actions feel consistent but emotions remain more implied than explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing uneven in moments; crystal threat progression is logical, but Dr. Chen's sabotage is introduced abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with lunar dawn/levitation interplay; crystal refractions create immersive menace. Evocative details effectively ground readers in the tense, otherworldly setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Surface-level emotional resonance from Mars Station backstory; understatement works thematically but limits catharsis. The telescope as symbolic anchor adds subtle thematic cohesion between preservation and observation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Hazards of unchecked technological growth is familiar, but nostalgia-in-machines trope gains freshness from brass telescope juxtaposition. Some clich√©d phrases ("anxiously fearless determination") undermine nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically for functional narrative, though thematic integration varies. The brevity feels purposeful but sacrifices deeper exploration of core ideas like betrayal patterns or caretaker psychology.</comment>
