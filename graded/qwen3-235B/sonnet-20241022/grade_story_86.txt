<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's apprehension is clearly tied to family legacy, and her motivation to rescue truth drives her actions. However, emotional nuance beyond established traits feels underexplored, leaving some underdeveloped humanity in high-stakes moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tight structure merges setting, action, and theme effectively. Pacing balances quiet tension with climactic release. Slight abruptness in the great-grandmother reveal's integration, but cohesive arc from doubt to resolution maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neon-drenched servers contrasted with ancient candlelight creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory details (guttering flame against drone hum, prismatic shadows) immerse readers. Cyberpunk decay enhanced by cyclical temporal contrasts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (candle as fragile truth, arrows as correction) carries thematic weight. Ending's sunrise hope avoids sentimentality. Some explanatory paragraphs could be more "shown," but quiet revolutionary act lingers memorably.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through fusion of archaic/quantum elements. Metaphors (historical threads, digital decay) feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Language occasionally slips into poetic abstraction but maintains stylistic consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into unified metaphor for truth preservation. Time constraints masterfully handled - no superfluous language. Leaves philosophical resonance about responsibility to history.</comment>
