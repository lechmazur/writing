<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Maya's assertively meek personality is clearly established but feels underexplored; her decision to leave hinges on tech anxiety rather than her stated traits, weakening the thematic connection between her character and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong setup and resolution within constraints, but the abrupt portal transition disrupts pacing; cause/effect logic holds, though the oasis escape feels underdeveloped compared to earlier buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective sensory contrasts (desert heat vs. shimmering tapestry; smoke vs. digital screens) and evocative mirage imagery, though the oasis fantasy setting lacks depth to match the bar's nuanced atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry as escape, card as legacy) resonate emotionally, but the tech-vs-human theme leans on familiar contrasts without subverting expectations; prose is lyrical but occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-generated pitfalls, with vivid original details (e.g., "greeting card mocking her"), but employs predictable tropes (portal fantasy, declining small-town business) and slightly overwrought phrasing like "desperate optimism."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Engaging moment-to-moment but struggles with theme execution; cohesion exists, yet the ending’s symbolic weight feels undercut by the oasis’s underdeveloped contrast to the modern world.</comment>
