<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits influence her role as a sender of letters, but lacks internal conflict or complexity; motivations are clear but treated abstractly rather than through grounded actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Circular structure creates coherence but lacks plot momentum; cause-effect relationships between abstract revelations are underdeveloped due to emphasis on atmosphere over narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere merges decay with surreal time overlap; vivid sensory details (algae-thread, rusted zeppelin, cross-era broadcasts) immerse readers in a cohesive, liminal dream-space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors about reality as fiction and time as fluid resonate thematically, but emotional impact is diluted by philosophical exposition rather than earned through character dynamics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through original fusion of historical wreckage and metaphysical concepts; minimal purple prose, but occasional over-reliance on abstract phrases like "shared dream of this sunken giant."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements tightly into a cohesive mythos; brevity serves the recursive theme. Some ideas (e.g., ambassador's "fierceness") remain underexplored within the limited space.</comment>
