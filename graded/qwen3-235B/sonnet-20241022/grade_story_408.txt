<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Conscientious objector trait drives Marcus's decisions but lacks psychological depth; his shift to direct action feels under-motivated despite surface consistency; "valiantly bored" observation lacks nuanced characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains causal coherence within tight word limits, but the resolution's sudden heroism feels hastily integrated; storm timing as narrative device strains credulity slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storm-battered orchard's physicality and villagers' performative warmth create oppressive atmosphere through concrete sensory details; setting functions as both character and symbol.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marks migration routes as both literal/moral map effectively; some subtextual weight in "poisoned honey" metaphor, but emotional payoff remains intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally lapses into gothic trope echoes; "hungry shadows" and "welcoming wanderers" border on overfamiliar darkness without fully collapsing into genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically if occasionally mechanically; brief length emphasizes atmospheric tension over character interiority; nails-as-evidence device cleverly reframes horror trope.</comment>
