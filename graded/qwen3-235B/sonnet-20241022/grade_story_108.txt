<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; traits like "vexed" and "coy" are present but underexplored, relying more on plot function than psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure follows logic but feels rushed; transitions between elements (e.g., family tradition, fog mechanics) lack development, weakening narrative cohesion despite a clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic magical tropes; sparse sensory details fail to fully immerse readers in the Star Basin's lore or the fog's eerie mystique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Combines elements cleverly (e.g., spy pen) but leans on predictable tropes (doomed tradition, power-hungry antagonist); prose avoids excess but lacks distinctive stylistic flair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mechanically cohesive but lacks thematic ambition; elements are serviceable but some feel contrived (e.g., movie tradition), weakening overall impact.</comment>
