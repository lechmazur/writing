<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Maya’s role as a locksmith defines her actions but doesn’t deeply shape her personality or motivation; her jaded wonder is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior, and her transformation into a preserver of dances feels abrupt without stronger emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc (quest → resolution), but pacing feels slightly rushed in the middle, with the dancers’ desperation and Maya’s memorization of steps underdeveloped; the storm of secrets as a plot device lacks concrete cause-effect linkage.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (salty air, shifting plates, oak’s shedding) immerse readers in a haunting, metaphysical setting; the atmosphere of decay and urgency complements the tone, though the driftwood platform’s physics remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (dancing as preservation) are conceptually rich, but emotional resonance is diluted by summary over showing; the ending feels purposeful but relies on the reader filling in gaps about Maya’s inner transformation, weakening its impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar “lost civilization” tropes without subverting them; some phrases (“jaded wonder,” “storm of secrets”) feel vague; the story’s ambition is clear, but execution lacks the razor-sharp specificity to elevate it beyond genre fiction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative, but the tight word limit strains deeper integration; the floating orchard’s stakes feel urgent on the surface but lack existential weight beyond the dancers’ abstract “knowledge”; the theme of lost magic lingers, albeit faintly.</comment>
