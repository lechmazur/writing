<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's melancholy is clear but underdeveloped; transformation lacks emotional depth despite symbolic sewing needle. Dialogue tone inconsistent with "bored excitement" motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot driven by blackout and ancient systems activation; pacing slightly rushed but achieves arc from despair to renewal. Sudden machinery activation lacks prior buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lavishly austere" observatory underutilized; sensory details present but generic. Solar flare impact on city absent, weakening atmospheric contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical connection between Darius' transformation and changing stars resonates; ending thematic but understated. Subtext of static vs. dynamic existence well-woven, though emotional payoff muted.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through cosmic metamorphosis concept, but "ancient system reveals the truth" trope needs subversion. Needle use original; occasional generic descriptors ("ghostly projections") detract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly weighted; observatory setting feels incidental. Ending lingers conceptually but misses visceral impact. Time constraint strains secondary character depth.</comment>
