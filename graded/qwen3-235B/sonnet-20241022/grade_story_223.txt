<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>James’ seasickness is consistent but underexplored; his “awkward charm” influences his selection but lacks narrative demonstration. Emotional stakes remain vague despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing oscillates between lyrical introspection and abrupt plot beats; the moon-phase method feels underutilized as a functional mechanic. The arc to the mirror’s destruction is coherent but rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (e.g., “prismatic halls,” “crystal walls humming”) create a haunting atmosphere that deeply enhances the mythic tone. Slightly over-reliant on color descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mirror-as-collective-lie metaphor is potent but undercut by abstract emotional beats. The ending’s thematic resolution—truth’s liberation—is moving, though lacks visceral character grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar mystical trope frameworks (e.g., “whispered secrets,” “centuries of longing”). Language is poetic but occasionally teeters into overwrought territory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but unevenly weighted; the fortress and orchid feel integral while “traded secrets” and “awkward charm” lack narrative urgency. Strong atmosphere compensates for minor structural gaps.</comment>
