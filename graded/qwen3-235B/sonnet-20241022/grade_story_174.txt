<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation to correct her regret drives her actions, but her character lacks layered emotional complexity; her transformation relies too heavily on symbolic elements rather than organic introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained through recurring patterns, but the library’s sudden revelation and compressed timeline feel contrived; the resolution is satisfying but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, blending sensory details (frost, moss, water) with poetic metaphors; the hidden library’s ethereal quality and interplay of light/time amplify emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and symbolism effectively (frost/leaves/fireworks as cyclical motifs), but the theme of legacy risks sentimentality; lacks subtext exploring creativity’s cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in concept, but some phrasing (e.g., “sky-painters”) veers toward poetic abstraction; the library’s “puzzle” mechanism feels slightly formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically, though the hidden library’s abrupt integration strains logic; prose is lyrical but occasionally prioritizes imagery over narrative momentum.</comment>
