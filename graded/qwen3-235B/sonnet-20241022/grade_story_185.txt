<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; her 'peculiar collector' identity feels imposed rather than organically tied to deeper psychological layers. Calmness lacks complexity as a defining trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but suffers from compressed pacing; decoding piano keys to 'tweak' probabilities strains plausibility within tight constraints. Ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere of quantum-digital contrast is vividly rendered through crystalline windows and probability waves, but sensory details about the piano bench and pencil remain perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'matrices fracturing like ice' and the pencil-as-monument create strong emotional resonance. Theme of human imperfection vs digital perfection emerges coherently.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in combining quantum theory with analog artifacts, but some phrases ('beautiful chaos') veer into overused territory. Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally uses overly ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around theme but feel occasionally overstuffed; compression works for momentum but sacrifices deeper exploration. Lingering impact comes from concept rather than execution.</comment>
