<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's daydreaming and academic traits are present but underdeveloped. Motivation for creating a "masterpiece" feels stated rather than earned. Reactions to the satellite and code lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed. The decoding process is under-explained, leaving gaps between discovery and conclusion. Pacing is uneven; some sections rush while others meander.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Submerged palace setting is vivid but underutilized—its connection to "cursed waters" and decay feels surface-level. Sensory details (silt, radioactive sheen) enhance atmosphere but lack emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thematic potential ("compassion as code") is hampered by abstraction. Metaphors lack emotional grounding—readers are told Marina feels "truth" but not shown its visceral impact. The ending lacks resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (hidden codes, lone genius scholar) without subverting them. Language occasionally slips into ornate description ("pristine chaos") and predictable emotional cues instead of nuanced characterization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively threaded but inconsistently weighted. The speculative premise outpaces human-scale stakes, leaving the story feeling conceptually ambitious but emotionally distant.</comment>
