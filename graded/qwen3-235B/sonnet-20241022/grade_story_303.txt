<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weak emotional interiority; motivations inferred but not deeply explored. The pilot-to-cartographer transition feels underdeveloped yet consistent with her stated longing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragmented progression; tension between contemplative moments and plot movement. The portal's activation lacks urgency despite high-concept stakes. Beginning/end symmetry exists but feels preordained rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Tactile specificity in sensory details (cinnamon scent, glass textures) masterfully grounds the fantastical premise. Timeframes blurred through dimension-jumping paradoxically enhances temporal unease.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (trade routes/spice as consciousness connectors) are insightful but occasionally overwritten. The "jazz improvisation" analogy crystallizes quantum chaos more effectively than poetic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction ("iridescent shadows") that feels self-satisfied. Subtext about home resonates through repetitive spice rack imagery rather than predictable emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements present but not uniformly impactful. The brevity works for thematic efficiency but limits deeper exploration of dimension-hopping's existential consequences.</comment>
