<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Poor internalization weakens Marcus’s emotional depth; motivations stated more than demonstrated through conflict/resolution. The “broken zipper” functions better as plot device than character trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abstract ideas rather than causal stakes; progression from observation → theory → dissemination feels intellectualized, lacking narrative urgency or tangible consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting’s sterile conformity contrasts with nebula’s mystery, but sensory details lean generic (swirling purple-orange clouds, nebula “hush”). Atmosphere lacks visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity vs. conformity resonate; subtext in commodified “magic” and mythology-as-rebellion is effective. Ending ties to character arc but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés; premise is conceptually fresh. Language balances precision (e.g., “virus of enlightenment”) and restraint. Nuanced handling of irony in protagonist’s anonymity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere theoretically but strain under brevity; some threads (e.g., space dust as social experiment) underexplored. Lingering thematic resonance partially compensates for narrative brevity.</comment>
