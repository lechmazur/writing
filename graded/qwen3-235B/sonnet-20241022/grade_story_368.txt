<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's street-smart instincts anchor her actions, but inner conflict and emotional depth remain underexplored. Her transition from survivalist to temple keeper feels earned yet lacks nuanced vulnerability beneath the thematic elegance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows with fable-like economy, but the leap from city scavenger to temple guardian skirts over significant emotional and logistical gaps. The circular structure is elegant but occasionally sacrifices narrative weight for poetic brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush, synesthetic details (honey-time, "fruit-laden vines") create visceral immersion. The unwritten calendar's implications for atmosphere are profound but under-utilized in character interactions beyond aesthetic description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("thread pulled from a tapestry") illuminate themes, but emotional payoff remains abstract. The ending resonates intellectually more than viscerally, occasionally prioritizing lyrical elegance over raw character truth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s through inverted symbolism (cursed became blessing), yet the mystical temple trope and "chosen one" arc flirt with narrative familiarity. Prose balances economy and beauty but occasionally leans on ornate abstraction where grittier specifics might deepen impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces into a unified myth-logic despite tight word limits. Assigned elements serve dual symbolic and plot functions, though thematic density occasionally overshadows raw human authenticity. Leaves lingering philosophical questions while feeling emotionally provisional.</comment>
