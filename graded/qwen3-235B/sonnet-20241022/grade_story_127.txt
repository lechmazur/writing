<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strengths in dual identity conflict; underdeveloped emotional resonance in secret revealing gradual vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory as engine effective but pacing stumbles in transition from static lounge to high-stakes past; resolution telescopes too neatly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Steampunk accoutrements vividly placed but atmospheric cohesion strained by underexplored contrastsâ€”mechanical vs organic, claustrophobia vs expansive memory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in steampunk-mourning synthesis undercut by predictable emotional beats; occasional purple prose ("hollow as salvage pods") disrupts nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly organic with minor mechanical interjections; ending achieves thematic closure but risks sentimental oversimplification within constrained form.</comment>
