<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivations are vaguely implied through actions but lack depth; "consistently strange" attribute shapes behavior superficially without exploring emotional or psychological roots; dialogue feels performative rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven – exposition heavy early but races to underdeveloped thematic conclusion; cause-effect of machinery activating via performance strains plausibility; circular structure works within constraints but resolution feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rare spices and lab decay create rich olfactory contrasts; visual/tactile details like bent ruler and calcium performers anchor the surreal; atmosphere occasionally undermined by overreliance on "carnival/funeral" juxtaposition cliché.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in transforming mortality into art; subtext about legacy vs. impermanence resonates; dialogue feels slightly didactic but final image of cosmic laughter creates haunting, thought-provoking closure; sensory show-don't-tell mostly effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but has AI-like tendencies – "beautifully bizarre" recurs excessively; some metaphors ("invisible scarves") border on overused; emotional progression feels slightly diagrammatic despite deft thematic weaving.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully integrated (skulls as both props/memento mori) but certain choices (spice navigation) seem convenience-driven; experimental tone cohesive but occasional ornate phrasing disrupts flow; leaves thematic questions but lacks gut-level emotional punch.</comment>
