<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (decoding grandmother's work, scientific curiosity) are clear, but psychological depth remains superficial. Actions align with traits but lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive arc within constraints; decoding coffee grounds serves as plot pivot but feels somewhat contrived. Pacing tight yet logical progression exists despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Peruvian coastal dawn vividly rendered through sensory details (barnacles, keyboard shadows, solar panel hum). Atmosphere masterfully merges scientific realism and maritime mysticism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (medical vs. ancient knowledge) and recursive patterns create thematic resonance. Ending resonates thematically but emotional impact lacks transcendent execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique combinations (coffee ground divination), but "tortured scholar" trope and exposition-heavy internal monologue border on conventionality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrated effectively but not innovatively. Limited thematic expansion due to word count constraints; concept fulfillment prioritized over deeper exploration.</comment>
