<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Miranda's motivation—combining duty with personal curiosity—is clear but lacks deeper exploration of her internal conflict. The "carefully careless" attribute applies more to the mansion's owner than her own motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive, with the dog’s escape initiating the inciting incident and the journal’s discovery anchoring the resolution. Pacing is brisk yet effective, though the blood drive backstory feels underutilized within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust-draped chandeliers, thick silence) and eerie twilight setting create an immersive, haunting atmosphere. The botanical collection’s connection to supernatural secrets enhances both mood and thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The metaphor of "truths blooming in darkness" and the mansion-as-curator motif add layers of meaning. Emotional subtext is implied through action and setting rather than overt telling, but some passages verge on abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subverts haunted mansion tropes through the lens of a dog walker and botanical horror. Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on Gothic shorthand (e.g., "whimper," "pulsed with energy") instead of deeper originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All elements are tightly woven into the narrative, though the blood drive backstory feels like a narrative add-on. The concise format serves the story’s focus on atmosphere and theme, leaving a lingering sense of quiet menace.</comment>
