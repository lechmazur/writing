<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape mundanity is clear, but Marcus's personality remains mostly abstract — his actions serve thematic goals rather than revealing distinct traits or complex inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a coherent arc of rejuvenation, but the mystical transformation unfolds through poetic abstraction rather than logical cause-effect, occasionally undermining narrative momentum within the constrained length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (tactile descriptions of meteorite texture, glowing objects) create an immersive atmosphere that deeply intertwines with character motivation and thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses poetic imagery effectively to evoke introspection and thematic depth, though occasionally sacrifices narrative urgency for lyrical prose; ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains traces of familiar mystical revival tropes (magic artifacts, fading lute music); sensory details and metaphors are inventive, though some phrasing borders on ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but occasionally prioritize atmosphere over narrative precision; the brevity effectively highlights thematic contrasts but limits full exploration of character transformation.</comment>
