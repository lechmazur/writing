<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Characters exist but remain emotionally distant; motivations (Yumi's coded rituals, Kenji's unconscious mimicry) feel narratively imposed rather than naturally developed through behavior. Reactions to celestial patterns/herbalism lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot moves from observation to convergence, but meteor shower arc feels inevitable rather than earned. Pacing manages multiple timelines but sacrifices specific milestones; abrupt cosmic resolution lacks grounded emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Castle's duality as ancient/modern setting is evocative but underutilized. Atmosphere benefits from floral/celestial details but could expand sensory contrasts between old beams and art supplies, night sky and indoor spaces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors linking art/healing are conceptually rich but emotionally muted. Ending lacks satisfying tension release despite clever celestial-botanical parallels. Central theme emerges but lacks visceral impact due to restrained prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s by combining herbalism with cosmic symbolism. Sensory details are vivid but sparse; some phrases ("unspoken conversation") lean on abstraction over specificity. Emotional resonance feels deliberately withheld rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Strong conceptual cohesion but uneven execution. Assigned elements integrate creatively (flower book's coded legacy) yet occasionally serve as symbolic scaffolding rather than narrative necessities. Lingering interest lies in hybridized traditions.</grade>
