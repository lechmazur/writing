<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear (buried hatred resurfacing), and the mixtape and sticker sheet meaningfully reveal internal conflict. However, the emotional shift feels slightly rushed despite strong setup in her 30-year history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical (discovery → playback → decision) with good cause/effect, but the transition from hatred-driven to preservationist feels compressed within the word limit despite evocative details.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (whirring servers, brass fixtures) create immersion. The steampunk setting complements the analog vs. digital contrast, though the timeframe's "hush" feels slightly abstract rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of emotional preservation over destruction resonate. Effective symbolism with sticker sheet as redemption artifact. Ending feels earned but could heighten subtext about institutional memory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-tropes with mechanical specifics, but phrases like "copper eyes" and "mechanical whispers" flirt with overused steampunk imagery. Subtext feels human-nuanced despite some ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements serve theme tightly (mixtapes as memory vessels, steampunk's analog nostalgia). Slight formulaic beats in emotional arc, but lingering questions about institutional erasure vs. personal reconciliation provide depth.</comment>
