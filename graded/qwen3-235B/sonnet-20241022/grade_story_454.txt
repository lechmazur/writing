<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivations are clear but character psychology remains shallow; Marcus' actions align with his role but lack complexity, while his partner's orchestrated plan feels under-earned despite brief hints at "rationally emotional" nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies on improbable conveniences (gang enabling reunion); the synchronized watch gimmick drives momentum effectively, though the map-as-macguffin resolution strains credibility within the compressed scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Haunted funhouse atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details (mirror warps, carnival music) and successfully contrasts dread with hope; however, the Singapore connection and gang's presence feel under-integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (twisted mirrors, mended map) elevate themes of duality and reunion; emotional resonance is unevenâ€”mechanical descriptions of "hope" and "dread" undercut subtler moments like the laugh echo's symbolic power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through clever role reversal (gang as facilitators, not villains) and specific details (clover symbolism), but occasionally relies on AI-esque abstractions ("infinite versions" phrasing); tone remains consistent but lacks audacious risks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack deeper thematic unity; the brevity feels limiting in character development moments, though the twist's efficiency and memorable imagery (synchronized watches, duality motif) suggest intentional design.</comment>
