<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and connection to railways is clear, but emotional depth beyond grief remains underexplored. Obsession drives actions, but personality remains diffuse despite symbolic use of the hairbrush.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot ties beginning to end effectively, but pacing stumbles during the hospital call's abrupt insertion. Assigned concept (mapping railways) drives structure, though the word limit strains temporal connections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radio wave garden creates vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details (static, metallic echoes) immerse readers, with setting deeply tied to character motivation and plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through symbolism and subtext ("electromagnetic lullaby"). Ending balances closure and thematic weight, though dialogue absence limits voice differentiation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (water tower as memory vessel) offset minimal clich√©s. Some ornate phrasing ("defunct satellite dishes bloomed like metal flowers") risks pretension but generally serves atmosphere without becoming excessive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere around central metaphor, but brevity occasionally forces contrivance (mother's timing). Leaves lingering questions about memory vs. progress, suggesting depth beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
