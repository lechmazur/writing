<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's analytical gift is shown through action but lacks emotional depth; motivations to restore justice feel perfunctory without concrete personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from decryption to revelation, but the rain-triggered decryption method strains credibility, and the short length leaves the resolution feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (petrichor, decaying party remnants) create mood, but the setting's bureaucratic secrecy feels underexplored as a narrative device.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. deception are present but underdeveloped; the ending hints at societal impact without showing it, sacrificing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise with psychometric decryption, but the chalice's "hidden in plain sight" resolution relies on a trope; avoids purple prose but occasionally slips into overabstract metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, but the story leans on conceptual intrigue rather than emotional engagement; the brevity works thematically but limits narrative weight.</comment>
