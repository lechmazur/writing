<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is stated but remains underdeveloped. Her "smiling saboteur" element manifests once, lacking psychological complexity or evolution. Emotional resonance is sacrificed for thematic exposition, with reactions to mannequins feeling more symbolic than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot structure establishes a through-line from sabotage to stellar channeling, but pacing feels rushed in critical moments (e.g., mannequins’ activation). Cause-effect logic (imperfections conducting energy) is inconsistently explained, weakening coherence despite a clear beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting details (rust, crumbled mannequins, fractured city) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that mirrors the theme. Sensory specifics about light, decay, and sound are evocative, though the star’s "wrath" feels conceptually separate from the gorge-bound city’s physicality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Literary devices (mannequins as symbols of imperfection, stellar energy as transformation) are strong, but emotional engagement is uneven. The ending’s thematic clarity sacrifices narrative ambiguity, and “showing” is undercut by overt statements like “Maya had learned perfection was an illusion.”</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>While the mannequin/star concept is original, frequent abstract phrases (“the star’s fury poured through vessels”) lean toward poesy over specificity. Transitions between action and reflection sometimes feel formulaic, with metaphors occasionally veering into cliché (e.g., “broken beauty”).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted—setting shines, while character and tone feel secondary. The brief length works for urgency but limits thematic depth. Lingering resonance is present but primarily atmospheric, not emotional.</comment>
