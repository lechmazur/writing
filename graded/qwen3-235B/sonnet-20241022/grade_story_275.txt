<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent in her devotion but lacks depth; motivations are clear but remain abstract, making emotional investment difficult. The hermit’s inner conflict between preservation and inevitability feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Limited by word count but maintains structural coherence. The plot’s arc—from documenting decay to departure—feels abrupt; the urgency of the comet’s approach isn’t fully integrated into the pacing. Ending provides thematic closure but lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually rich, immersive setting with vivid sensory details (celestial fire, skeletal trees, metallic roses). Occasionally veers into overwrought description, slightly diluting the atmosphere’s emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative central idea and metaphors (e.g., “practical resurrection”), but emotional impact is muted by detached prose. Subtext about adaptation is strong, though the story leans heavily on abstract themes without grounding them in visceral moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Original premise but suffers from uneven prose: some paragraphs dazzle with specificity, others lapse into clichéd phrasing (“dying land,” “relentless gaze”). Avoids major tropes but occasionally substitutes novelty for depth—e.g., metallic roses feel more symbolic than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story excels in conceptual ambition and atmospheric cohesion but lacks narrative urgency and emotional stakes. The assigned elements are deftly woven yet occasionally feel like checklist items rather than organic components of a unified whole. Memorable but not transcendent.</comment>
