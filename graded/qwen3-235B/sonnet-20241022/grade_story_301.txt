<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Philosopher lacks emotional depth; motivations stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior. Ethically questionable actions remain surface-level without exploring psychological consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression through knitting is coherent but slightly rushed; final revelation lacks visceral impact. Cause-effect between symbols and cosmic unraveling is logical but undersold.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid jazz-age details (Victrola's "mechanical heartbeat," art deco) juxtapose effectively with cosmic themes. Time capsule feel enhances the anachronistic tension between mundane and supernatural.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evokes unease through tactile symbols and detached narration. Subtext about obsession vs. enlightenment is present but thinly explored. Ending hints at thematic resonance without full payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original premise combines metaphysics with tactile craft. Avoids genre clichés through specific imagery (e.g., glyph twisting "impossibly"). Some detached narration weakens emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel compartmentalized—setting dazzles, cosmic stakes lack tangible stakes. The brevity undermines deeper exploration of character or concept.</comment>
