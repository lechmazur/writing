<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Constance's motivation of recovering recipes drives action but lacks emotional depth; her aristocratic background informs decisions but inner conflicts remain underexplored; reactions align with plot but don't reveal layered personality</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from approach to ascent to descent exists, but secondary timeline descriptions disrupt pacing; cause-effect between legacy burden and recipe recovery is logical but temporal mechanics muddy coherence</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between decay (rusted metal, patched coat) and otherworldliness (shifting illustrations, phantom diners) create immersive atmosphere; setting actively shapes action through liminal space concept</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Effective literary devices (culinary magic as legacy metaphor) and layered meanings enhance impact; ending balances ambivalence but emotional resonance remains surface-level despite evocative imagery</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unique blend of culinary and supernatural elements avoids genre tropes, but some ornate descriptions (e.g., "realistically odd" character trait) border on purple prose; emotional subtext exists but could be more nuanced</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively (botanical art ↔ recipes ↔ temporal shifts) despite genre conventions; brief length serves mystical vignette concept but sacrifices character depth; distinctive voice elevates marketability</comment>
