<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chen's softhearted nature is stated but underdemonstrated; her actions feel narratively convenient rather than organically tied to her traits, with the belt buckle serving more as symbolic shorthand than a meaningful motivator.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chronology is clear but rushed; the planetarium's role as both catalyst and resolution feels underdeveloped, though the beginning/end symmetry (dust/activation) creates minimal cohesion within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gritty neon vs. organic decay juxtaposition works well; sensory details like "digital smog" and "artificial constellations" effectively immerse, though the cyberpunk station's integration with thematic elements feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (belt buckles as humanity anchors, planetarium as narrative loom) add depth; the "end of storytelling" concept is conceptually engaging but emotionally thin; the ending resonates through symbolic synthesis rather than earned impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on semi-familiar "tech-faith-balance" narratives; descriptions occasionally default to generic cyberpunk qualifiers ("digital skin"); character motivation has human nuance but feels slightly overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematic whole but with mechanical seamlessness; the short form serves the intimate scope well but sacrifices emotional buildup; leaves a contemplative but not transformative impression.</comment>
