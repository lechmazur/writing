<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Patiently developed paradoxical traits (hopeful naivety vs cleverness) guide actions, but interiority feels slightly distant; motivations are clear but lack nuanced evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Puzzle piece mechanics drive progression coherently, but pivotal synchronization lacks tangible stakes; circular maze-to-orchard transition elegant yet under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with crystalline fruit and sentient trees creates hauntingly poetic atmosphere that flawlessly embodies thematic duality of loss/redemption.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mix of sublime metaphor ("liquid starlight") and slightly overwrought declarations ("exquisite pain") creates potent but uneven emotional resonance; central conflict remains poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids most genre tropes through frequency-based magic system and psychological layering; occasional ornateness doesn't undermine consistently inventive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesion amid technical requirements is impressive; brevity serves mythic tone but limits emotional payoff's complexity; leaves haunting question about fragmented selves.</comment>
