<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Characters are distinct with clear motivations, but emotional transformation feels slightly rushed. Dialogue reveals personality effectively through sardonic wit, though deeper nuance is missing in pivotal emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong three-act structure within constraints, with cause-effect clear between confrontation and resolution. Pacing is generally tight, though the emotional pivot relies slightly on summary rather than fully dramatized progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, specific sensory details (dust motes, candlelight, chair's impression) create immersive atmosphere. Static setting meaningfully reflects thematic concerns. Timelessness feels organically connected to emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (frozen time/family refusal to heal) and emotionally resonant ending. Subtext exists but could be richer - some emotional beats told rather than fully shown through nuanced action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formula through thematic subversion of "magical heirloom" trope. Fresh take on healing across generations. Minor ornate phrasing appears but doesn't dominate. Emotional complexity feels authentically human rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion in element integration. Brief format used deliberately to highlight generational tension. Conceptual depth lingers beyond immediate narrative through resonant metaphor and character dynamic.</comment>
