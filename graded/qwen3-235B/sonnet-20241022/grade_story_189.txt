<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Maya's determination and curiosity are evident but her character lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but driven more by plot necessity than human complexity; her distinctive voice is minimally realized through action rather than internal monologue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression from discovery to activation, but the compressed structure leaves little room for tension development; cause-and-effect between key insertion and holographic activation is abrupt; pacing manages to feel complete within constraints but lacks subtlety in transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Post-war desolation contrasts intriguingly with the lighthouse's archaic mystery, but sensory details feel selectively applied rather than immersive; the "writhing shadows" hint at atmosphere but aren't fully integrated beyond superficial tension; connection between water scarcity and star-based salvation is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Successfully blends mythic undertones with sci-fi elements, creating thematic resonance about humanity's cyclical reliance on external knowledge; the ending sacrifices philosophical depth for action resolution; uses holographic imagery effectively but relies on surface-level symbolism rather than layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique combinations (phone booth key + celestial beacon) but exhibits occasional mechanical phrasing ("spidery hand that seemed to glow faintly"); emotional stakes remain abstract; tone maintains consistency but could be bolder in subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration leans toward functional rather than inventive; the story's brevity serves the mythic tone but sacrifices character nuance; raises intriguing questions about cyclical history but resolves them too conveniently; shows technical competence rather than literary distinction.</comment>
