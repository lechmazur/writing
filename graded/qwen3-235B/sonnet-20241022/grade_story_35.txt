<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear but remains static; her reactions to the purse hint at depth but lack exploration of internal conflict or transformation. The quiet gardener trait shapes her actions but doesn't fully distinguish her as a character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherence maintained through thematic threads, but lacks a traditional arc. Pacing suits the contemplative tone, though cause-effect relationships between recovered memories and present actions remain underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details ground the atmospheric rooftop garden. The translation center's purpose is implied rather than shown, weakening its connection to the characters' work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The garden-as-dictionary metaphor is powerful, and the story's subtext about universal emotions resonates. Subtlety risks underwhelming impact, and the ending's thematic weight outpaces narrative tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in its core concept but leans on familiar motifs (heirloom triggering memories). Writing is lyrical without veering into purple prose, though emotional nuance occasionally feels abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency. The story's strength lies in its conceptual freshness and atmospheric execution, though it would benefit from deeper character stakes.</comment>
