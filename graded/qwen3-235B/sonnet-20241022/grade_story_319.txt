<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s frailty and conflicted loyalty anchor motivations but underexploit psychological complexity; wavering resolve feels schematic rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear arc, but pacing occasionally strains coherence (e.g., abrupt shift to sleeping guards); causeway’s symbolic weight compensates for brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere with sensory precision; tidal island’s liminality enhances tension, though some details verge on clichéd decay (gnarled oak, salt spray).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (carved trees as “silent witnesses”) deepen themes; emotional resonance undercut by sentimental phrasing (“grief for the system,” “lift from shoulders”).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but leans on familiar rebellion arcs; “frail guard” and phial inject originality, while “hopeful melancholy” occasionally succumbs to predictable poeticizing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive, with strained moments (painted allegiances underused); brevity feels intentional but sacrifices deeper thematic payoff.</comment>
