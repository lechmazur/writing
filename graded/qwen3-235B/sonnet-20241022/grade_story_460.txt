<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits (quiet wisdom, stubbornness) are present but motivations lack layered exploration beyond symbolic preservation of knowledge; reactions to puzzle pieces show role but not depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot exists as a thematic meditation rather than action-driven arc; coherence maintained but lacks traditional progression or resolution within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poisonous atmosphere and bioengineered fungi create vivid sensory immersion; setting enhances symbolic use of decay and resilience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose ("acids of survival," wisdom as puzzle fragments) elevates theme; ending reinforces circularity of rebuilding without overt sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in framing choice as tactile memory in objects; occasional phrases (e.g., "corrosive mists") border on overwrought abstraction; avoids most algorithmic markers but tone risks becoming a sustained mood poem.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements merge organically despite constrained format; brevity works thematically but limits emotional escalation; conceptually polished but lacks visceral narrative stakes.</comment>
