<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is surface-level; groggy brewer trope feels underdeveloped. Actions lack psychological depth despite attempts at "flippant solemnity."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc but relies on contrivance (e.g., "hops-scented dust"). Pacing uneven; protest framing feels tacked on rather than integral.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is inconsistent—haunted mansion clichés clash with pseudo-intellectual beer metaphors. Sensory details often arbitrary ("darkness...chewable").</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Voice occasionally shines with dark humor but fails to explore deeper themes. Ending feels self-congratulatory rather than impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>Riddled with formulaic phrasing ("encroaching darkness," "self-reflection" parallels). Relies on overused tropes without subversion; metaphors feel forced and unoriginal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elements assembled like checklist items rather than organic components. Style over substance; no lasting resonance beyond gimmickry.</comment>
