<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Flat emotional depth undermines Marcus' motivations beyond his deafness and mother's legacy; his "docile bruiser" persona blends physical gentleness with plot-driven resolve but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Expedited pacing strains resolution, but the twist connecting the baton to plant revival maintains narrative symmetry; cause-effect logic holds despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visceral contrasts between decaying greenhouse and drum solos create atmosphere, but sensory details uneven (e.g., vibrations through floor poorly contextualized as musical substitute).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical resonance in rebirth motif; ending subverts zombie trope elegantly but leans on underdeveloped symbols (mother's gestures, drum parallels).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI crutches but relies on familiar "mythic artifact" scaffolding; prose occasionally veers toward melodrama (e.g., "quiet magic") without earning it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under narrative brevity; theme lingers thematically rather than viscerally, with structural efficiency outweighing emotional complexity.</comment>
