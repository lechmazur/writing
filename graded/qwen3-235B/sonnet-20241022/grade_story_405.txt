<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's gambling background inconsistently informs his decisions; grief-driven sanctuary creation lacks visceral emotional resonance; subtle shifts between mistrust and protective guardianship feel underdeveloped despite cryptic codes shaping his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through incident-driven arrival of refugees but lacks narrative arc; abrupt transition from mushroom farmer to "silent guardian" weakens thematic cohesion; mathematical codes as plot engine lack resolution despite subway scrawls' promise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi create vivid visual atmosphere but other senses (humidity's weight, petal textures) underutilized; setting's fungal network "lights" concept poorly exploited beyond aesthetics; sanctuary's claustrophobia inconsistently evoked.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cryptic codes as Sarah's posthumous communication device offers symbolic depth; "frantic mission of salvation" conceptually rich but emotional payoff diluted by passive character portrayal; ending's "trust in the unexplained" theme feels under-earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original premise (subterranean refugee network via mushroom farm) subverts underground shelter clichés; overwrought lines ("uncharted grief") and inconsistent sensory detail (petals' "energy") suggest formulaic impulses; character subtext occasionally drowned by poetic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements (gambling, petals, codes) interconnect but lack narrative dominance; brief length exposes underdeveloped transitions (e.g., recipe tester → sanctuary architect); thematic tension between control and surrender remains tantalizingly partial.</comment>
