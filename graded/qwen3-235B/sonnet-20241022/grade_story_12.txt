<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aloofness informs Marcus's behavior but lacks nuanced exploration of how this trait shapes his cartography or relationship with Yuki; motivations around bridging analog/digital worlds feel underdeveloped despite surface consistency</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Meandering tone with limited plot progression; neural connection/expansion action drives some emotional evolution but repetitive kayaking metaphors create cyclical inertia rather than meaningful arc within confined structure</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Futuristic shopping mall setting provides visual scaffolding but sensory details feel generic (holographic shoppers, blue light); failed opportunity to contrast sterile commercialism with tactile tile memories</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some purple prose tendencies (e.g., "ink bleeding across wet paper"); fresh angle in mapping consciousness rather than space, but emotional beats about kayaking memories verge on clich√©</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegantly conceived premise lingers thematically even if plot progression stalls; structural coherence maintained but fails to transcend genre expectations into truly groundbreaking territory</comment>
