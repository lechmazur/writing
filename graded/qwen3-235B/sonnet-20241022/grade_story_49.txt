<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Superficially defined motivation, abrupt character transformation lacks emotional groundwork despite effective use of the doormat as memory anchor. Voice remains generic despite first-person potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure works but pacing uneven - critical magical awakening feels rushed. Cause-effect between shadow patterns and lunar-Earth light synergy remains under-explained within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through contrast of sterile lunar setting vs tactile Earth remnants. Underutilized potential in sensory contrast between "charred serenity" and stage fog's ethereality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Memorable core concept undermined by predictable "chosen one" arc. Effective metaphors (light/darkness as memory conduits) countered by cliché "true temperature" ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but falters in emotional subtext - magic activation relies on tell-not-show through "heart thundering" vs physical reactions. Stilted spatial descriptions (e.g., "artificial twilight") suggest algorithmic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element cohesion impressive but surface-level - lunar-Earth duality feels conceptually necessary rather than organically developed. Brevity enhances mystical revelation but undermines character depth.</comment>
