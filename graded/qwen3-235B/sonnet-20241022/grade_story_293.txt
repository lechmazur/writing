<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's nervousness and lack of sincerity are clear but lack depth; motivations are coherent but underdeveloped beyond surface rebellion and symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and contained, but key beats (e.g., bluffing guards) are glossed over, leaving structural gaps; ending feels abrupt despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Immersion is strong via vivid bacterial-city imagery and star patterns; atmospheric contrasts enhance theme, but some details (e.g., "phosphorescent night") lean overly descriptive without deeper function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and symbolic objects (lute, photo) deepen impact; thematic consistency between setting and character’s arc is strong, but emotional nuance in Marcus’ final act is slightly generic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in merging sci-fi and artistic rebellion shines, but phrases like "artificial as processed air" and "carefully curated lies" verge on cliché; tone wavers between poetic and mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively, but the story leans on surface-level contrasts (order vs. freedom) without subverting genre expectations; brevity is effective but sacrifices complexity.</comment>
