<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations remain underdeveloped; Marcus's transition from jaded to engaged lacks nuanced reasoning. Eleanor's menace feels surface-level rather than emerging organically from her dialogue and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure crams multiple complex concepts into tight space, with the "solution" to the throne/glove/map connection feeling rushed rather than earned through organic narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative details (shifting embroidery, oil paint scent) create immersive atmosphere, but rooftop labyrinth's potential as symbolic map remains superficially explored despite strong visual foundation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of recurring symbols (gloves/crown/orchard maze) elevates storytelling, though dialogue occasionally veers toward expositional rather than revealing subtext through character-specific diction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blends original motifs (clay locks, embroidered map) with genre tropes (unclaimed throne) in moderately fresh ways, but stilted emotional beats and occasional purple prose undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution lacks sufficient depth to fully satisfy; atmospheric elements outpace character and thematic development within constrained format.</comment>
