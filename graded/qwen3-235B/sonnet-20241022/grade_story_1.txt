<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation and fear-driven arc, but emotional depth feels surface-level despite situational plausibility. Transformation lacks incremental psychological shading.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc is coherent but compressed; garage sale trail as driving force lacks narrative weight. Pacing falters in establishing gradual knot-untangling tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory immersion in pyramid setting; atmospheric cohesion between dust, echoes, and decay masterfully evokes spiritual decay. Net's maritime origins clash tonally with Egyptian context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors crystallize theme of inner silence through physical unraveling. Subtext about trauma as literalized haunting resonates. Ending transcends sentimentality through restrained closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids formula in merging stuntman trauma with mystical quest. Some overwritten phrases ("knife-edge between sanity") verge on clich√©. Emotional progression feels earned, not just stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Inherent tension in combining Hollywood anxiety with ancient mysticism pays dividends. Pyramid's library feels contrived rather than essential. Lingering ambiguity about net's true nature rewards reflection.</comment>
