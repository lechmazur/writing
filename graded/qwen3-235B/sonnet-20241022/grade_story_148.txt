<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's desert past and fascination with storms are established but under-exploited; motivation to decode tapestry blends scientific curiosity and spiritual awakening without full psychological depth; "eagerly unwilling" dichotomy remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through decoding tapestry to restore carousel, but transitions between practical tasks and philosophical revelations feel schematic; beginning/end connection works thematically but lacks emotional payoff; pacing struggles with complex ideas in limited space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Monastery's alpine cold contrasts desert memories through sharp sensory contrasts (stone chamber drafts, snowy carousel); atmosphere effectively marries spiritual stillness with weather dynamics, though cultural specifics of Tibetan setting remain generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (dust devils/carousel motion, frayed threads/obsession) elevate; theme of renewal through preservation resonates, but emotional beats about "inner strength" feel generalized; ending achieves bittersweet closure without excessive sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps with specific details (blacksmith tongs, storm-tracking equipment), though some phrases ("turbulent spirit," "timeless rhythms") border on clich√©s; integration of technical weather knowledge and Tibetan iconography shows ingenuity, but dialogue/conceptual transitions could feel less mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Successfully woven narrative despite multiple mandatory elements, particularly carousel/tapestry connection; minor forced logic (monks' amusement, too-convenient symbolic parallels); style elevates material beyond genre requirements, but constrained word count exposes structural seams.</comment>
