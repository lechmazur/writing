<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is mostly clear but somewhat undermined by Marcus’ abrupt shifts between logical and emotional states; the smuggling backstory feels thinly developed despite surface justification through medicine deliveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot driven effectively by countdown tension, though the supernatural whispers undermine coherence; the ending ties back to the daughter but feels compressed rather than fully earned within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>St. Paul’s setting is vividly rendered through sensory details like moonlight on brass and night-blooming jasmine, but the cathedral’s historical protections feel under-integrated into the worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks strong subtext beneath redemption arc; emotional impact is diluted by predictable "secrets best left buried" trope, though the final image of the daughter connects thematically with survival-as-presence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some original details (e.g., architecture-as-lock-pattern) but relies on overused tropes (haunted ancestral artifacts, supernatural cathedral defenses); language occasionally succumbs to vague descriptors like “ghostly conversations.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The element of the daughter’s necklace anchors cohesion, but other assigned elements (like “night garden scent” method) feel forced; the story’s brevity enhances urgency but weakens thematic depth.</comment>
