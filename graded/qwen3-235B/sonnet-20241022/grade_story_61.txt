<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Queen's internal conflict is well-articulated through actions and journal, but lacks nuanced psychological complexity; motivations align with choices but remain archetypal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; pacing balances exposition and climax effectively, though the resolution feels slightly rushed despite strong causal throughline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich setting with ecological cohesion; luminous fungi/slime molds create immersive atmosphere that directly influences plot mechanics and symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (chimes as tuning forks, sacrifice as transformation) elevates thematic impact; ending lacks slight emotional urgency despite strong conceptual closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some overly-ornate phrasing ('whispers of worlds beyond imagination') borders on clich√©, but generally avoids formulaic structures; emotional subtext emerges through symbolic action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with purposeful synchronicity; compression enhances thematic focus; the fungal ecosystem's integration with cosmic stakes demonstrates inventive synergy within tight structure.</comment>
