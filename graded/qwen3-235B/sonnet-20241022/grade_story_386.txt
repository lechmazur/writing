<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to preserve her lost home through coded messages clearly drives her actions, though her inner psychology remains partially obscured by the story's poetic focus on atmosphere over introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>While the looping structure lacks traditional climax/resolution, the tight thematic throughline and consistent progression of Marina's nightly vigils create satisfying continuity within the constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>No clich√©d time-travel tropes here; the embroidered tablecloth as active navigation device and "processing line that never moves" as existential metaphor show inventive imagination.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements are meticulously woven into thematic tapestry - nothing feels imposed or arbitrary. Brevity amplifies poetic resonance rather than limiting scope.</comment>
