<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (inheriting fear/tradition) is clear and drives action, though some inner conflicts could be more nuanced. Dialogue is absent in first-person, limiting voice distinction, but actions align with agoraphobia and growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured within the limit, linking beginning/end via storm and box mechanics. Pacing balances exposition with tension; only minor rushedness in transformation scene.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting/desert atmosphere is evocative with sensory details (whispers, rain’s percussion). Object-setting connection strong, though some details (snuffbox’s hum) could deepen further.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Symbols (walls/box) effectively convey theme; ending resonates emotionally. Subtext about inherited trauma shines, though metaphors occasionally lean on familiar “liberation” tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality stands out—a magical snuffbox tied to rain rhythm feels fresh. Avoids clichés; tone remains consistent. Minor purple prose risks (e.g., “sheets of silver”), but mostly purposeful prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively—agoraphobia, snuffbox, and dunes serve the theme. Brevity enhances impact, and the ending invites reflection. Strong stylistic clarity.</comment>
