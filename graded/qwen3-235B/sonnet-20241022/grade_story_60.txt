<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's indifference to death is established through action but lacks inner conflict; motivation to seal covenant is clear yet underexplored beyond inherited duty; voice remains neutral, limiting emotional depth despite atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot driven by time-sensitive action (placing keys) creates tension; cause/effect between offering keys and chamber's response is logical but rushed; beginning/end connection is clear yet lacks resolution complexity within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (touch of stone, glowing symbols) immerse reader; setting's gothic mystique supports tone and character's purpose; interplay between cathedral's grandeur and catacombs' menace enhances thematic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evokes awe through cosmic imagery ("starfire in granite") and subverted ending; symbolism (keys as constellations, covenant as partnership) deepens theme; pacing avoids dragging but sacrifices some nuance in emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s by framing unknown as accepted rather than combated; metaphors fresh ("spaces between" existence); tone avoids formulaic melodrama; prose is purposeful but occasionally leans on familiar gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements blend cohesively into compact narrative; brevity feels intentional, emphasizing ritualistic focus; leaves thematic resonance about control vs. coexistence, though lacks experimental risk or lingering psychological complexity.</comment>
