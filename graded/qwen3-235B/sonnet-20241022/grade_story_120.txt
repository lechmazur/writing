<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Trauma-driven motivation is coherent and consistent, with the fishing lure effectively bridging past/future. Nuanced emotional growth shown through repeated actions rather than just stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Loop structure maintains narrative coherence with clear arc from desperation to acceptance. Pacing is efficient for the word limit, though the quantum tunnel's mechanics could be more explicitly connected to the philosophical resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel's metallic decay and bell tower echo create evocative atmosphere. Sensory details (raindrop, rippling light) powerfully immerse while thematically mirroring character's fractured psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Symbolism of fishing lure as both connection and loss resonates deeply. Ending achieves emotional catharsis without sentimentality, subverting sci-fi tropes by framing acceptance as victory rather than defeat.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Time-loop trope is innovatively fused with grief psychology rather than being superficially applied. Avoids "wise child" clich√© through focusing on physical details (hand-holding) over didactic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically - quantum structure enables trauma exploration, fishing lure grounds metaphysics in intimacy. Short form enhances emotional compression, leaving resonance beyond explicit resolution.</comment>
