<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a dutiful ward drives early behaviors, but emotional transformation feels underdeveloped and overly convenient. The grandfather twist adds depth but lacks preceding emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through tight cause-effect of voice note clues, but the revelation about adoption arrives with insufficient narrative weight given word constraints. Pacing remains controlled throughout.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in specific details (stone angel, ivy-covered garden) but the "soundless sanctuary" framework feels inconsistently applied between hospice and choir elements. Sensory cohesion slightly uneven.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ending delivers emotional resonance through symbolic glove removal and multilayered theme of liberation. Occasional over-reliance on direct emotional statements slightly weakens show-don't-tell effectiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through the unconventional intergenerational mystery format. Some transitional phrasing risks feeling formulaic, but the voice note narrative method demonstrates inventive character revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements converge effectively into a thematically unified narrative about inherited identity and rebellion. Tight length amplifies impact but occasionally limits secondary character depth.</comment>
