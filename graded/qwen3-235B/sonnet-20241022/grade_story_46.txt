<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conceptual but underdeveloped; her "blankness" and "uniquely typical" traits lack emotional or psychological depth, reducing her to a symbolic vessel rather than a compelling persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Static rhythm with no narrative arc; repetitive descriptions of her process create circular stagnation rather than a sense of progression or resolution within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive but overwhelming; the lush, hyper-detailed atmosphere occasionally drowns thematic subtleties, though its haunting surrealism powerfully mirrors the protagonist's role.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite craftsmanship elevates the story; layered metaphors (e.g., "celestial filters," "architecture of hearsay") and thematic resonance between music, truth, and myth create memorable literary impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original yet precise; avoids formulaic phrasing with fresh imagery (lunar eclipses as vending machine triggers) and resists genre tropes, maintaining a singular tone without excess embellishment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clever concept execution but lacks thematic urgency; elements serve the storyâ€™s aesthetics more than a cohesive, emotionally resonant whole.</comment>
