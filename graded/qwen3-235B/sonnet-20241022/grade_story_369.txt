<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is emotionally resonant but occasionally contrived; his transition from obsession to acceptance relies too heavily on plot devices rather than nuanced internal development. The spiritual journey framework feels intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is admirably compressed yet coherent, though the resolution feels overly deliberate and teleological. The connection from the initial package to the final letter is logical but sacrifices organic tension for thematic neatness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through tactile descriptions of the lighthouse and fog, creating a palpable sense of isolation. Sensory details enhance the weight of secrets but occasionally verge on over-stylized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling evokes melancholy and introspection through strong metaphorical use of puzzles and light. The message about unanswerable questions resonates, but the ending’s aphoristic quality risks sentimental oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with the puzzle-box symbolism but occasionally succumbs to mannered prose (“lethargic excitement,” “optimistically bitter”). Emotional beats sometimes lack rawness beneath the lyrical veneer.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack transcendent synergy; the lighthouse and packages ground the story, yet the final revelation feels schematic rather than startlingly human. Lingering impact is modest.</comment>
