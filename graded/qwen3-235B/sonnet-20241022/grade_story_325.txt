<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Dr. Thornberry's eccentricity overshadows nuanced development; her obsessive motivation drives the plot but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict. Her stern "comically serious" voice is consistent yet feels one-dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on the film reel's hidden content but feels compressed; the convergence point's revelation lacks emotional payoff. Pacing is uneven—exposition-heavy early beats clash with sudden supernatural climax. Cause/effect between plant behavior and plot mechanics is logically tenuous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The high-altitude tea house's creaking projector and oolong-scented shadows create palpable atmosphere. Static film disruptions and glowing plants evoke sensory wonder, though Mr. Chen's dual role detracts from the mystical tone with contrived espionage elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mixes pseudo-scientific jargon with supernatural elements to intriguing effect, but the theme of "science as mysticism" isn't fully explored. Dialogue feels stilted; ending prioritizes spectacle over meaningful resolution. Tension between empirical rigor and otherworldliness remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subverts mad scientist tropes by tying botanical obsession to multidimensional discovery, but relies on ornate descriptors ("precisely at 12,000 feet") rather than organic detail. Plant sentience borders on magical realism without sufficient narrative groundwork.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are competently interwoven—the belt's vials and film's static serve dual purposes—but some feel forced (fickle loyalty revealed abruptly). The tea house's atmospheric potential exceeds its narrative function, and the ending sacrifices cohesion for shock value.</comment>
