<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While Mira's professional drive and emotional conflict with Elena are well-established, deeper emotional motivations and character history remain underexplored. Internal monologue provides distinct voice, but character evolution within the compressed narrative feels somewhat constrained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing maintains forward momentum through bioluminescent infection as both plot device and emotional metaphor. Resolution of Elena's modifications feels slightly rushed, but tight word constraints are generally handled with effective cause-effect logic and clean arc from observation to pursuit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine details (hissing steam, brass vials, mechanical fish) create vividly immersive sensory atmosphere. The 'battered marvel' tone shines through contrasts between fragile butterflies and industrial setting, though the timeframe between treaties remains under-integrated thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotional subtext through biochemical symbolism (infection as love letter) elevates the narrative. The marriage of scientific method and romantic pursuit achieves meaningful thematic depth, with closing imagery of transformed butterflies offering satisfying synthesis of personal and conceptual conflicts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids steampunk tropes through innovative fusion with bioengineering. Emotional nuance emerges through subtext rather than exposition, with metaphors (rust/romance, glowing infection) feeling freshly contextualized. Some thematic density risks overwrought phrasing but remains grounded in specific scientific detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements into cohesive narrative that feels deliberate rather than constrained. Submarine setting and bioluminescent tracking work in concert, with final image of illuminated butterflies providing resonant closure. Slight looseness in treaty timeframe integration prevents perfect cohesion.</comment>
