<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character development lacks depth; Marcus’s transition from passive observer to pivotal actor feels abrupt and undermotivated. His jadedness is stated but not embodied—his reactions to the scalpel, time travelers, and crystalline epiphany lack psychological nuance, rendering his agency implausible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure is inventive within constraints but strains credibility. The doodles’ revelation drives momentum, yet the leap to time travelers feels unearned. The ending ties to the opening, but the “mixing drinks as temporal intervention” concept stretches plausibility without sufficient groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal lab’s fusion of scientific precision and barroom melancholy is vivid. Sensory details (amber liquids, refracted fireworks light) enhance mood. However, the lab setting’s potential for claustrophobic tension is underexploited—its sterile beauty overshadows visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Storytelling blends lyrical prose with existential stakes. The metaphor of crystallization as destiny’s precipitate is haunting. The theme of cyclical time anchors the narrative, though the ending’s quasi-mystical optimism risks undercutting subtler tensions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality falters at key junctions. Time travelers as “refugees” borrows tropes; the “scalpel-as-proof” leans on contrivance. However, the bartender protagonist and crystalline refractive symbolism are innovative. Some dialogue and descriptions (e.g., “ice crystals in solution”) verge on generic.</comment>
