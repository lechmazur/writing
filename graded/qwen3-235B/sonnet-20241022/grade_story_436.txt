<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meridian's motivation is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict; her grief and determination are surface-level despite her sorrowful role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is tight and urgent within the word limit, but the resolution feels abrupt; the Oracle's ambiguous final words leave momentum unresolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potent sensory details (heat ripples, "humming" fortress) deeply anchor the exile's desolation; tone and setting harmonize to amplify emotional and thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (tears as catalyst) and subtext about reclaiming history; ending provokes reflection but leans on understated emotional payoff rather than immersive showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes (tears as "painful joy" catalyst) but stumbles with ornate phrases ("frozen starlight") and compressed exposition that feels algorithmic in moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements are tightly woven into the narrative's logic, though the brevity occasionally strains emotional depth; conclusion lingers thematically but lacks visceral punch.</comment>
