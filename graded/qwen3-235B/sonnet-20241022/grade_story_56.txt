<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually sound but lacks nuance in transition from swindler to vulnerable truth-teller. Inner conflict remains underexplored despite compelling setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed. Setup and resolution connect thematically rather than causally; emotional payoff arrives abruptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through specific sensory details (dusty thud, amber light) that deepen both setting and thematic tension between natural and artificial.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive environmental symbolism, though "energetic lethargy" remains superficial. Sensory details feel purposeful rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story achieves conceptual cohesion despite tight parameters, but some character-driven moments feel perfunctory. Lingering thematic resonance partially compensates for narrative brevity.</comment>
