<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character development is thin beyond surface traits; motivation to preserve folk medicine is clear but not deeply psychologized. "Secretive pathfinder" role feels imposed rather than organically integrated with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on compressed backstory rather than dramatized progression. Marathon training framework provides timing but lacks cause-effect mechanics. Revolutionary network development feels abruptly resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid decayed-attraction imagery contrasts with sterile digital activism. Atmosphere falters in sensory underdevelopment (e.g., herbal smells, teapot texture) and forced "comfort" in grotesque setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The cracked teapot as metaphor works, but emotional impact diluted by excessive exposition. Themes of cultural erasure resonate, though character-story balance leans too heavily toward concept demonstration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual tech-analog synthesis. Some purple prose in emotional descriptions ("burning anger at loss"), but overall shows ingenuity in playlist encryption as narrative device.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic checklist rather than organically woven components. The premise intrigues but remains underexplored within the constrained space, lacking narrative density.</comment>
