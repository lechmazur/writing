<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Maya's mutism shapes her communication through Sebastian, but her motivation to cross universes remains underexplored. While her quiet determination aligns with her traits, emotional depth in her decision to reunite with her mother feels surface-level despite the haunting context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The meteorological bridge between worlds drives the plot efficiently, but the three-year anniversary coincidence strains plausibility. Pacing is tight, yet the diner's role as a narrative anchor could be more integrated with the interdimensional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The three moons and prismatic tides create vivid visuals, but sensory details about the diner's atmosphere or Venice Beach's altered ecosystem are sparse. The interplay between climate and emotion feels underdeveloped despite strong conceptual imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The puppet acts as a compelling narrative device, but the resolution's emotional payoff lacks subtext. The weather journal symbolizes connection, yet deeper exploration of mutism as metaphor for displacement would elevate the thematic weight of "redefining family."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Diluted selectivity mutism stereotypes with interdimensional climate science feels fresh, but tonal shifts between ethereal tides and mundane diner routine occasionally clash. The cardboard sleeve moment strains as intentional symbolism rather than organic detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hybrid high-concept/character-driven approach mostly coheses, though some assigned elements distract. The ending avoids trite reunions but leaves underlying familial tensions unexamined, compromising its lingering resonance.</comment>
