<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s curse drives key action but lacks layered psychological depth; transformation feels abrupt and insufficiently earned through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear arc and symbolic structure present but pacing strains credibility; moon phases as a resolution mechanism require excessive narrative leeway.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, atmospheric decay in setting; birds as living contrast to petrification adds textural richness; tone-work with sensory details excels.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés (petrification as growth) but occasionally wavers into ornate abstraction; tapestry imagery risks over-explanation, diluting mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Concept-driven cohesion exists but prioritizes thematic density over organic character progression; lingering idea of layered truth is potent.</comment>
