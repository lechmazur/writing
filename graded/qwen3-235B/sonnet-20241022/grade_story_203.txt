<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's stage fright and ancestral duty are conceptually linked, but internal contradictions (fear vs. defiant resolve) remain underexplored; motivations shift too cleanly without nuanced emotional friction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Predictable rising action culminates in a cosmic ritual, but the abrupt convergence of elements (quantum entanglement, toy rocket) sacrifices logical cause-effect chains for poetic resolution within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visionary atmosphere merges cosmic horror with domestic intimacy through tactile details (glowing petals, click of a music box), though orbital debris setting remains more symbolic than physically grounded.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (souls as orbital debris, lullabies as quantum mechanics) create cerebral/visceral resonance; ending transcends genre tropes but risks becoming precious abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Subverts exorcism tropes with quantum mysticism, but relies on familiar "secret family legacy" scaffolding; sensory details occasionally over-adorn rather than reveal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a singular speculative vision where form and theme merge, though some assigned components (e.g., "never usual") feel conceptually strained rather than organically essential.</comment>
