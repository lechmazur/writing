<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to help ghosts let go is clear, but his internal conflict and backstory remain underexplored. The "elegantly clumsy" attribute shapes his interactions but lacks deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot progression through repair work and ghostly observations feels organic. The tightly contained arc (repair begins/ends with elevator work, emotional resolution via the flower crown) succeeds within constraints, though the conflict's simplicity risks feeling underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through specific details (humidity systems, echoing whispers, translucent sand manipulation). The sand castle lab's surreal juxtaposition of scientific rigor and spectral melancholy creates visceral immersion. The "dissonance of silence" during midday is especially potent sensory writing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ending delivers emotional resonance through understated symbolism (the crown as bridge between worlds). Subtext about impermanence vs. preservation is woven effectively, though dialogue occasionally leans into aphoristic tone at the expense of raw vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Concept of ghosts fixated on sand castles avoids clich√© by tying to precise setting details. Some phrases ("whispers echoing through the shaft") border on formulaic, but the core premise of repair technician-meets-ghost-whisperer maintains originality. Emotional stakes feel earned rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements cohere into thematic unity about holding/letting go. The brevity serves as a strength through metaphorical compression. Lingering questions about Marcus's past hint at greater depths without marring the whole.</comment>
