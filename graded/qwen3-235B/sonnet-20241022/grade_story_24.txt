<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (father's remorse influencing performance) but internal conflict lacks layered emotional complexity; reactions to the daughter's text remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc, but the connection between the puppet show's impact and daughter's response relies on metaphorical abstraction rather than concrete cause-effect; pacing drags in atmospheric descriptions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (lethal stalactites, glowing puppets) create immersive atmosphere; some descriptions verge on ornate without deepening thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (warmth as emotional connection, fragmented tales as reconciliation) resonate; subtext about storytelling's redemptive power is nuanced and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fresh imagery (sourdough ghosts, warmth-collecting child); minor overuse of adjectives in atmospheric passages prevents perfect "showing" over "telling."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively interwoven; brevity serves thematic focus but slightly weakens emotional payoff of the father-daughter resolution.</comment>
