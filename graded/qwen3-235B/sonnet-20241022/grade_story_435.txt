<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Poorly developed character beyond surface traits. Motivations lack psychological depth. Little insight into what shapes Elena's personality beyond convenient plot device of recurring dreams. Sudden transformation into "dream liberator" feels unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot has clear trajectory but feels rushed and underdeveloped. Synchronicity of events strains believability. Important turning points occur off-stage or are barely shown. Connections between beginning and end lack narrative weight. Pacing uneven between slow baking details and sudden transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting has intriguing concepts but lacks sensory specificity. "Vapor collection facility" described in vague, abstract terms. Atmosphere tries to create mystery but relies on clich√©d descriptors ("whispers of forgotten possibilities"). Moods shift abruptly without foundation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story attempts thematic depth about freedom vs control but execution feels superficial. Some effective imagery with burning sourdough symbolism, but lacks narrative tension. Ending intended to provoke thought but lacks emotional resonance. Relies on stating ideas rather than showing their impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Feels formulaic in its concept and execution. Relies on familiar rebellion-against-system tropes without fresh subversion. Expository prose replaces nuanced characterization. Metaphors ("calcifying laws") feel conceptually interesting but narratively underdeveloped. Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction without purpose.</comment>
