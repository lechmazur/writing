<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's calm doomsayer trait is present but underexplored; motivation for slamming the door on the gods lacks visceral depth despite effective symbolic use of objects.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as a static ritual rather than progression; train whistle and prophecy recitation drive minimal action, but cohesive closure is implied through cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk workshop and sunrise timeframe intertwine masterfully; sensory details (hissing steam, faded stickers) immerse readers in the melancholic, ticking world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evokes contemplation of mortality through mechanical metaphors; lacks overt conflict but conveys thematic tension between stasis and revolution; ending resonates as existential acceptance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s despite steampunk familiarity; metaphors feel fresh (gears as mortality markers); some abstract phrases risk poetic detachment but generally serve tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements merge seamlessly (mechanical menagerie aligns with doomsaying); slight tension between vignette brevity and thematic ambition, but lingering unease about acceptance vs. resignation elevates impact.</comment>
