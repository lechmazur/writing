<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Madame Rosa's sarcastic panic is distinct, but her motivation as a soothsayer lacks depth; her actions feel more situationally reactive than rooted in a fully realized internal life.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Promising setup and resolution, but pacing falters in the middle; the transition to planting the seed feels abrupt despite the story's existential stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Neon-lit desert and billboards create oppressive splendor; sensory details like humming signs and sticky bar tops immerse readers, though "lost years" remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seed-as-metaphor elevates the theme; dialogue crackles with subtext, but emotional resonance stays surface-level despite strong symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but uneven in execution; the desert setting and seed reveal are masterstrokes, while the "lost years" and corporate symbolism feel half-realized.</comment>
