<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; internal conflict is hinted at but not fully explored, making transformation feel somewhat rushed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing is uneven; the sudden shift to becoming the doll could use more gradual buildup within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive, though the planetarium's connection to the circus setting feels tenuously justified through thematic resonance alone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</comment>Uses symbolism (mirrors, light) effectively but occasionally veers toward explicit emotional telling rather than showing; theme of sacrifice is strong.</grade>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic transitions and predictable resolutions; the doll's transformation subverts expectations without feeling contrived or overly ornate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong cohesion among elements with deliberate stylistic choices; the ending lingers thematically while honoring the story's brevity as a strength.</comment>
