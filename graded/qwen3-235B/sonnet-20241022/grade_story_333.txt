<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's rebellious streak and preservationist drive are clear, but her internal conflict between defiance and understanding lacks nuanced development, and the ghost's shifting motivations confuse its character arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but hurried—transforming the sticky note into a partnership feels abrupt, and the storm-driven timeframe doesn't fully integrate with the resolution, leaving the ending slightly disconnected.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with creeping shadows, thunder, and cold spots, effectively immersing readers in the manor's haunted history, though some Gothic tropes verge on overused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story uses symbolism (sticky note, shifting architecture) to explore themes of preservation and rebellion, with lyrical prose and subtextual parallels between Maya and the ghost, though some emotional beats lean on explicit dialogue rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with creative twists (ghost as ally, "together" finale), but relies partially on haunted-house clichés and occasionally overdescriptive passages that border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive and purposeful, blending assigned elements into a resonant narrative about preservation as rebellion, though the word limit strains deeper exploration of Maya's internal and external conflicts.</comment>
