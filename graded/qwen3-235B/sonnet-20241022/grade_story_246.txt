<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity beyond surface traits; consistent motivation but minimal emotional depth or flawed nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot coherent with clear arc but feels rushed in key transitions (e.g., from discovery to ritual); cause-effect relationships require narrative shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (dancing compasses, crystallized deaths) create haunting atmosphere that elevates setting to character status.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose contains striking metaphors ("whispers from hankerchief") and thematic weight about legacy sacrifice, though some emotional beats lean too heavily on exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Originality in crystalline curse/ley-lines fusion avoids genre tropes; no significant AI-adjacent prose flaws though rhythm occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements work in tandem but lack transcendent synergy; ending resonates conceptually without achieving literary memorability.</comment>
