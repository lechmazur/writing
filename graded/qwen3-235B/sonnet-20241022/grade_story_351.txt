<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but thinly developed; Marcus' rebelliousness informs his actions but inner conflict lacks depth. His poetic voice is stylistically consistent but personal stakes remain vague in critical moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows riddle-driven progression effectively, but temporal logic bends abruptly in climax. Episodic structure maintains coherence within constraints, though the final transition feels rushed despite strong bookend symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is richly realized through precise decay imagery and atmospheric contrasts between ivy's softness and industrial ruin. Sensory details (humming sundial, parting ivy) enhance spatial tension but occasionally verge on overwrought description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (time as undulating force, memory as resurrection) resonate strongly. The ending's emotional weight lingers but relies partly on nostalgic tropes rather than transcendent originality. Subtext about artistic responsibility is clear but subtly handled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clich√©s through tactile details (shifting wax patterns; suitcased ghosts) but occasionally defaults to atmospheric conventions (whispering townsfolk, ivy-as-mourning). Language balances lyricism with clarity without fully succumbing to purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as narrative skeleton rather than organic components; several (raven, sundial) feel indispensable while others (formal rebelliousness) remain underutilized. The ending's lingering metaphysical questions elevate its impact beyond surface plot.</comment>
