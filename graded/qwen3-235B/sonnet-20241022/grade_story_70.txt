<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character shows clear arc of transformation through internal conflict, but some emotional shifts feel condensed within brevity constraints. Motivation for obsession with order connects to mother's disappearance, though deeper psychological underpinnings remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows logical cause-effect through adhesive analysis revelation, but rapid transition to mother's mystical backstory strains coherence. Pacing compresses necessary emotional beats, though resolution ties to initial mystery effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive sensory worldbuilding merges gothic and steampunk elements. Greenhouse-gravesite juxtaposition creates haunting atmosphere; Tesla bulb's ethereal effects integrate beautifully with both setting and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (cocoon, heartbeat-bulb sync) deepen thematic resonance. Ending avoids melodrama, showing transformation through nuanced physical reactions (tears nurturing plants). Subtext about embracing duality feels elegantly executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of steampunk science/magic avoids genre tropes. Avoids over-explanation through implication rather than exposition. Some phrase choices ("gravestones whisper secrets") approach edge of clich√© but gain freshness through contextual reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story transcends "assignment" structure through thematic unity. Word limit enhances focus on pivotal moment. Leaves lingering questions about legacy vs. self-determination while resolving core character mystery.</comment>
