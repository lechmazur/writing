<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maya's linguistic ineptitude and dancer identity are established but underexplored; her shift from denial to acceptance feels rushed, with generational dance language lacking depth. Internal conflict is present but needs more nuance to fully realize her motivations and sharp-wittedness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from bath to realization, but the chamber transformation and prophecy resolution are abrupt. The concept shapes the arc, but cause-effect between the patch and quantum entanglement could be tighter. Pacing balances mystery and revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Steam, iridescent chamber, and celestial photos create vivid atmosphere. Sensory details (patch scratches, condensation) immerse readers, though the experiment chamber’s abrupt appearance undercuts cohesion. Tone balances grief and scientific wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (dance as entanglement, prophecy twist) evoke layered meaning. Ending’s theme of "ambivalence between movement/stillness" resonates, though emotional depth could use more showing than telling. Subtextual connections to legacy elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegantly subverts prophecy tropes by focusing on non-verbal communication. Avoids clichés; metaphors/similes are fresh (e.g., "mirror fractured into infinite selves"). No formulaic phrases; language is purposeful yet poetic, balancing logic and emotion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements cohere thematically, though the thought experiment chamber and photos feel underutilized. The twist on prophecy through muscle memory is inventive. Leaves a lingering meditation on language vs. embodiment, but tighter integration of settings could enhance cohesion.</comment>
