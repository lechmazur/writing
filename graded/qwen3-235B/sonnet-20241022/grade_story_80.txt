<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation (solving a family riddle) is clear but lacks psychological depth; her "daring" nature is shown through action, not internal conflict. The doorknob interaction reveals determination but not inner complexity. Trait consistency is maintained but feels superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear path with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing stumbles under word constraints. The doorknob's function drives progression, yet the transition from logs to coaster feels rushed. Cause-effect ties to "eroded reality" concept, but coherence strains in compressed form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends decay (rusted tracks) and mysticism (glowing symbols) effectively, though sensory details are uneven—e.g., the "sound of coaster wheels" mentioned but not sonically rendered. Setting enriches the eerie tone but lacks immersive depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ending delivers a thematic gut-punch by redefining the riddle as a participatory act rather than intellectual exercise. Imagery of starlight tracks is vivid, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized. Subtext about obsession borders on cliché without deeper character grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Concept avoids pure trope recycling (roller coasters as interdimensional guides) but struggles with originality in supporting elements (haunted inns, riddle clichés). Prose is tight but occasionally defaults to generic phrasing ("peculiar combination" of traits) rather than distinct stylistic choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story coheres as a myth fragment but leans too heavily on atmospheric vagueness. Assigned elements are serviceable but some (housekeeping logs) feel checklist-driven. Leaves conceptual intrigue but lacks lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
