<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Showcases functional character traits but lacks emotional depth; Maya's humility and role as scout are surface-level, motivations remain underexplored through interiority or interpersonal stakes</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Structured progression but feels rushed; discovery arc in lab lacks tension/resolution; connection between sleepwalking and spiritual mapping needs tighter integration to avoid episodic quality</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly rendered atmosphere via specific sensory details (glow patterns, moss textures, subterranean acoustics); setting becomes active character through precise, immersive descriptions</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Skillful use of metaphor (mirrors as metaphysical cartography) but lacks thematic subtext; ending prioritizes functionality over emotional resonance; prose remains polished but emotionally distant</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through specific inventions (bottled bioluminescence as research method, fractal mirror chamber); avoids purple prose but maintains consistent tone; emotional restraint occasionally veers into affectlessness</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exquisite craftsmanship unifies disparate elements; length feels intentional but sacrifices deeper thematic exploration; atmospheric density compensates somewhat for limited character/philosophical development</comment>
