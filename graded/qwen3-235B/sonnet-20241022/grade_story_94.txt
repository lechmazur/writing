<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks behavioral nuance; internal conflict is implied rather than deeply dramatized through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained but relies heavily on abstract exposition; the temporal paradox arc resolves too abruptly for complete satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting works as visual anchor (pool reflecting time scars) but lacks tactile/spatial specificity despite strong atmospheric metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery (falling earrings echoing across timelines) delivers impact, but emotional stakes remain intellectually rather than viscerally conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains traces of sci-fi tropes (time paradoxes); symbolism works yet occasionally skews precious. Prose is purposeful but occasionally overly stylized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of required elements is admirable; sacrifices some depth for thematic breadth in the constrained format.</comment>
