<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation aligns with actions, but internal conflict lacks depth; past remorse is more told than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end within constraints, but pacing feels slightly rushed in emotional beats; concept shapes structure but resolution could be tighter.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses sensory details effectively, but setting integration feels symbolic rather than organic to character psychology or plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (electricity, transformation) elevate theme; ending provides thematic cohesion, but emotional resonance remains surface-level rather than deeply immersive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with unique setting, but character reasoning occasionally leans on logical deductions without messy realism; some purple prose in descriptive passages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into functional narrative, but thematic cohesion falters in places; length feels limiting rather than purposeful in exploring character complexity.</comment>
