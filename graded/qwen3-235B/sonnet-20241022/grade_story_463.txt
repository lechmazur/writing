<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and clear motivation, but lacks emotional depth and growth beyond initial presentation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean narrative arc confined to single pivotal night; dance-driven containment/release mechanic is logical within lore, but pacing leans overly reliant on exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere through precise details (salt air, creaking floors) but underexploits sensory potential; setting-as-character remains only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Compelling metaphorical layering (dance as liberation, fraying rope as failed oaths); ending resonates with tragic nobility despite efficient plot-focused structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through counterintuitive dance-spirituality fusion; prose occasionally drifts toward ornate description but maintains stylistic cohesion and emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements achieves thematic resonance; brevity enhances ritualistic tone but slightly limits emotional payoff depth.</comment>
