<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear motivation (escape) but lacks psychological depth; coded messages hint at complexity but are underserved by underdeveloped interiority and mechanical plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression toward disappearance feels inevitable but sacrifices tension; key transitions between artistic creation and portal activation lack organic escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere of isolation and latent magic created through precise light/dust descriptions, but crater base setting remains superficially utilized beyond being a generic prison metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (dust as coded portals) elevate theme of hidden transcendence; some sentimentality in grandmother exposition weakens emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original portal mechanics and coded art avoid genre tropes; slightly derivative elements ("dust motes" as transcendence device) and occasional over-ornamentation ("weaving conspiracy") suggest limited subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Successfully combines assigned elements into cohesive whole but prioritizes concept over character; lingering impression stems more from imaginative premise than narrative substance.</comment>
