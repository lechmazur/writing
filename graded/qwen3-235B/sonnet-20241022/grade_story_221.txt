<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's emotional conflict is clear but motivations occasionally feel condensed, though the pendant and ghostly interaction effectively reveal deeper layers of grief and identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc compressed into tight word count; the pull toward the shooting gallery and resolution via the letter rewrite maintain coherence, though some transitions (e.g., sudden laughter with ghost) feel slightly underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (moonlight through broken roof, amber's glow, tin ducks) and the ghostly carnival setting create a haunting yet nostalgic atmosphere that profoundly enriches the protagonist's internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (trapped mosquito as frozen grief, thawing as release through tradition) and layered structure (story framed by letter) create emotional resonance; ending subverts expected redemption trope by reimagining rather than abandoning legacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tropes but leans slightly on "melancholy ghost" and "magical family heirloom" clich√©s; sensory details and the amber metaphor demonstrate originality, while emotional beats occasionally verge on sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate seamlessly into a cohesive whole; the letter frame and amber symbolism provide structural ingenuity, though the brevity occasionally compresses emotional evolution more than enhances it.</comment>
