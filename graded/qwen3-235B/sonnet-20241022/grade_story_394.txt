<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but underdeveloped; internal conflict and emotional depth lack nuance despite symbolic connections to the bent fork and grandmother's legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is clear but occasionally rushed; some cause-effect logic (e.g., immediate deciphering of cryptic diagrams) strains credibility within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setting uses vivid imagery (moonlight, luminescent moss) but underutilizes the amusement park's potential for richer atmospheric contrasts between decay and renewal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (e.g., airplane's flight mirroring journey); ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact could deepen through more "showing" via character reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally relies on familiar mythic structures; imagery like "liquid moonlight" borders on conventionality despite fresh worldbuilding elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and thematic, with some narrative shortcuts; the concise format works well but leaves room for expansion in character and mythos development.</comment>
