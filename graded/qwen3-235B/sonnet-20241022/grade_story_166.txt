<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lack of backstory weakens motivation consistency; the "solemnly silly" duality creates friction but lacks deeper psychological exploration; the plastic straw as a tool feels arbitrary despite its importance. The ghost's transparent form aligns with his spectral nature but insufficiently informs his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; perforation act drives plot but lacks escalation; cause-effect between wish granting and timing feels underdeveloped. Forbidden logs establish motivation but disappear after introduction. Pacing drags slightly during ritual description while geothermal steam connection to resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional fusion of contradictory elements (steam/cold, ethereal/material); sensory details like "cotton candy in rain" and "geothermal mist" create tactile immediacy. The apple trees' whispering integrates setting with thematic purpose. Auroral lighting juxtaposes with underground heat to reinforce liminality central to the concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("thoughts like wind chimes") but lacks layered subtext; ending delivers thematic resonance about belief but strains toward profundity. The conflict between ghostly existence and communication desire remains surface-level despite atmospheric richness. Writing style alternates between lyrical and preciously whimsical.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through conceptual juxtapositions (plastic straw magic) but contains some generic descriptors ("delicate holes," "gentle chaos"). The "forbidden expedition logs" border on trope territory. Emotional resonance depends more on imagery than human nuance; dialogue absent but would test authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements integrated cohesively despite artificial constraints; length enhances mythic quality but limits emotional weight. Creative combination of geothermal magic with spectral existence shows ingenuity. Lingering question about the wish-granting's cost creates thematic resonance that outlasts immediate narrative.</comment>
