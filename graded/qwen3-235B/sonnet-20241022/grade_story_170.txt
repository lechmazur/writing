<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's academically artistic trait is well-integrated, but first-person voice lacks distinctiveness. Motivation to overcome shame is consistent, though emotional shifts could be more nuanced. Connection between herbalist identity and ecological work feels underexplored despite clear throughline.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to transformation, with coral restoration as effective structural anchor. Pacing is efficient but occasionally rushed in depicting intellectual evolution. The stone's significance bookending creates satisfying circularity, though thematic payoff for "memorize" feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Radiant marine imagery (coral textures, seaweed gardens) creates immersive atmosphere. The abandoned wall's "hollow echoes" conceptually bridges setting and emotional state. Sensory details consistently serve dual purpose of world-building and psychological insight, particularly in tactile descriptions of letters and restoration work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (shame becoming symphony, coral/geometry parallels) are elegant but occasionally risk abstraction. The theme of bridging art/science through lived experience has philosophical weight. Subtle showing of transformation through changed interactions with physical environment (touching stonework at beginning/end) particularly effective.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative avoids genre clich√©s through specific marine context and intellectual rigor. Some phrasing ("breathless wonder of discovery") flirts with romanticism, but generally balanced by concrete scientific details. Emotional progression feels organic despite brief span, achieved through cumulative sensory impressions rather than explication.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Surprisingly cohesive synthesis of disparate elements that deepen rather than distract. The compression works as thematic device mirroring coral's organic growth patterns. Lingering questions about the original letter-writer's identity suggest narrative richness without compromising closure. Voice occasionally wavers between poetic and clinical.</comment>
