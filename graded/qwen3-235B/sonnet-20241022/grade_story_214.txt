<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s role as a "trapper" is only cursorily tied to his actions (solar wind trapping), and his grief-driven motivation lacks nuanced emotional complexity despite being consistent. His personality remains static, with inner life implied more through actions than distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of discovery, but the leap from decoding glass to manipulating a black hole feels underexplored. Pacing balances setup and climax well within constraints, though cause-effect for the resolution leans on contrived convenience.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The methane sea observatory offers intriguing visuals but underused sensory texture—e.g., scant sound/smell details. The "pulsing black hole" and glowing sea glass create a dissonant blend of gritty and whimsical tones that don’t fully cohere atmospherically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (e.g., "harvested light filling empty spaces") elevate the theme, but emotional beats lean on stated sentiments ("filled with legacy of light") rather than subtext. The ending satisfies thematically but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combines sci-fi and personal legacy tropes without subverting them. Phrases like "whimsical thought" and "celebrating the discovery" verge on cliché, while the "black hole of doubt" metaphor feels forced. Lacks linguistic or structural innovation to transcend genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story is competently constructed around its elements but unevenly integrates them—e.g., the "floating observatory" and "between shifts" framework feel underexploited. The theme of loss-to-legacy resonates, but execution lacks the daring needed for prestigious publication.</comment>
