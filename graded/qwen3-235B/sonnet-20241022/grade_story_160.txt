<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blends genre tropes (airship mysteries) with quantum mysticism effectively, but phrases like "analytically free mind" risk pretentious abstraction; braille-briefcase decoding shows ingenuity while avoiding clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but occasionally mechanically; brevity works for mystery but hinders emotional investment. Lingering questions about reality's architecture outweigh character engagement.</comment>
