<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters are moderately developed with clear motivations, but secondary characters (Sarah/Emma) lack nuance despite Marcus's emotionally grounded pursuit of redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tight plot structure connects beginning (obsession/research) to end (reunion), but the parole hearing subplot weakens coherence and feels underexploited within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with immersive sensory details (e.g., "crystallized tears/sapphires") effectively enhances the magical realism and melancholic tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (microscope as hope) and subtext (belief vs. proof) elevate the narrative, though the resolution's sentimentalism slightly dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes with original details (e.g., "steamwork + starlight" circus), natural dialogue, and a nuanced balance of logical pursuit and human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively (drive-in as reunion site, microscope as proof), though the parole angle feels peripheral. The story lingers thematically on redemption and belief.</comment>
