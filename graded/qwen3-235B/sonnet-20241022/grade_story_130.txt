<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s internal conflict between duty and self-discovery is hinted at but underdeveloped; her transformation feels passive, reliant on cosmic revelations rather than active choices or nuanced introspection. The "privately open" attribute shapes her silence but lacks emotional depth beyond surface gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The discovery of the nest and subsequent removal drive the plot, but the phone’s transmissions are underutilized as a structural device. Pacing is uneven: the drift toward acceptance is well-managed, but the captain’s abrupt order disrupts cohesion without sufficient setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The interstellar orchard ship is vividly rendered with sensory details (bioluminescent nebulae, rustling leaves in artificial wind), creating a hauntingly lyrical atmosphere. However, the setting’s sci-fi logic (e.g., gravity-defying trees) is inconsistently explored, leaving gaps in immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like the nest and static-as-wisdom resonate thematically, but the ending leans on exposition (“freedom wasn’t about fixed points”) rather than earned subtext. The core conflict—Maya’s self-acceptance—is clear but occasionally told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cosmic nesting of dark matter eggs and phone-static wisdom are original, but the “mocking affection” tone feels underexplored. Some phrasing (“beautiful terror of being lost”) veers toward cliché. Emotional beats are intuitive but occasionally flattened by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story’s ambition—the fusion of cosmic scale and intimate growth—is admirable, but its execution is uneven. The orchard-root-phone integration is elegant, yet the tight word limit exposes structural seams, particularly in the captain’s sudden intrusion and Maya’s swift resolution.</comment>
