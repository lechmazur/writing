<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character traits like "forthright" and "meekly assertive" lack depth; motivations are clear but feel simplified without psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc within constraints, though the revelation about independent protocols feels underdeveloped despite driving the resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned station atmosphere is evocative, but sensory details (e.g., dust, humming) lack variety; tone of "joyful loneliness" inconsistently sustained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., cosmic rhythm, blooming hope) enhance emotional resonance; ending effectively synthesizes theme, though subtext occasionally overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrases ("universe’s eternal song") border on cliché; combines tropes (abandoned space stations, oaths) with moderate ingenuity but avoids full formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but lack electrifying synergy; brief length feels limiting rather than intentional, with ideas underexplored (e.g., sister’s legacy).</comment>
