<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations and emotional stakes remain largely unexamined beyond surface-level wonder. Serene's grudging admiration lacks nuance or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed; pivotal moments of revelation lack narrative breathing room to fully resonate within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (glass refractions, extinct flora, tactile threads) create an immersive, mythic atmosphere that deeply intersects with thematic focus on duality and paradox.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Relies on mystical-relic tropes; moments of overwrought phrasing ("tapestry of impossible knowledge") and underdeveloped emotional subtext suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Solid conceptual cohesion with lingering thematic resonance, but constrained length highlights uneven character engagement and occasional narrative abstraction.</comment>
