<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya's detachment is evident but cursorily explored; her abrupt emotional shift risks feeling contrived. While the stones and message connect to her growth, motivations are stated more than psychologically earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Structural progression from discovery to resolution is clear but hurried. The gravitational anomaly lacks narrative payoff beyond metaphorical resonance, creating episodic rather than causal momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered (floating boxes, humming tension) but the anomaly feels under-justified as a physical or thematic element, diluting its immersive potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong poetic imagery and resonant metaphors (stones/rivers/courage) elevate the work, though emotional catharsis occasionally veers toward clich√© rather than earned epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Metaphors about adaptation are familiar rather than subversive; the gravitational anomaly and constellation motif border on poetic abstraction rather than organic storytelling, with moments of overwrought phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive thematically but uneven in execution. Assigned elements often feel like accoutrements rather than narrative necessities, though the central metaphor provides conceptual unity.</comment>
