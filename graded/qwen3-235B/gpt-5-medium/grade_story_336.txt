<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's traits are conceptually present but lack psychological depth; motivation is poetic but abstract rather than emotionally compelling. The first-person narration has voice but little interiority or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lack of concrete conflict minimizes forward momentum; plot resolves through symbolic gestures rather than narrative progression. Coherence exists through tone, not causal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered — sensory details like 'fluorescents and tile stars' create haunting fusion of decay and cosmic grandeur. Setting dominates over character and plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric density elevates the prose; grief as architecture, time as carceral system. The ending's "gentler ferocity" synthesizes theme with linguistic precision. Occasionally sacrifices narrative clarity for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre archetypes through mythopoeic language. Some phrases like 'mercy along tiles' risk becoming aestheticized. Emotional subtext resonates through implication rather than statement. Originality derives from idiosyncratic imagery rather than plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Each element is conceptually integral but unevenly realized — worldbuilding outpaces character development. The compressed form works but risks fragmentary engagement. Memorable for its poetic vision.</comment>
