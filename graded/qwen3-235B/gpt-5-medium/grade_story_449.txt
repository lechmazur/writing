<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character exists more as symbolic vessel than fully realized entity; motivations are conceptually clear but lack emotional depth. "Awkwardness" manifests through poetic actions but doesn't evolve through conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows baking-as-philosophy arc but relies on poetic abstraction over cause-effect logic. Structure feels circular rather than progressive; "fusion" climax lacks concrete resolution within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imaginative merging of cosmic and domestic spheres creates immersive atmosphere. Time dilation setting manifests through vivid sensory contrasts (century vs. seconds), though integration with plot remains partial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exceptional density of metaphor and thematic resonance. Language choices create haunting emotional undercurrents; theme of paradoxical truth-through-culinary-ritual emerges powerfully despite minimal plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality evident but borders on self-indulgent abstraction. Some phrases risk becoming flowery ("crystalline hush"), but emotional subtext (hunger/fear healing) redeems through human universality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Story coheres through obsessive metaphorical consistency despite packed elements. Style serves theme intentionally, though brevity strains narrative completeness - ends conceptually rather than structurally fulfilled.</grade>
