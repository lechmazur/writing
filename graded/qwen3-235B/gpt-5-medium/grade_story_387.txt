<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength lies in the selfless musician’s singular focus as a listening steward, with actions like bloodied sacrifice for wind chimes directly tied to their ethos. Weakness stems from minimal emotional interiority; depth relies more on poetic abstraction than human-scale psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Taut structure balances micro-event (starwhale encounter) with macro-history (centuries of legacy). Clear arc of crisis-prevention via sound, but the "mapping" goal remains more conceptual than dramatically demonstrated within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ornate, tactile worldbuilding with clashing textures (salvaged hulls, bleeding hands, vinyl static) creates immersive synesthetic logic. Atmosphere *is* the narrative engine—every detail resonates with themes of fragile trust and resonant survival.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Transcendent use of metaphor (e.g., cartography as pressure-sensitive pauses) and symbolic objects deepens philosophical weight. Ending avoids cliché closure by implying ongoing struggle, not final victory, for interspecies ethics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistently inventive: wind-chime coordinates, "serration lullaby," and choral fuel trading avoid sci-fi tropes. Occasional phrase density ("salvaged hope," "flicker on brow") risks abstraction, but most imagery feels freshly minted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Marries all elements into a mythic parable where form and theme are inseparable. Each plot beat and symbol interlocks with others to ask: what does it mean to encounter the Other without imprint of violence?</comment>
