<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Implied emotional nuance, but lacks deep exploration of the reaper's internal conflict. Motivation and character history feel partially told rather than organically revealed through actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from mapping impulse to resolution, but relies on abstract connections (seeds, rivers) to imply structure rather than dramatizing causal logic. Pacing feels intentionally slow rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lush atmospheric details create immersion, but several assigned setting elements (e.g., "forgotten library") function more as poetic symbols than integrated environments that actively shape plot or character psychology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric density sustains thematic unity (evolving relationships/circulation) while the image of "drinkable light" as metaphor for healing resonates beyond the page. Ending lacks gut-punch emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Highly original conceptual layering (mapping grief as hydrant for the living/dead) avoids formulaic writing, though occasionally sacrifices emotional immediacy for lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive through poetic logic, but some elements (seeds as cartographic tools) feel more like conceptual scaffolding than organic narrative drivers. Lingering questions about evolving relationships lack sharp thematic resolution.</comment>
