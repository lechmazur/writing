<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Poetic abstraction undercuts character depth; motivation and internal conflict hinted at but not fully realized. The voice is distinct but filtered through self-conscious metaphor rather than raw psychological textures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows with eerie logic but falters in temporal compression - the transition from receipt discovery to collective remembrance feels rushed despite lyrical precision in framing scenes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory layering creates immersive decay: the olfactory fusion of iron/oranges, tactile creases in receipts, silence-as-audiophile-phantom. Spatial duality (barracks/ballroom) deepens thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Receipt-as-scoresheet metaphor and grief-as-buffered-signal concept demonstrate profound poetic logic. The metronome ending crystallizes the tension between mourning and memory. Flaws: occasional emotional distance from characters' stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strains formal innovation with near-overdetermined symbolism but redeems itself through originality of framework. Avoids clich√© in combining modern exorcism with analog hauntings, though some phrases risk ornamental excess without narrative heft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements function as alchemical catalysts rather than checklist items, with the haunting emerging organically from digital/physical intersections. The brevity contains multitudes but sacrifices emotional payoff in favor of metaphysical schematics.</comment>
