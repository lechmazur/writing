<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Characterization is atmospheric and abstract rather than deeply formed; motivations are stated but not psychologically grounded. The "eager lookout" identity remains more symbolic than humanized, and actions align loosely with stated goals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional structure—progression relies on associative imagery rather than cause-effect. The cyclical emphasis on "cleaning" and "connection" provides fragmentary coherence, but tension/resolution remain diffuse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stellar sensory immersion in blending antiquity and near-future tech. The limewashed walls with circuitry, cypresswood scent, and conductive vines create a tactile, haunting atmosphere that deepens the story’s themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., stitching time, dust spelling "coniunge") and layered subtext. The ending resonates thematically without sentimentality, and the "translation" of repairs into narrative offers emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution; avoids easy tropes. While some phrases (e.g., "staccato cold spots") verge on overwriting, most imagery feels freshly imagined. Emotions are conveyed through gesture and setting, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically within the story’s lyrical logic. The brevity feels intentional, rewarding engagement with its ambiguity. The central metaphor of connection-as-repair lingers beyond the page.</comment>
