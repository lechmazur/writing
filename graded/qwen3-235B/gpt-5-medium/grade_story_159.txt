<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character voice lacks depth; motivations (solving labyrinth) feel abstract without emotional stakes; reactions to kaleidoscope/betrayal lack human nuance; "earnestly frivolous" trait inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rushed arc; labyrinth's "solve" through confetti-coded proposals strains internal logic; causal links between betrayal and transformation feel poetic but underdeveloped; middle collapses; ending's thematic cohesion exists but lacks earned payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Labyrinth feels viscerally immersive through rich visual metaphor; floating lanterns create haunting atmosphere; underused non-visual senses (sound/touch) limit full immersion; tone balances mysticism with grounded melancholy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("crowns of absence") resonate; labyrinth-as-symbol sustains thematic weight; ending generates reflective tension; excessive ornateness sometimes obscures emotional truth; shows vs. tells unevenly balanced but effectively haunting overall.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids flat clich√©s with "philosopher-king" twist; some phrases ("moth-baited moons") verge on mannered; metaphors more specific than AI-generated defaults but occasionally overwhelming; emotional subtext implied rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Cohesion between elements exists but feels labored; labyrinth metaphor dominates at expense of organic character development; length obscures deliberate design vs compression; leaves thematic residue but narrative mechanics remain semi-opaque.</comment>
