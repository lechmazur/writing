<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's skepticism shapes their actions but lacks deeper exploration of emotional nuance and evolving inner conflict; motivation is coherent but insufficiently layered for full resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Story has atmospheric cohesion but lacks a traditional plot arc; progression feels more like poetic meditation than structured narrative with rising action or definitive resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exquisite, haunting atmosphere via sensory-rich descriptions of a tactile-sonic archive and cosmic transience; some elements (e.g., rideshares) momentarily disrupt the immersive tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptional literary craft with layered metaphors and symbolic resonance; emotional impact lingers through subtext rather than explicit declaration, though depth may elude some readers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi and poetic observation; occasional abstract phrases border on pretension but mostly subvert expectations through meticulous detail and thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Conceptually inventive with lingering emotional questions but sacrifices narrative urgency; elements generally work together though some (drivers, star room) stretch plausibility.</comment>
