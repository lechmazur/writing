<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and physicality, but deeper motivation remains opaque. Assigned trait (spiritual con artist) shapes actions but lacks psychological depth beyond performative surface.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has clear architecture (building act, reversal, climax) that works within constraints. Logical consistency intact, though some beats feel compressed in a way that slightly frustrates emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric flourishes (humming racks as cathedral) compete with underdeveloped setting. Quantum lab tropes function but lack scientific specificity that could deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional control of metaphor and tone. Subtext about truth/performance resonates strongly. Ending balances poetic closure with lingering thematic questions within the conceptual space.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original use of scientific concepts as poetic framework. Some phrases approach ornate abstraction but generally serve mood rather than self-indulgence. Emotional stakes feel earned through symbolic layering.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Competently executes constrained sci-fi-poetic hybrid form. Elements integrate but occasionally rely on genre conventions. Memorable imagery and conceptual twist elevate but don't transcend format.</comment>
