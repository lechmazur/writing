<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations beyond mystical vagueness; archetypal traits (mittens, compass) are superficial rather than revealing; emotional impact of cuddling a child diluted by vague interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot moves through abstract mysticism rather than cause-effect, weakening coherence; some poetic transitions feel arbitrary but hold thematic continuity; resolution feels abrupt despite lyrical momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arctic greenhouse blending frost/citrus creates haunting contrasts; sensory details (steam, crab-apple breaths) immerse readers; setting functions as active participant in riddle’s metaphysics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lush metaphors ("frost writing hieroglyphs"), subtext about maps vs. compassion, and transcendent ending elevate impact; linguistic flow occasionally sacrifices clarity for poeticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes verge on purple prose but mostly succeed through specificity; no clichés, though "sanctified dread" risks abstraction; emotional resonance implied through atmosphere, not stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually but occasionally feel like a fantastical checklist; brevity works for thematic resonance but leaves some threads (e.g., children’s later actions) underdeveloped.</comment>
