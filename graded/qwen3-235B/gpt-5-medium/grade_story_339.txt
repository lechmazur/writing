<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's duality is hinted but remains cryptic; motivations around guilt and closure feel genuine but lack sufficient interiority to fully resonate as a "joyless performer."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear performance-to-resolution arc, but the connection between the rehearsal action and emotional catharsis relies on poetic abstraction that may confuse some readers seeking tighter causality.</comment>
