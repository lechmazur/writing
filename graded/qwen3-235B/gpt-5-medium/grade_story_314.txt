<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations remain abstract, relying on poetic vagueness rather than psychological complexity. The transformation through metaphoric choices lacks concrete emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Premise pivots on surreal occurrences rather than cause-and-effect logic. The abrupt supernatural encounter and ceremonial object retrieval create cohesion but undermine narrative realism. Ending gestures toward resolution without earned consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maritime bureaucracy meets mythic symbolism through vivid, tactile details like salt-stained wood and ancestral shadows. Some elements (tribal rhythm, kelp sentience) strain credibility despite atmospheric richness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors crystallize existential tensions between control and authenticity. The synesthetic imagery (tears spelling names, rhythm-as-ritual) creates lingering resonance, though emotional impact remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Transcendent imagery occasionally lapses into self-indulgence ("salt code," "surf as teacher"). Metaphors maintain originality but occasionally obscure character psychology rather than illuminating it. Subtext exists but risks being dissolved in abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coherence exists in poetic logic rather than narrative architecture. Assigned elements cohere stylistically but thematic weight feels diluted by excessive ornamentation and resistance to concrete meaning.</comment>
