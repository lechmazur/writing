<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically gestured at but lack emotional immediacy; the "cracked heart" interiority is symbolic but insufficiently embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves through lyrical abstraction rather than causality; the structural throughline between cosmic metaphors and the community gatherings feels tenuously metaphysical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and haunting—rust sounds as orchestra, mineralized debris as metaphor—but occasionally risks overshadowing character stakes with poetic density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Language is arrestingly original with cosmic popcorn/oil imagery and recursive metaphors; the "blank sky projection" conceit as collective healing space resonates intellectually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some phrases (e.g., "cracked heart") lean on familiar redemption arcs, but microscope/tuba clown inventions subvert expectations with meticulous strangeness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration is thematically coherent but occasionally ornamental; the story is conceptually daring but its emotional grip could be more urgent.</comment>
