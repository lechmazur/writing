<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character possesses symbolic consistency and clear motivation (avenging archives), but lacks interior complexity; emotional resonance remains abstract due to heavily metaphorical presentation over psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc from exile to confrontation, but compression forces abrupt transitions; the central action maintains momentum despite fragmented progression between pivotal moments.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery establishes eerie atmosphere ("serrated mountains," "gondola groans"), but insufficient grounding in tactile physicality undermines full immersion in the worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric texture ("teeth map seasons," "mapped bites cage breath") elevates the prose, though some emotional weight gets lost in ornate abstractions; the thematic throughline remains potent despite occasional obfuscation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Subverts trope of hero/antihero duality creatively, but occasionally lapses into self-indulgent stylization; the tooth-mark archaeology concept distinguishes it from formulaic approaches despite uneven tonal consistency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements cohere into a unified mythic structure, but surreal abstraction risks alienating readers seeking narrative immediacy; formal constraints paradoxically enhance and restrict the conceptual ambition.</comment>
