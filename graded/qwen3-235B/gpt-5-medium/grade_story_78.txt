<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are poetic but abstract; "softly militant resolve" hints at depth but lacks visceral grounding in personal history or tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear arc but pacing falters: spyglass's role in mapping and the raiders' negotiation feel truncated, relying on lyrical abstraction over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drowned skyline and bathtub farms evoke haunting specificity, though some details ("heavens folded like a letter") verge on overwrought metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("cathedral built from salvage") and layered subtext about power vs. balance elevate the prose; emotional resonance emerges through implication rather than direct statement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids apocalyptic clich√©s but occasionally substitutes "softly militant" and "cosmic balance" for concrete emotional texture; transitions and tone remain cohesive and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like the spyglass and raiders' barter enrich themes without feeling imposed; tighter integration of "reluctant awe" and "cosmic balance" would enhance cohesion.</comment>
