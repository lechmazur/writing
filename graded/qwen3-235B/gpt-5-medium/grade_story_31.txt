<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weaknesses in character nuance; protagonist's emotional arcs remain hinted rather than fully embodied. Strengths: Motivation aligns with actions; symbolism through grafting trees and key interactions reveals thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists through thematic progression rather than dramatic tension. Pacing effective for poetic narrative but lacks traditional arc momentum; the ending feels inevitable rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rich but inconsistent worldbuilding - cyberpunk elements superficially contrast with organic imagery without deep integration. Atmospheric details often prioritize lyricism over visceral sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (trees as memory, key as dialogue catalyst). Ending transcends abstraction through emotional residue. Maintains tension between silence and connection throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of organic and digital motifs avoids genre traps. Avoids clich√©s through paradoxical imagery (excited restraint, soft conspiracy). Occasional risk of pretension but redeemed by emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some (interconnected lives) feel conceptually prioritized over dramatic function. The brevity serves the lyrical tone but sacrifices character depth. Lingering melancholy-optimism hybrid remains potent.</comment>
