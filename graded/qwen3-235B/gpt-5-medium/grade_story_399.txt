<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original and evocative language avoids tropes, though occasional ornateness borders on self-indulgence; emotional subtext feels genuine but requires active reader engagement to parse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Successfully weaves required elements into a thematically rich narrative, though tighter restraint could enhance clarity; the story's philosophical weight occasionally strains the 400-500 word framework.</comment>
