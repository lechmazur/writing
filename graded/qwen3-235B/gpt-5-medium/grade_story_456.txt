<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "morbid florist" and "neutrally passionate" are poetic descriptors rather than motives that shape concrete choices; reactions to cosmic metaphors feel allegorical, not psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot moves through image-heavy progression toward completion of the floral arrangement, but cause-effect logic is diluted by abstract transitions; lantern's flicker bookends the arc but resolution feels symbolic rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo’s surreal premise is atmospherically rendered but feels divorced from narrative stakes; its detachment undermines emotional weight despite vivid sensory details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., tempered beliefs as steel, floral arrangements as cosmic cycles) and imagery (lanterns, chains) create thematic resonance; language elevates into a cohesive meditation on balance, with a striking, conceptually layered ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Originality shines via unexpected combinations (floristry with cosmic cycles), avoiding clichés; prose is lush but precise, never devolving into overwrought abstraction. Subtext about creation/death duality feels fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While conceptually ambitious, the story leans too heavily on metaphor at the expense of emotional immediacy; the blend of elements creates a cohesive aesthetic but struggles to cohere narratively.</comment>
