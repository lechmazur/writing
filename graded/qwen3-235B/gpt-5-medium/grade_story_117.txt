<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but psychological motivations lack depth; thematic resonance with "wisely foolish" and "relaxed" remains more atmospheric than emotionally specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression through surreal elements maintains momentum but feels compressed; the transition from musical notes to final resolution is conceptually coherent but emotionally abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Haunting, sensorially rich atmosphere with vivid imagery of dust mosaics, gramophones, and velvet braille; setting becomes a character in itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in absurd-surreal synthesis; avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction over human nuance in emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High stylistic cohesion with lingering thematic impact; constrained length serves its poetic compression despite slight narrative abruptness.</comment>
