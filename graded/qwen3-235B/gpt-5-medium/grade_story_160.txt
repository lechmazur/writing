<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations despite poetic descriptions of traits. Actions driven by abstract ideas rather than human psychology or emotional stakes. The "analytically free" attribute remains purely conceptual without tangible behavioral manifestation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Fragmented progression from preparation to airship activation exists, but lacks traditional arc. Momentum relies on stylistic flourishes rather than cause-effect logic. Pacing fluctuates between lingering description and rushed mechanical activation without emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory worldbuilding creates immersive decay and resurrection atmosphere. The "curtain dust" and "thinker's canyon" metaphors beautifully fuse theatrical and mechanical elements. However, the connection between backstage graveyard and broader universe remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose creates haunting beauty ("moss exhales dew"). Subtext about defiance of finality resonates through mechanical resurrection motif. Some poetic abstraction sacrifices emotional accessibility despite technical brilliance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Demonstrates meticulous stylistic control with original metaphors ("star-chapped pines"). Avoids genre tropes through theater/mechanical hybridity. Edges toward excessive lyrical density but maintains distinct voice without formulaic phrasing or emotional shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imaginative cohesion exists under scrutiny but relies precariously on stylistic unity over narrative logic. Excessive ornamental language sometimes overwhelms functional storytelling despite dazzling surface. Strong thematic undercurrents remain diffuse rather than piercing.</comment>
