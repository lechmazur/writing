<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Perspective is distinct, but emotional depth remains abstract despite vivid language; motivations feel poetic but lack visceral human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structural symmetry exists but relies too much on metaphorical resonance; narrative arc is conceptually complete yet occasionally obscured by density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Microscopic worldbuilding dazzles with sensory-specific phrases but risks collapsing under its own hyper-specificity; atmospheric cohesion is occasionally lost in technical strangeness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant prose and innovative metaphor use elevate it, but intellectualized emotions prevent full emotional immersion; ending resolves plot without fully satisfying character resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dense originality avoids tropes but flirts with pretension; metaphors like "alloys of pretense corrode" feel human rather than archetypal, though sensory consistency wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically resonant whole despite occasional abstraction; the nano-city isn't just backdrop but a living manifestation of relationship dynamics.</comment>
