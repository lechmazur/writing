<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's moral code is stated but insufficiently demonstrated through action; motivation to humanize the monster feels more thematic than psychologically nuanced, though cryptic precision lends intrigue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot maintains tight logic and momentum through interconnected codes; resolution feels earned despite compressed scope, though time constraints leave some implications underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory fusion of digital and ancient textures creates vivid atmosphere; tea, bottle caps, and carvings ground abstract themes, though some descriptions border on self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dense metaphors (e.g., "razor of confident uncertainty") and layered subtext elevate storytelling; ending achieves emotional resonance by transforming historical erasure into legacy, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in merging cyberpunk, historical recontextualization, and cryptographic ritual; avoids genre tropes through idiosyncratic synthesis, though occasional rhythmic repetition risks ornamental excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements combine with purposeful symbiosis; each component deepens the central theme of reclaiming suppressed narratives, rewarded by the final act of name adoption as ideological inheritance.</comment>
