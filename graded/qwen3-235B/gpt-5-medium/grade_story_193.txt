<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters have distinct voices and symbolic weight, but their backstories and motivations lean on archetypes without sufficient psychological nuance. The prince's confession of loneliness works thematically but lacks visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure uses snowstorm as organic catalyst and closes with cyclical resolution. The key-turning motif sustains cohesion, though some plot mechanics (relic's significance) feel underexplained for complete narrative satisfaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Gothic atmosphere masterfully binds setting to theme - customs tape, dust as exhaled time. Sensory motifs (wintergreen's phantom correspondences) immerse through precise, thematic details that deepen the emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'chapel sound' and 'passport-stamping grief' carry profound subtext. The ending's revelation about attention over medicine achieves elegant thematic payoff. Dialogue balances poetic quality with emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through metaphysical abstraction. Occasional phrases ('familiar unknown') risk preciousness but serve the story's dreamlike logic. Inventive approach to 'improvement' transcends formulaic redemption arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion - each element amplifies core themes. Word economy feels purposeful, building an entire mythos through concentrated details. Leaves resonant questions about memory, belonging, and healing.</comment>
