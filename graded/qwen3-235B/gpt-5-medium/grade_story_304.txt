<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Characters have vivid imagery but underdeveloped interiors; assassin's pivot lacks emotional grounding, driver’s motives remain poetic but opaque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot pivots on a sudden change of heart without sufficient cause; structure implies a circular arc via dawn/bookended journeys, but resolution feels rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting merges baroque decay and sci-fi melancholy masterfully; sensory details (e.g., fountains as constellations, bruised paint) create immersive, haunting atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (lens as moral ambiguity, road as enforced rigidity) and lyrical prose elevate impact; ending subverts expectations with quiet hope, avoiding sentimentality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose balances ornate and precise, avoiding clichés; assassin’s laugh and lens-based perception offer fresh subversion, though some phrases (e.g., “mechanical moths”) lean toward affectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; brevity amplifies poetic resonance, though character logic occasionally falters under scrutiny.</comment>
