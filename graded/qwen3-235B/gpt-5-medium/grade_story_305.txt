<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters have some depth and distinct traits (reticent scholar's silence vs. stagehand's improvisation), but motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically complex or transformative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically between vividly rendered moments, but the compressed arc and fantastical elements (echoes, ancient tablets) create coherence through poetic logic rather than narrative causality, leaving some gaps in plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion via water-lantern symbiosis, dampened acoustics, and cake aroma—each setting element amplifies emotional subtext and thematic tension between decay and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors bloom like the cake itself, with haunting imagery and layered symbolism (drowned opera house as complacency; knocks as artistic provocation) culminating in a thematic resonance that lingers post-reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose avoids cliché, with precise, organic metaphors ("programs as comets") and emotional nuance ("voice ringing like a bell in seawater") that feel deliberately human, not algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements work in intricate counterpoint (ancient vs. improvised, sweet vs. decaying), though the brevity occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over narrative polish, leaving some thematic threads gently fraying.</comment>
