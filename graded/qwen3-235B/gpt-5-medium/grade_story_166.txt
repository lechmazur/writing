<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive but motivations lack depth; "solemnly silly" tone is present but inconsistently sustained. Interactions with animals suggest purpose but the "orchard code" connection feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression from preparation to execution, with geothermal streams as organic narrative engine. Pacing falters slightly during animal communication sequence, which risks feeling episodic rather than cumulatively meaningful within word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lush, specific sensory details (rime jeweled branches, fox laughter) create vivid atmosphere. Thermal contrasts (frozen/geothermal) and temporal context (post-wish) enhance tension. Every element contributes to haunting, lived-in ecology.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric density ("needle-stead shaking," "cross-stitch routes") elevates storytelling. Ending achieves circularity but emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction. Subtext about language's evolution is present but could resonate more viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story avoids most AI-writing traps through striking imagery ("star fruit bruising snow") but occasionally slips into mannered phrasing ("tender inconvenient truths"). Metaphors maintain freshness, though some (woven routes) lean toward over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Elements cohere around communication theme, though expedition logs feel contrived as plot device. Language-as-living-ecosystem concept lingers in reader's mind, elevated by tactile bark-charcoal writings and symphonic inter-species negotiations.</grade>
