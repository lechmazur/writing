<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's dual identity as diplomat/avenger is clear and consistent, driving their calm yet vengeful actions. However, inner conflict lacks nuance despite strong dialogue and distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc with revenge as catalyst and genetic decoding as pivot point. Pacing is efficient in tight word count, though the lab's presence in a children's theater strains plausibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Decay of forgotten city hall and protests create haunting atmosphere. "Must" and radon mural evoke sensory depth, while drum circles contrast bureaucratic inertia with societal urgency. Worldbuilding slightly falters with "organically synthetic" incongruity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose balances poetic imagery ("ledger of blood") with existential tension. Ending resonates as thematic counterpoint to cyclical violence. Subtext about inherited trauma elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids revenge tropes by framing resolution as collective reckoning. Metaphors like "hinge between break/mend" feel original. Subtlety in showing restraint over violence defies formulaic outcomes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve cohesive themes of legacy and choice. Tight prose in short form reveals layered motives. Occasionally strained logic (e.g., lab's plausibility) prevents perfection but maintains depth.</comment>
