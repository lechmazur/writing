<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's introverted dancer identity feels underexploited; mental fortitude drives action but lacks visceral internal conflict; the "illogically logical" trait surfaces through movements but never fully illuminates emotional contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Moments of narrative cohesion exist (dance-as-coding motif), but plot is sacrificed to poetic abstraction; escape trajectory remains vague despite rhythmic structure, creating floating disorientation rather than deliberate pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic atmosphere masterfully rendered through decaying concrete details (dust, rusted charts, metronome panic) and metaphoric mapping of celestial navigation onto human fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Imagery-rich prose transforms escape narrative into existential fugue; every object/concept carries layered symbolism (e.g., bow as farewell to identity); ending achieves elegiac resonance through accumulated metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (stitching longitude into ankles, static as swaddling cloth) feel freshly invented; avoids overt pathos through elliptical expression; style occasionally risks self-parody (constellations "ignoring" their student) but mostly earns transcendence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Brilliant individual sentences but thin narrative skeleton; the "escape" arc is more thematic than actualized; poetic density sacrifices urgent emotional connection required for mainstream literary competitiveness.</comment>
