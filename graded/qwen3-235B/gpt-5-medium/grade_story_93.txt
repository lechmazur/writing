<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's crisis and motivation are poetically implied but lack concrete emotional grounding; "desperate hope" remains abstract rather than manifesting through distinct behavioral choices or nuanced internal conflict beyond metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Narrative momentum relies on poetic associations over cause-effect logic; resolution feels abrupt and disconnected from earlier tension; the 400-word constraint exacerbates structural fragmentation rather than being used purposefully.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rarely cohesive synthesis of archival coldness with organic migration patterns creates haunting atmosphere; sensory details like paper dust and humming electronics elevate the setting beyond mere whimsy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor cascade (whale corridors, wingbeat measurements) creates powerful thematic resonance; subtextual exploration of silent communication works best when not over-explained, though didactic closure harms impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avants-garde vocabulary risks pretension but mostly transcends AI-ness through precise architectural metaphors; no clich√©s, though some phrases ("transparent cliffs") verge on unearned abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic symmetry more than narrative cohesion; the story's strength lies in its ability to make readers linger over its images rather than any structural mastery or emotional payoff.</comment>
