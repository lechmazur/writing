<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weaknesses in motivation clarity; character's slapdash bard identity lacks depth despite strong central 'voice'; emotional responses to sacred space rituals feel gestural rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing uneven in middle; abrupt transition to mirror reflection lacks sufficient buildup; cohesive arc exists but relies too heavily on poetic abstraction over concrete cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually rich environment undermined by inconsistent sensory logic; tectonic plates and cathedral-bell soda create memorable atmosphere but occasionally overwhelm narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic resonance between death and renewal; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on cryptic imagery; metaphors occasionally prioritize style over thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Linguistic freshness contrasts with some overwritten passages; subverts ritual-of-immortality trope; emotional nuance sometimes lost to lyrical excesses like "soda that tastes of cathedral bells."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements interdependent yet occasionally ostentatious; picnic tradition feels organic but strained by surreal mechanics; concise structure achieves surprising thematic density despite occasional abstraction.</comment>
