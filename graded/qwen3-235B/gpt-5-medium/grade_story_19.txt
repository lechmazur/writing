<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains ethereal abstraction; motivations are implied but lack concrete behavioral reinforcement. First-person voice prioritizes poetic imagery over psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot functions as ritualized moment rather than arc; taut structural mirroring between opening/closing actions with scale creates coherence within constrained boundaries.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting achieves vividness through hyper-specific details but struggles with temporal-spatial logic; the "village yurt beyond the hill" introduces jarring spatial ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors accumulate meaning through repetition; subtext about measuring transience is strong though occasional overuse of similes threatens immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original imagery like "bright drifting arithmetic" excels, but phrases like "hoofprints as scripture" border on trope recycling; emotional undercurrents remain stated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>ELEMENTS: Some elements (scale, dandelions) integrate organically, but "receipt code words" and "quiver" feel contrived; thematic unity is strong despite formal inconsistencies.</comment>
