<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's android nature informs actions but lacks nuance in emotional depth; nostalgia and "brazen modesty" are stylistically pronounced but underdeveloped as core traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but leans on poetic abstraction over concrete causal logic; pacing is deliberate but occasionally obscures tension within its lyrical style.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (crystals, frost, brass telescope) but setting specifics (levitation facility's mechanics) remain murky, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and layered subtext (betrayal, artificial conscience) elevate the story; emotional distance may limit some impact but aligns with android narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors and original worldbuilding outweigh occasional ornateness; android's perspective avoids clich√©s but risks over-reliance on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and memorable but burdened by overly elaborate prose in places; thematic ambition outpaces emotional immediacy in spots.</comment>
