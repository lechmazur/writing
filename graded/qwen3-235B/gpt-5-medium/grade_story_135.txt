<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (documenting dialects) and voice, but lacks internal conflict or substantial development beyond serving the story’s thematic aims.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a taut crisis (ice fracturing) and resolution, but the arc from "documenting dialects" to "brewing bridges" feels conceptually compressed, weakening emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visceral and original—mechanical caravans, frostbitten machinery, and the harbor’s industrial decay fuse with the story’s themes of preservation and entropy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like "vowels clinking like coins" and the act of brewing as survival are sharp and layered, though some passages lean on poetic density at the expense of narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Few clichés; the fusion of steampunk machinery and linguistic preservation feels fresh. Occasional risk of ornate phrasing, but largely purposeful and stylistically coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements like the metal straw and dying dialects are woven in, but the story’s brevity and abstract tone leave some themes under-resonant.</comment>
