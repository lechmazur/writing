<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Abstract self-description substitutes for genuine character development; "fact-minded oracle" remains a decorative label rather than shaping meaningful choices or limitations. Voice fluctuates between poetic affectations and philosophical pronouncements without emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Amorphous structure lacks traditional cause-effect progression; vignette-like segments drift without accumulating momentum; plot and resolution dissolve in metaphorical abstraction rather than cohere in any narrative framework.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unstable dimension evokes mood through poetic textures and surreal imagery, but atmospheric details remain surface-level ornaments rather than environments that challenge or shape the protagonist's journey through their physical properties.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional command of metaphor and lyrical prose creates lasting impressions; the conceptual interplay between mathematics and emotion achieves poetic resonance, though some ideas require more narrative embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Some richly crafted passages contrast with structurally predictable cadences; metaphors occasionally overwhelm purpose; tonal shifts between scientific detachment and emotional vulnerability sometimes feel performative rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition outweighs narrative cohesion; while language lingers in the mind, the piece feels more like a language exercise than a story with distinctive authorship; conceptual scaffolding shows through lyrical skin.</comment>
