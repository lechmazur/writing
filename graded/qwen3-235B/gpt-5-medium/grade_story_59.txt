<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract despite poetic treatment; motivations hinted but not fully embodied; interiority prioritizes lyricism over psychological coherence; distinct voice evident but sacrifices depth</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragments of dramatic progression exist but traditional plotting is secondary to metaphysical exploration; circular structure supports thematic concerns despite minimal narrative causality; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ambiguous unity between elements achieves thematic resonance without rigid adherence to realism; story feels purposefully condensed rather than arbitrarily truncated; lingering questions feel intentional yet somewhat impenetrable</comment>
