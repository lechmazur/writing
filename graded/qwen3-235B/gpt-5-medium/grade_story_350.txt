<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's identity as a puppeteer shapes their perceptiveness but lacks depth in personal stakes; motivations (truth-seeking) align with actions but remain abstract and symbolic rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc (discovery → revelation → resolution) functions but relies on poetic leaps rather than clear cause-effect; pacing is atmospheric yet meandering, with abrupt shifts (e.g., ring’s sudden appearance) undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, tactile atmosphere creates immersive intimacy; setting details (burned trunk, salt-stiff gown) deepen thematic resonance, though the temple’s role feels symbolic rather than pragmatically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism and metaphor (e.g., "symphonies of truth," gowns as braille) elevate the prose; thematic cohesion in reconciliation and legacy, but emotional impact relies on abstraction over concrete human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with inventive connections (stamps mapping to grief-soaked cloth); some overwritten imagery risks distancing readers, but the narrative’s ingenuity and subtext (e.g., encoded parental history) outweigh occasional excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on truth and artistry; the compressed form serves the story’s poetic density without feeling cramped, though thematic resonance outweighs narrative urgency.</comment>
