<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's intellectual voice is distinct but lacks psychological depth; motivations tied to "failing publicly" and "diagramming bruise" feel more thematic than personally rooted, with actions aligning conceptually but not emotionally.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a loop from arrival to erasure, but lacks traditional conflict progression; the doll's cracking and algae messages provide structural pivot points, though thematic epiphany feels preordained rather than earned through narrative steps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bay is visceral motif; sensory details like "bathwater laughter" and "electric flares" create immersive tension between fragility and permanence, though post-FTL context remains underexploited beyond thematic backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Luminous metaphors (“school of plankton tracing unknown characters”) and subversion of “monuments” concept offer layered subtext; ending blends resolution and ambiguity effectively, though introspective tone occasionally verges on solipsistic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes like “bright boots and brighter slogans” avoid clichés, but some phrases (“awkward elegance”) risk adornment over function; emotional resonance relies on abstractions (“weakness is a door”) rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story transcends checklist integration by weaving elements into a cohesive metaphor for ephemeral memory; tension between human arrogance and natural erasure persists, though structural minimalism may frustrate readers seeking narrative urgency over atmosphere.</comment>
