<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character voice remains distant and abstract; motivations are hinted at thematically but lack tangible human complexity or conflicting desires. The "amiable" trait is stated rather than revealed through memorable choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows poetically but lacks traditional cause-effect progression; the "waiting room/good news" setup and lighthouse confrontation vaguely connect. Pacing lingers atmospherically rather than driving forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create haunting lighthouse atmosphere - salt-crusted brass, creaking timbers, ghostly lens rotations. The setting actively shapes character and action rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("crossword as navigation," "doubly singular") elevate the prose. The ending resonates thematically, though abstract introspection risks losing emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through poetic specificity ("Fresnel lens vibrating with refused footsteps"). Subtly weaves elemental metaphors without over-explanation, maintaining stylistic consistency despite dense lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual elements cohere thematically but lack visceral urgency; the short form serves its meditative tone well, though emotional stakes remain intellectualized rather than immersive.</comment>
