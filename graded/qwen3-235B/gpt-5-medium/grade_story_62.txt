<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's philosophical pretensions dominate, but motivations for seeking to "rewrite code of existence" remain underexplored and inconsistently tied to his sewer-dwelling state. The voice is distinctive but lacks psychological complexity beneath mannered prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves through poetic conceits rather than narrative momentum; assigned actions (telling stories, mapping existence) occur but lack dramatic tension. The circular structure works but feels more symbolic than emotionally earned due to abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually immersive with strong sensory details (drip of cup, moon-as-notation on leaves). The orchard amphitheater creates effective contrast between decay/nature, though spatial logic occasionally strains (e.g. "fox in gods" feels tacked on).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical density and thematic focus on valuing overlooked things offer profound resonance. The blending of cosmic (code of existence) and domestic (stains, coupons) creates intriguing tension. Ending pays off narrative promises subtly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Overall originality salvages some overwrought metaphors ("biography of rust"). The concept avoids genre tropes but occasionally becomes its own gimmick with too many escalating comparisons lacking emotional ballast.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive despite fantastical elements; story earns its strangeness through consistent internal logic. The brevity works for elegiac tone, though some connections (exile-as-plumbing) could be tighter. Leaves lingering philosophical residue.</comment>
