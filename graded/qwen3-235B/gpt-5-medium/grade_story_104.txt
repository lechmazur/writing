<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character's stoicism is consistently portrayed, but emotional undercurrents could be more complex. Motivation to defy conformity is clear but lacks deeper psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has momentum through curated actions but lacks high-stakes conflict or meaningful progression beyond symbolic gestures. Some pacing issues in middle section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but occasionally overdescriptive, with inconsistent emphasis on temporal setting. Orchard/museum duality is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical language elevates the piece, though emotional resonance is occasionally filtered through abstraction rather than concrete character engagement. Subtext is strong but somewhat predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original approach to theme of subversion through curation. Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into self-consciously literary phrasing that feels mannered rather than authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Effectively structured for impact but lacks thematic weight that might elevate it from strong prose to transcendent literature. Concision works both for and against it.</comment>
