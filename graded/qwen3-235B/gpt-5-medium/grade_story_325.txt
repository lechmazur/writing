<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dr. Mael's eccentricity and plant bargaining hint at depth but remain archetypal, with motivations occasionally eclipsed by whimsical descriptions rather than emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant cause-effect chain in projection mechanics and map revelation, but abrupt shifts in emotional stakes (tourist) and a slightly rushed resolution dilute narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tea house's charged atmosphere and sensory details (storm-charged tea, ionized steam) create visceral immersion, though high-altitude specifics beyond these elements feel underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (film as palimpsest, loyalty as incense), layered symbolism, and a thematically resonant tension between science/mysticism elevate the craft to near-poetic levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Enriches genre tropes (mad scientist, hidden maps) with botanical specificity and surreal technology; only occasional dense adjectives threaten to tip into purple prose without derailing originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere strongly within the story's idiosyncratic logic, though the tourist subplot feels appended rather than integral to the core mystery.</comment>
