<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's rattled state and inward sociability form a superficially intriguing contrast, but the grief revelation feels tacked on. Psychological motivations lack depth despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function, but emotional beats (mother's apron) land awkwardly. The 12-step release lacks narrative weight. Pacing compresses too much into limited space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere shimmering with "listening crowns" and "trenches-to-kitchen" visuals, but the psychic facility's unique qualities remain under-explained compared to the dance lesson motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors ("thoughts dance," "narratives stitched like map lights) elevate the prose, but the exorcism-as-grief-metaphor structure needed subtler handling for maximum emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Refreshingly fuses exorcism with neuroscience, but "brass constellations" and "foxstep sigils" border on baroque excess. Some emotional cues remain overly explicit.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around science-wonder tension, but dance motif and coy aggression serve as decorative flourishes rather than narrative drivers. Lingering questions about grief remain intentionally open-ended.</comment>
