<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character defined through poetic gestures rather than psychological depth; motivation to escape the labyrinth is clear but lacks emotional urgency. Traits like "assertively meek" shape surface actions but not inner life. Narration's poetic abstraction weakens personal connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on metaphorical logic rather than narrative momentum; progression feels associative rather than causally connected. The labyrinth escape via sensory navigation is inventive but underexplained. Pacing is purposeful within constraints but lacks tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (liquefied maps, taste-based directions) create an immersive, surreal atmosphere. Mirage oasis and time distortion amplify disorientation. Tone’s desperate optimism is hinted but underdeveloped beneath stronger imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stylistic precision elevates the story—metaphors (e.g., "machines keep score," "tongue navigates heat") are striking. The ending’s return of the card with "signatures that meant home" resonates thematically, though emotional resonance is subdued.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through linguistic innovation ("xenialize," "quantizing hopes") but occasionally lapses into dense abstraction. Sensory details feel specific but risk overshadowing thematic coherence. Subtext about technology’s alien logic is present but unevenly unpacked.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesion is admirable—elements coalesce into a metaphoric whole. The brief form feels intentional, leveraging brevity for haunting echoes. Lingering questions about technology and agency suggest depth, but emotional stakes remain muted.</comment>
