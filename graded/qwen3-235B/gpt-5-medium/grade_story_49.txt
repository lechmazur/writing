<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically implied but lack concrete conflict or evolution; traits like "lukewarm" and "loyally peculiar" shape atmosphere more than decisive action; emotional undercurrents present but underdeveloped through dialogue or pivotal choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot unfolds organically through atmospheric tension rather than external stakes; cause/effect logic between magic, echoes, and Commander Rhee’s hesitation is implied but cohesive; pacing lingers lyrically but struggles to anchor a traditional arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is atmospherically immersive through tactile details (reclaimed vapor tea, charred serenity’s temperature contrasts) but occasionally overwhelming; lunar base’s isolation and fragility are evoked via synesthetic descriptions that prioritize mood over functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose wields metaphor with surgical precision; subtext about collective trauma/repair lingers beneath quiet magic; tension between memory and hope resonates through sensory symbolism rather than exposition; ending’s withheld catharsis deepens thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unique combinations (stage fog as therapeutic tool, constellations on doormats) avoid tropes but occasionally veer into overwrought abstraction; emotional nuance wins over "show don’t tell" but risks poetic redundancy; tone remains distinct despite occasional metaphor density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story transcends assigned elements through thematic cohesion but struggles with narrative propulsion; each component serves the tone yet feels curated for poetic impact over organic storytelling; depth lingers, but visceral engagement is secondary to stylistic awe.</comment>
