<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's unique voice as a disinterested poet-forager resonates, but motivations lack layered human contradiction - shielding yeast feels more like narrative device than emotionally grounded pursuit, with forgetfulness treated superficially rather than as psychological defense or virtue</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragmented episodic moments create surreal momentum but lack structural integrity - inspector's resolution feels like narrative deus ex machina through "taste met echo" hand-waving; vault's cultural clash introduced too late for coherent resolution within constraints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Carbonated hush and cathedral-hued foam create immersive synesthetic world; yeast's light-reactive properties ground fantastical elements in tangible science-poetry; municipal guardians vs. banlieue kitchens juxtaposition offers rich cultural stratigraphy through scent and architecture</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("foam finding weaknesses," "night humming") create thematic resonance about preservation vs. progress; subtext of commodification's threat to living history lingers; tension between scientific precision and street-level improvisation maintained through tactile imagery</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Verdant sensory details avoid clichÃ© (street moss > ordinary foliage), but occasionally over-flourish into opacity ("subaudible harmonics"); cultural clash framing avoids easy binaries yet occasionally strains plausibility through compressed abstraction</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story succeeds as vivid prose poem but falters under highest-tier fiction demands - tightly packed elements create sense of imposed architecture rather than organic evolution; emotional beats remain more atmospheric than viscerally human despite formal elegance</comment>
