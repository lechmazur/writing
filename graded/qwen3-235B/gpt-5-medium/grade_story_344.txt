<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's claustrophobia and motivation are conceptually present but underdeveloped; actions (counting cups, jam-tasting) illustrate curiosity but lack emotional urgency or transformation in relation to stated traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows with poetic logic rather than traditional structure; jam-tasting technique drives character interactions effectively, but the "resolution" feels more atmospheric than narrative-driven, weakening emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely crafted through precise sensory details (plum steam, creaking walls) that harmonize with the ethereal setting and emotional subtext without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful poetic devices (tea as emotional key, floating house as trust metaphor) create lingering resonance; dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with theme of quiet revelation emerging organically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some metaphorical language feels fresh (constellations of trust), but recurring similes (e.g., "like a heart learning a kinder tide") accumulate toward preciousness; emotional nuance is shown rather than stated but occasionally borders on ornamental abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through consistent metaphorical language, but several required elements feel more decorative than essential to the narrative's core; brevity works both as a strength (focus) and limitation (depth).</comment>
