<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's 'remorseful conjurer' trait shapes actions but lacks emotional depth; voice is poetic but motivation remains abstract, blurring consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses via interactions with objects, but pacing falters in tight word limit; cause/effect in surreal logic is consistent, yet resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (shipwrecks, salt-fat bees) create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that deepens mystery and supports the abstract tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors and subtext (e.g., "plant the spotlight as a tree") are evocative; ending resonates thematically, though some ideas lack narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality is strong, but the dense, ornate style occasionally veers into purple prose; emotional nuance is implied through imagery rather than clich√© exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story integrates assigned elements cohesively, though some (e.g., timeframe) feel peripheral; style elevates brevity into a deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
