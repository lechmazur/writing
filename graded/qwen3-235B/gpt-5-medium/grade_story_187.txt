<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's stoicism remains underdeveloped as a driving force; necessary lies lack visceral stakes despite lyrical exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows with dreamlike logic but key moments (teacher's test, ghost vision) feel compressed rather than earned, relying on atmosphere over structural precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clay-cracked sensory details (chalk-moths, moon-dust) and tonal paradoxes (burnt-sage tenderness vs. erasure) create immersive, contradictory logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphor density achieves incantatory power; ending subverts archiving trope by demanding erasure as preservation method. Theme of memory-as-erasure lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echoing phrases ("necessity," "mesmerizing blandness") avoid AI-like repetition; vocabulary serves texture without excess. Nuanced emotional subtext through gesture, not declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements (floorboard, nightmares) fuse with narrative architecture; some assigned concepts (trail of nightmares) feel more symbolic than functionally integrated.</comment>
