<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic rather than fully developed; motivations inferred through ritualistic actions rather than explicit internal logic, creating distance between reader and figure despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative flows from ritual to mission with poetic momentum, but compressed arc lacks space for tension; coffee-ground mapping resolves too abstractly to feel earned within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (barnacled cutlass, banshee heat) create haunting atmosphere; setting bridges digital and primal, enhancing thematic contradictions without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid symbolism elevates the story beyond surface plot, though emotional resonance remains diffuse. Coffee-ground parallels as glyphs offer intriguing subtext about erasure and interpretation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending digital nomads with mystical divination, but some phrases ("cocoa-colored galaxies") flirt with preciousness; emotional undertones implied rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dense poeticism creates mood over cohesion; elements form mosaic rather than unified structure, though the closing return to "unfinished tales" lingers provocatively.</comment>
