<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but thinly developed; inner conflict is suggested but not fully realized within constraints. The bard's practicality vs. longing creates tension but lacks deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed; hidden compartment discovery occurs abruptly, undermining momentum. The thematic connection between accepting the screw and becoming a guardian is coherent but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion in steampunk submarine library; tactile details (oilskin diary, chuffing valves) create vivid, otherworldly atmosphere. The street fairs above contrast well but feel loosely integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose ("whale ribs," "tidal map of stories") elevates theme of balancing machine and humanity. Ending resonates emotionally through symbolic gestures rather than explicit explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Imagery is fresh but occasionally verges on overwrought ("laughter filtering through bilge vents like quicksilver"). The "precisely imperfect" motif avoids clich√© but struggles against AI-typical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive through strong central metaphor but relies on atmospheric momentum over narrative propulsion. The brevity works thematically yet leaves emotional weight partially unrealized.</comment>
