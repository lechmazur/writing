<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Outlaw poet's attributes shape his curious, performative voice, but secondary character's motivation remains cryptic. His use of dice as a literary device reveals thematic purpose, yet emotional consistency and conflict depth are minimal. The astronomer's compass scar and equations hint at unexplored interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rehearsal timeline imposes structure, but plot pivots on mystical wall-changing rather than organic causality. Misalignment action drives the climactic lens reveal, but the narrative arc feels condensed to thematic fragments rather than earned progression. Pacing alternates between lyrical linger and abrupt revelation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Steampunk dome's brass sweat and candle fog create tactile immediacy. Coffee shop walls' trembling text mirrors metaphoric fluidity. Atmosphere merges scientific and poetic registers flawlessly through sensory alchemy—ink on gloves, cooling metal clicks—to materialize saturated ambivalence as physical reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sublime metaphor density ("ambivalence saturate into navigable compass," "lariats catching falling stars") transcends gimmickry. The unresolved outlaw-astronomer dynamic and theatrical confession offer emotional resonance beyond ornate surfaces. Ending's earned ambiguity about purposeful chaos satisfies as thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality lies in blending outlaw poetics with cosmic mechanics. Avoids clichés through concrete metaphors like "nebula of proof" rather than stating cosmic connections. Prose walks tightrope between elaborate diction and precision—when describing "letters tumble spelling destinies," the latter half redeems potential purple phrasing through emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into unified symbol system: shifting walls inform destiny, dice mechanize curiosity, misalignment births revelation. Every fantastical element serves thematic purpose. The steampunk-western fusion and "walk apart together" vow linger in mind as profound meditation on collaborative inquiry.</comment>
