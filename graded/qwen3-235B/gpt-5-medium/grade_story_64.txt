<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's uncertainty and alchemical skills drive the dilemma, but motivations around sister feel underdeveloped; ethical choice resonates but lacks visceral personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Concise arc between verdict tension and forest exit works, but pacing stumbles slightly under the weight of dense worldbuilding; cause-effect logic holds despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marble floor scuffs as cartographic memory and floating markets create immersive strangeness; inconsistent connection between marketplace setting and forest quest slightly weakens cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., "map as prayer") deepen theme; ending subverts transactional tropes elegantly; layered treatment of time preservation through object and action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through idiosyncratic imagery (floor scuff topography, "whispering a chant that tastes like rain on brass"); balances ornate prose with purposeful restraint in critical moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements harmonize into thematically coherent whole; the brief form feels artistically justified through symbolic efficiency rather than constraint; lingers through metaphorical resonance.</comment>
