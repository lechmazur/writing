<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is vividly imagined through surreal actions, but motivation remains abstract. Assigned trait 'naturally peculiar' shapes aesthetics but lacks deeper psychological nuance. Character's linguistic interactions are original but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows through lyrical abstractions rather than conventional causality. The accidental meeting as inciting incident creates loose cohesion, but the dream logic sacrifices tight structural resolution. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Richly textured sensory environment with synesthetic details (spice-as-emotion, city-as-language) creates immersive, unique atmosphere. Every element contributes to the metaphysical tone, making the world itself a narrative force that transcends literal storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exquisite use of metaphor (mappings as mourning, speech as spatial navigation) creates haunting resonance. The story's voice remains consistent while layered with subtext about linguistic borders and mental cartography. Ending achieves thematic closure without narrative redundancy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synesthesia of senses (emotions as spices, language as architecture) feels uniquely human. No tropes or sentimental shortcuts; even sentimental themes are refracted through imaginative metaphors. The prose balances density and precision, avoiding algorithmic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Every assigned element serves thematic or atmospheric purpose. The unconventional narrative structure and abstract tone feel deliberate rather than constrained. Leaves residue of philosophical questions about language and grief, satisfying literary ambitions despite emotional distance.</comment>
