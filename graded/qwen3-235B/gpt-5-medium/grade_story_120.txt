<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are obscured by metaphorical abstraction; their actions occasionally align with their 'steady impatience,' but emotional depth is sacrificed to poetic diction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Time-loop structure creates circular progression, but cause-effect logic falters in the tunnel's metaphysical rules; cohesion exists but feels strained by compressed word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Quantum tunnel's memory-amplifying qualities and dust-choked quiet create haunting atmosphere; underutilized potential in reconciling 'privately public' city contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, original metaphors ('patience that knows when screams arrive') and thematic emphasis on trauma-as-passenger resonate; emotional resonance diluted by excessive abstraction in key moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine sentence structures and dense imagery occasionally tip into self-indulgence; fresh metaphors ('pretense is practice for courage') shine, but tonal shifts lack cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements interweave conceptually but lack visceral urgency; theme of looping trauma lingers, yet brevity leaves some threads feeling schematic rather than organic.</comment>
