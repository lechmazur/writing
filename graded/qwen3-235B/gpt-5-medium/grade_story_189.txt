<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's 'bright-eyed' trait overshadowed by literal mind, which influences actions but lacks emotional grounding. Motivation to decode maps is present but underexplored; final reaction to cosmic revelation feels flat, undermining depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on decoding notes, but cause-effect between elements (e.g., war's impact, ghostly interactions) remains opaque. Ending feels abrupt rather than earned; pacing strains to cover scope within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic lighthouse atmosphere is vividly rendered through brine, rust, and electrical tension. Sensory details immerse but sometimes overwhelm narrative function, particularly with underdeveloped war context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (cosmic invoices, light as memory) elevate thematic depth. Story's "brazen calm" tone and archetypal tension between human fragility and cosmic bureaucracy linger intellectually.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of pulp sci-fi and mythic undertones; cosmic ledger-keeping subverts cosmic indifference tropes. Occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism, but inventiveness outweighs purple prose risks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements cohesively but leaves threads ambiguously unresolved. The cosmic accounting conceit offers thematic resonance, though brevity sacrifices deeper character or plot development.</comment>
