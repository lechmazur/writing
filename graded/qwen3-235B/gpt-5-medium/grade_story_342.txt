<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (emancipation from borrowed memories) is clear but internal conflict only superficially rendered through metaphor. "Careless pilot" trait echoes but lacks psychological depth; actions align with stated goals but emotional resonance feels abstract rather than viscerally earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows emancipation arc with poetic logic but sacrifices narrative momentum for lyrical digression. The action of "investigating postcards" drives structural changes but causal chain between symbolic elements occasionally muddies; resolution feels inevitable yet compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard labyrinth and storm-befitting atmosphere merge sensually through synesthetic details (e.g., "mold, citrus, and fuel") and living setting. Thunder/timeline creates tension between stasis and release; every sensory choice deepens the liminal world's haunting quality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("oaks humming like engines") and symbolic economy impress. Ending resonates thematically but emotional undercurrent remains diffuse; avoids pat closure while leaving subtler psychological layers underexplored despite poetic craftsmanship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unconventional metaphors and setting fusion succeed, though occasional ornate phrasing ("resigned exuberance") teeters toward mannerism. Lacks genre tropes; while not formulaic, psychological nuance occasionally gives way to atmospheric dominance over character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly weighted - glove/orchard symbolism transcendent while archival drive feels secondary. Achieves lyrical compression rather than narrative urgency; lingers in memory without piercing profundity.</comment>
