<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is vividly voiced but motivations remain abstract, leaning into poetic abstraction over psychological realism. "Brazen humility" as a trait shapes voice but lacks nuance in reactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent structure centers on a performance arc with rising tension and resolution, but lacks significant stakes beyond poetic spectacle. The beginning-middle-end progression is effective but minimal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive unity of form and theme justifies its constrained scope. While poetic brilliance aligns with content, the emotional immediacy occasionally falters beneath conceptual density.</comment>
