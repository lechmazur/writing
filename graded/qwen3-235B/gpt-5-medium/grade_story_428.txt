<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and internally consistent, with contradictions between "rarely authentic" confidence and the ink blotter's symbolism revealing depth. However, the transition from prepper to temple savior feels undermotivated, requiring reader inference rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong circular structure bookended by the handshake moment creates tension and resolution. Pacing maintains focus on the central choice while interweaving exposition efficiently. Some minor confusion about how sluice calibration connects to constellations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative but superficial atmosphere - storm, temple carvings, and ritualistic village activity create mood, but lack cultural specificity that would fully realize the Indian temple setting as more than a mystic backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Polished metaphors ("living skeleton of a city") and thematic coherence elevate the piece. The ending's symbolic weight works despite dense prose. Subtext about urban planning as destruction/renewal resonates powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through poetic abstraction - "debase" as pivotal action, ink blotter's lineage of signatures, and constellations as mythic map are fresh. However, temple setting borders on generic mysticism without distinctive cultural grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements are tightly employed with thematic purpose. Story sacrifices some character depth for lyrical compression but maintains cohesion. Final image of water's handshake with fields lingers as poignant metaphor for integrity.</comment>
