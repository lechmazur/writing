<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Linguistically vivid but lacks concrete emotional or psychological depth; motivation exists as existential abstraction, not personal journey</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through tone rather than structure; feels like distilled essence of a longer work's philosophical spine</comment>
