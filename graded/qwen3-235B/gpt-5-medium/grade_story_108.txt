<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's vexed nature is present but underexplored; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance, with internal conflict (duty vs. artistic integrity) hinted rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a discernible arc of crowd control, but the compressed structure leaves the resolution feeling rushed; cause-effect logic holds but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive (e.g., "slag-warm platform," "stardust"), with striking metaphors elevating setting, though some details (tapestry of fate) border on abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant prose creates lingering resonance; subtext about authority and dissent is compelling, but emotional engagement suffers from heavy reliance on stylized descriptions over character-driven stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "ballads wanted to kneel to stardust") balance occasional purple prose; family-movie tradition feels contrived but most elements avoid rehashing genre tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as literary mosaic with deliberate compression, though thematic cohesion occasionally falters under the weight of dense poetic imagery and loosely connected motifs.</comment>
