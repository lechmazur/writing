<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Minimal character depth; protagonist's "objectively emotional" trait lacks exploration or impact on actions; sentinel functions as poetic device rather than dimensional character; motivation to "resurrect meaning of home" remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Purposefully fragmented structure suits surreal setting but lacks traditional arc; action flows within dream logic but resolution remains opaque; thematic throughline exists but lacks visceral payoff within constrained format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Immersive setting with striking sensory details (time smelling of lightning, resin-bound terminal dusk); atmosphere coalesces into self-contained reality; time-fractured lounge concept executed with precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Provocative metaphors and poetic phrasing evoke deeper meaning about belonging; ending delivers emotional resonance through bodily "passport" imagery; "showing" rather than telling dominates with few missteps.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinctive voice avoids formulaic patterns; occasional overwriting ("letters glitch" + "constellations of cancellations") veers toward preciousness; maintains tonal consistency despite surreal elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>Tightly woven world persists despite conceptual overload; elements elevate story beyond mere inventory checkmarking; emotional core slightly obscured by stylistic exuberance; lingers through metaphor rather than character.</comment>
