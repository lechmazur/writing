<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's melancholic resolve and symbolic use of the trident convey depth, but motivation remains abstract without concrete backstory or emotional nuance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in concept and tone, though the brevity leaves thematic undercurrents underexplored; resonant but not transcendent.</comment>
