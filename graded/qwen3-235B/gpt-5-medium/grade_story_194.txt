<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lumberjack's traits are occasionally referenced but often overshadowed by poetic abstraction; motivations align with actions but lack visceral emotional grounding; the first-person voice is lyrical but risks obscuring character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot has an arc from coded letter to sanctuary shift, but cause/effect between nightmares and dinner changes feels ambiguous; pacing rushes key character conflicts while lingering on atmospheric flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich tactile detail in ossuary-restaurant elements; bike rides as timeframe aren't fully integrated with setting; some sensory overload diluting intentional mood contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting metaphors (bones as flutes, gunmetal dreams) create lasting resonance; themes of healing vs. commodification emerge through subtext; ending ties to thematic throughline of cyclical conflict/sustenance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High linguistic polish sustains atmosphere; elements cohere into a singular vision despite uneven integration of timeframe/plot mechanics; leaves intellectual resonance over emotional immediacy.</comment>
