<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character is implied through metaphor and action rather than interiority; traits like "coy spy" shape behavior but internal logic feels more symbolic than psychologically rooted. Motivation (disguise mastery) is clear but its emotional weight remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plotted with elegant cause-effect (reverse-time potion enables mending fences), but the compressed arc relies heavily on poetic abstraction. Some pacing feels rushed in the middle, though the cyclical structure reinforces the theme.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (reversing hourglasses, churning violets) create a mythic, claustrophobic atmosphere. The potion brewery’s alchemy directly shapes both plot and thematic tension between mending and erasure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("greasepaint for the unsaid self") and recursive imagery ("creases in time") evoke existential duality. The ending’s thematic resonance—disguise as self-erasure—lingers, though subtle exposition weakens emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Verdant prose avoids cliché (witch as "raven offering trinkets") but walks a tightrope near ornateness. Emotions are shown through symbolic action (button rethreading) rather than stated, though some phrases (e.g., "river-still eyes") risk abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>7.4</comment><comment>Cohesive through metaphorical threading. Uses constraints inventively (e.g., "mended fences" as temporal and interpersonal repair), though the brevity leaves thematic undertones (e.g., identity dissolution) less fully explored.</comment>
