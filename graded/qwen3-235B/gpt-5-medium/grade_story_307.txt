<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and actions aligned with quiet rebellion, but emotional dimensionality remains abstract rather than viscerally grounded through specific interactions or stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric continuity but lacks traditional plot momentum; reliance on mood over tangible progression feels both intentional and limiting within the brief format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exhilarating sensory texture—city breathing, neon hues, tactile repairs—constructs a mythic urban twilight that mirrors the protagonist’s liminal struggle between decay and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (e.g., "belief heavier than a transformer") and symbolic alchemy of broken media into collective hope achieve visceral emotional resonance through craft rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Avoids sentimentality through concrete imagery; the DVD’s scratched-to-constellation transformation subverts clichéd redemption arcs; prose balances ornate precision with thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive as a standalone mood piece, though conceptual heaviness occasionally strains the brevity; thematic density rewards reflection but risks overshadowing narrative intimacy.</comment>
