<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character’s traits shape her patient, tactile approach, but motivation—while clear—isn’t interrogated deeply; lacks nuanced internal conflict beyond thematic exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot arcs cleanly from quest to revelation, but pacing occasionally lags in the middle; the ember’s role feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and singular, with sensory details (acid rain, dissolving leaves) inseparable from the story’s identity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through vivid, unclichéd imagery (e.g., "chalk ghosts") and subverts "chosen one" tropes; logic feels human, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a unified meditation on leadership; concise yet dense with meaning, though minor pacing flaws temper the peak impact.</comment>
