<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character as nostalgic tailor is present through metaphorical actions (stitching futures, fabric-as-sky), but inner conflicts lack visceral depth; motivations are poetic but not emotionally grounded in human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant cyclical structure around broken code/bookend ascension arcs, but pacing is uneven: storms and parallel selves unfold conceptually, not through concrete narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Steampunk machinery and mirror imagery create a tactile, haunting atmosphere; storm dynamics and metallic textures immerse readers but occasional description overload mutes emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose (stitching the sky, memory as sail) delivers poetic impact; subtext about reconciling fractured identities through craft elevates the narrative beyond surface flight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in tailoring-as-metaphysical-act subverts genre tropes, but phrases like "clock about to weep" lean into ornamental abstraction that risks distancing readers from visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>High-concept cohesion achieves thematic unity while exploring existential agency, though the brevity prevents full emotional payoff despite strong symbolic architecture.</comment>
