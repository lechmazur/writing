<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel symbolic rather than naturally emergent. The resolution of her defiance against gods feels more thematic than character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses through surreal actions but lacks tension. Pacing is poetic yet meandering; the ending satisfies thematically but lacks structural complexity within the constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely rendered with sensory precision; fog, orchard decay, and forge create a cohesive mythopoeic world that actively shapes the narrative's emotional core.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("tea-cooled forging," "apples like held breath") creates layered meaning. The ending resonates through symbolic coherence rather than conventional resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Weaves lyrical style without indulgence; avoids most AI clich√©s through specific imagery ("weather that tasted like stone"). Emotional subtext is implied rather than stated, offering human nuance beneath the allegory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements interlock to create a resonant mythic whole. While brief, the story feels intentional rather than limited, leaving a lingering meditation on resistance and creation in desolation.</comment>
