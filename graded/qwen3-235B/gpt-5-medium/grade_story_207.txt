<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to break a blood-sealed oath is clear, but psychological depth remains surface-level; the "forthright peddler" trait feels more symbolic than psychologically resonant, with voice occasionally undercut by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc from entry to release is coherent within constraints, but the central action of "dividing ghosts" leans heavily on metaphor rather than concrete plot mechanics; pacing is deliberate but occasionally stalls in lyrical interludes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through visceral sensory details: the antiseptic tang, the ventilation's sigh, the cracked visor's fractured reflection create a haunting, lived-in atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (credit-as-truth, silence as barter) elevate the story, though the ending's emotional payoff feels slightly muted; the central conflict with the self is conceptually rich but emotionally restrained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong originality in AI-written obituaries and plasma-as-contracts concepts; avoids genre clichés but occasionally sacrifices narrative momentum for dense poetic phrasing that borders on ornamental.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into a unified symbolic system; the story’s true "character" is the setting itself, with human elements functioning more as allegory than lived experience.</comment>
