<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ambiguous motivation despite clear emotional beats. Character traits like "professional wildness" are stated but not fully dramatized through action or conflict. The daughter serves more as symbol than person, and Leena's role remains emotionally cryptic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Modest forward momentum through dual timelines and task-driven labor, but the plot relies on thematic resonance rather than cause-effect mechanics. The 400-word compression creates a sense of poetic gesture over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly specific industrial-seaside sensory palette (ozone tang, rust scent, metallic chime) creates immersive strangeness, yet the ozone station's scientific function remains decorative rather than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Powerful imagery ("nerves as tinsel," "flag as postcard") elevates craftsmanship, though emotional payoff feels deferred rather than earned. Subtext about art enduring environmental collapse emerges but lacks structural emphasis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some lush metaphors border on self-indulgence ("sky scars"), while the "quarantine paddleboarding" backstory reveals nuanced connection through method rather than trope. Tonal consistency wavers between blue-collar grit and environmental allegory.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elaborate linguistic textures overshadow narrative cohesion - elements like the daughter's threshold/school bus feel more like thematic counterpoint than organic story components. Ambiguous relationship between assigned elements suggests strained conceptual scaffolding.</comment>
