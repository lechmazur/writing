<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Protagonist's orchardist background informs meticulous pattern recognition, but internal emotional depth lags behind metaphorical richness. Motivation from brother's death is clear but occasionally eclipsed by stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Plot unfolds with mechanical precision, each revealed detail escalating toward confrontation. Occasional abrupt shifts in revelation slightly undercut tension, but tightly controlled arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visceral juxtaposition of organic decay (orchards) with sterile facility creates potent atmosphere. Sensory details (glue, ultraviolet lamps) and peacock symbolism coalesce into cohesive, haunting mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with devastating metaphors ("conspiracies unravel best when they realize their encore"). Ending resonates thematically, though some conceits flirt with overextension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality bursts from unconventional spy craft (paper plane data encoding) and thematic parallels. Occasional phrase density ("orchardist by trade, trained to read blight in leaves the way gamblers read loaded dice") skirts ornate but rarely collapses into mannerism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements fuse into seamless whole where each component serves multiple narrative functions. The final image of "spring pruning" lingers as emotionally resonant thematic capstone.</comment>
