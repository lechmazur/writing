<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character is distinct but motivations feel conceptually abstract rather than psychologically grounded. The blend of "righteous flaw" and alien identity lacks organic emotional stakes despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure remains coherent but lacks narrative tension. The climax feels symbolic rather than earned through character or thematic progression within the constraints of the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pervasive, immersive atmosphere via sensory details (steam, organ reverberations, mosaic textures). Timeframe and setting fusion creates hauntingly specific historical/futuristic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Uses poetic compression effectively. Metaphors (e.g., "organ speaking in slow vowels") and symbolic objects achieve thematic resonance. Ending achieves reflective emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original in concept synthesis but occasionally veers into pseudo-profound abstraction. Some overwritten passages border on stylized vagueness rather than precise literary invention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite complex element load. Elements function as integrated metaphors rather than checklist items, with only minor moments of thematic overstatement.</comment>
