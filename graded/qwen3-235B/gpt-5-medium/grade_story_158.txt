<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's optimism and "polite chaos" are conceptually present but remain abstract, lacking grounded motivations or emotional arcs. Voice is distinct yet cerebral rather than psychologically resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narrative lacks traditional plot progression; tension resides in linguistic abstraction rather than cause-effect storytelling. Pacing feels diffuse within the constrained word limit, with resolution achieved through poetic gesture rather than narrative mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Luminous, tactile atmosphere created through crystalline imagery and sensory details (breath's condensation, dripping ice sounds) that make the setting inseparable from thematic concerns. Cold, fragile environment mirrors existential stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exquisite control of metaphor ("grammar of fractal sorrow," "translate hush into maps") and evocative subtext create lasting resonance. Ending achieves synthesis of image and theme without overexplaining, prioritizing emotional implication over exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maintains cohesion through recurring motifs but occasionally prioritizes poetic density over narrative function. Assigned elements create structural scaffolding rather than feeling organically inevitable, though imagery lingers powerfully in the mind after reading.</comment>
