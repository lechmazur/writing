<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and consistent, with guilt shaping every action; motivations are clear but interiority could be deeper to fully inhabit the protagonist’s turmoil.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from sin to confrontation to partial redemption cohesively; pacing is urgent yet compressed, with the chipped bowl’s revelation slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gothic-mystic setting uses evocative details (candle steadiness, unmothered names), but the witch’s chamber lacks ecological logic, weakening immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., “guilt-ridden,” “compost”) deepen theme; some telling over-showing dilutes impact, yet the ending’s circularity resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Style occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction (“murder of paper birds”), but the voice feels human; avoids clichés with precise inventions like “unacknowledged” names.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical fusion of guilt and redemption feels purposeful, though the ending’s “forgiveness might someday catch up” risks vagueness; overall, the story lingers.</comment>
