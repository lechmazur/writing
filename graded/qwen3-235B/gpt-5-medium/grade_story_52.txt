<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between thievery and redemption is hinted at but lacks psychological depth; motivations are poetically implied rather than dramatically demonstrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ('bathymetry for hearts') betray aspirational lyricism; emotional beats occasionally told rather than shown through action, but original voice prevents formulaicity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>High-concept elements threaten cohesion, but unified tone and recursive structure compensate; formal inventiveness serves theme more than narrative clarity.</comment>
