<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive, and phobias inform actions. Some motivations feel plot-driven rather than psychologically deepened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear through-line from envelope discovery to ritual dance. Pacing compresses mysteries; some leaps in logic regarding library's mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral, hallucinatory sensory details create tangible atmosphere; sand-struck silence of pyramid library lingers in memory.</comment>
