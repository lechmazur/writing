<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's emotional complexity is implied through poetic description rather than deep introspection; voice is distinct but motivation remains abstract rather than fully realized through concrete actions or changes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing is deliberate but occasionally uneven; the loop from vigilance to surrender is conceptually satisfying but relies on atmospheric momentum rather than tight structural causality between scenes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is immersive and thematically integral, with vivid, original sensory details that amplify existential and digital decay; however, the abstract nature of the world occasionally risks overshadowing physical specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is richly layered with metaphor and musicality, evoking profound reflection on identity and release; the ending lingers memorably, though some imagery veers toward density without clear payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through inventive blending of digital and corporeal metaphors; minor issues with occasional overuse of abstract phrasing that blurs rather than sharpens meaning, bordering on affectation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements are woven into a cohesive, resonant whole that feels purposeful rather than formulaic; the narrative’s emotional and philosophical depth transcends its constraints, though some poetic flourishes slightly obfuscate clarity.</comment>
