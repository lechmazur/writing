<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivations are clear but emotionally distant; actions (e.g., offering himself as collateral) align with escape from violence, but inner conflict remains underdeveloped despite poetic narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc is complete but pacing feels compressed; key interactions (e.g., with veteran) lack expansion. The "probably improbable" plan resolves too smoothly, weakening tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting thrums with decaying grandeur—oxidized beauty, moss-choir beams, and the tactile act of planting—evokes a world where violence and renewal coexist through sensory-rich, visceral details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors ("corroded rapture," "kneaded courage") and symbolic acts (burying blades, mirrored paddies) create layered meaning. The ending transcends closure, suggesting ongoing, fragile tending of self and land.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory details feel specific, but phrases like "choir of beams" risk ornate abstraction. Some emotional beats rely on poeticism over character nuance, and the pact resolution leans on archetypal "peace-making" arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility (spectacles' role, elders’ abrupt compliance). The brevity sharpens focus but sacrifices depth in secondary dynamics.</comment>
