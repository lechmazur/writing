<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation ties to defiance against prejudice, but deeper emotional grounding is lacking; the captain's actions align with the trait, but interiority remains impressionistic rather than fully developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tight 400-500 word structure maintains cohesion; plot advances through eerie logic of maze navigation; resolution at the rotating chamber provides satisfying convergence of cause-effect relationships despite constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (heartbeat speakers, rust-bleeding reflections) create immersive atmosphere; setting-as-metaphor for systemic oppression is vividly rendered through distorted glass and "dying tree" symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful use of cosmic echoes as metaphor; the prison rope and mirror distortions carry layered symbolism; ending's theme of resistance through self-acceptance resonates beyond surface narrative without becoming didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing through original metaphors ("storm refuses to choose a favorite roof"); some phrases ("thin stars") border on romanticism but retained purpose; maintains human nuance despite surrealism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive synthesis of assigned elements; each component serves symbolic and narrative functions; the brief length enhances the mythic quality rather than constraining it; begs rereading to unpack subtext.</comment>
