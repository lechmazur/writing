<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth beyond poetic symbolism; dialogue and actions serve conceptual flair over human-like nuance, though voice retains a distinctive surrealism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear tension or resolution; poetic rhythms substitute structured pacing, though the cyclical opening/closing of the orchard provides minimal arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orchard-as-technology setting immerses through tactile details (ozone, rattling ladders); fusion of folkloric and scientific imagery creates haunting atmosphere, though internal logic remains opaque.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("comedy as sacred lubricant") provoke thought; thematic duality of repair/humanity's cosmic dialogue resonates, though overreliance on abstract language weakens emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in juxtaposing quantum cosmology with orchard metaphors; avoids clich√©s but occasionally drowns in its own ornate diction, straining readability. Sensory details rarely generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lyrical language elevates conceptually, but thematic coherence suffers from excessive stylistic abstraction; length works for vignette but undermines narrative complexity.</comment>
