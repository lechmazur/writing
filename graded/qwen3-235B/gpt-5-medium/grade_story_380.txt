<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Non-corporeal existence and abstract guilt limit traditional development; actions reveal internal state through poetic gestures, but concrete motivations remain murky. First-person voice is distinct but self-conscious.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmented structure resists conventional arcs; the plunge provides physical and symbolic progression, but causal connections between elements (e.g., tribunal, sport, thunder) are intuitive rather than rigorously logical within the constrained space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Architectural impossibilities (treehouse library, sky hole) create palpable melancholy. Sensory textures (creaking ladders, cracking album) permeate the narrative. Atmosphere functions as an extension of the protagonist's fractured psyche.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visionary use of metaphor ("whispers into uneven stacks like broken constellations"), emotionally resonant ending, and thematic exploration of fragmentation-as-identity elevate the piece. Over-reliance on some abstracted phrases slightly dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Language avoids formulaic patterning; metaphors are consistently earned. No generic descriptors; emotional nuance emerges through action. Style maintains consistent ethereal strangeness without devolving into affectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic rather than literal anchors, creating cohesive existential meditation. Experiments risk alienating readers seeking logical cohesion, but intentional ambiguity feels purposeful rather than arbitrary.</comment>
