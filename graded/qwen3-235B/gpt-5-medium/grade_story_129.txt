<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but remains largely internalized; symbolic actions align with traits but lack nuanced emotional depth beyond poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Abstract progression replaces traditional plot; atmospheric cohesion compensates for minimal narrative arc, but the 500-word limit leaves structural resolution ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with tactile details (rust, salt, static), though "hushed euphoria" clashes with somber motifs, creating tonal friction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dense metaphors and layered subtext elevate the craft; however, emotional impact may falter without clear character investment beyond lyrical immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "listening machine," "torpedoing myths"); avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into self-indulgent abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>High cohesion in using elements to serve theme; the poetic brevity enhances rather than limits, leaving resonant thematic questions unresolved.</comment>
