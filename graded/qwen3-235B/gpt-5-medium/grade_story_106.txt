<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character has poignant symbolism but lacks emotional depth in inner conflict; motivations are implied through poetic gestures but feel abstract rather than organically earned through concrete behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum exists but relies on abstract poetic logic rather than causal chain of events; structural transitions often feel intuitive rather than rigorously engineered within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radiant sensory precision creates haunting pressure-chamber atmosphere; every mechanical and organic detail collaborates to make submerged decay palpably operatic through tactile descriptions of rust, citrus oils, algae.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Profound thematic layering through metaphor (quilting as both emotional survival and literal electrification); the lemon zest and stamp-singing transcend gimmickry through meticulous symbolic consistency; ending resonates with mythic minimalism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Evasive thesaurus-free diction; metaphors are freshly minted (e.g. "meter readouts looked like weather") rather than secondhand; emotional texture emerges subtextually through concrete actions rather than stated; no AI-generated rhythmic stutters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements fuse into haunting allegory where the setting becomes ideology; brevity weaponizes poetic compression; the story's DNA remains intact without element shuffling; leaves conceptual residue that transcends the scenario.</comment>
