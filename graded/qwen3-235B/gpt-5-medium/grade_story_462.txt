<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character exists primarily as a vessel for introspection; traits are implied through metaphor rather than action. Motivation to escape mental confinement is clear but not tested through dynamic choices. Dialogue absence weakens voice development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear progression through a static space substitutes for plot. Resolution feels more like thematic culmination than narrative movement. Pacing aligns with meditative tone but lacks tension-release cycles to sustain forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The setting's sensory textures (salt fog, fractured mirrors) create a haunting atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's fragmented psyche. Timeframe hush and coastal decay merge to enhance emotional resonance through environmental metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Radiant imagery clusters and paradoxical phrasing create strong thematic cohesion. The stained glass light-as-fertilization metaphor and infinite mirrors as psychological mirrors offer layered meaning. Ending lingers powerfully in the reader's mind.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten phrases ("trickster tongues", "ribcage of joy") flirt with purple prose but mostly serve the story's ethereal texture. Emotional depth arises through crafted metaphor clusters rather than direct statement, avoiding AI-like directness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic architecture rather than contrived checklist. Some moments (gull startling, metal sign) strain slightly to earn their place. The brevity works as an intentional poetic form rather than constraint.</comment>
