<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to outshine their reflection is present but abstract, lacking emotional depth or relatable internal conflict; voice is evocative but more stylistic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression toward demolition, but momentum relies on fragmented poetic imagery rather than cause-effect relationships or tangible stakes; structure feels impressionistic, not plot-driven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details (rust taste, probabilistic tides) create immersive atmosphere; setting amplifies existential themes, though real-world logic gaps exist.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "absence rooting teeth") and recursive identity motifs offer thematic depth; ending's "newly invented silence" resonates, but emotional impact is diffused by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Radical originality in blending quantum decay with mythic ritual; avoids genre tropes, though some phrases risk self-indulgence ("dissolved, outshone" feels overly neat).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a singular surreal vision, though cohesion hinges on tone more than narrative logic; lingers as an aesthetic experience rather than an emotionally resonant one.</comment>
