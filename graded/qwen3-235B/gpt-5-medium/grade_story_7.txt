<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character exists as abstract concept; "expectantly resigned" manifests in passive tone but lacks psychological depth or evolution. Voice is lyrical but detached, with doll interactions serving symbolism over character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Narrative follows ethereal "journey" structure with star paths as loose plot engine, but lacks stakes or emotional payoff. Pacing lingers on imagery at expense of forward momentum, creating static quality despite lyrical progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral sensory world-building through nectar's "sweetness," honeycombed custodians, and "amber corridors" creates immersive atmosphere. Surreal setting and mythic timeframe harmonize with tone, though coherence between setting mechanics and metaphors remains ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("stars decanted from sorrow," "ethereal grit") elevate craft, but emotional resonance remains elusive. Theme of boundary-crossing persistence emerges clearly, though existential questions about mortality/prayer feel underdeveloped beneath lush surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original use of dolls as "witnesses" distinguishes from tropes, but excessive adjectives ("threadbare hymn," "constellations decanted") risk ornate abstraction. Subtext about healing through fragmented repair shines, though overall structure occasionally lapses into poetic rhythm over narrative necessity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ethereal beauty sustains interest, but cohesion suffers from prioritizing lyrical cadence over clarifying narrative function. Brief length amplifies poetic impact while accentuating lack of traditional resolution or character engagement.</comment>
