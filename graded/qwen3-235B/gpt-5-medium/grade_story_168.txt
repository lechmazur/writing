<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivations and traits (ruthlessness, spontaneity) are illustrated through symbolic actions and metaphors but lack psychological depth; the "watcher" perspective privileges atmosphere over interiority, leaving motivations feeling more implied than fully inhabited.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc of discovery and revelation, but the central action of decoding rock art remains abstract; the stone circle’s transformation into a map feels narratively satisfying yet strains plausibility; pacing balances lyrical description with forward movement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (lichen, wildflowers, gorse) and the moor’s liminality create immersion; the twilight setting and interplay between music and silence amplify tension; atmosphere consistently reinforces themes of transience and careful intrusion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric parallels between floral arranging/rock art and anarchy/care elevate the narrative; the ending’s resonant gesture (comb as “courteous key”) and the watcher’s duty to “share burdens” imply deeper themes, though emotional impact is tempered by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in linking flower arranging to archaeology and anarchy to ritual stands out; some phrasing (“mind skipping like a pebble”) skirts cliché; tone avoids overt sentimentality but occasionally leans on lyrical excess; subtext about impermanence feels purposeful rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</comment<grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but feel curated for symbolic weight rather than organic integration; the story’s poetic density suits its brevity but risks feeling more like a mood piece than a fully realized narrative; thematic ambition exceeds emotional payoff.</comment>
