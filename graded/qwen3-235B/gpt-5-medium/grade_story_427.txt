<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's mechanical arm as both weapon and philosophical tool is conceptually rich, but motivations around "weaver of dreams" remain abstract. Dialogue is sparse but hints at moral complexity, though the protagonist's psychological evolution feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plotted like a chamber play with philosophical debate as the driving force. The lighthouse's symbolic function and limited action create a tight arc, but the resolution's metaphysical implications arrive abruptly within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse's decayed grandeur—salt-crusted stones, immobilized prism, storm-haunted architecture—creates an oppressive yet luminous setting that mirrors the thematic tensions between truth and stability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphysical language ("shifting equilibria," "pressure we owe the drowned") elevates the concept, while the mechanical arm's ethics-driven hum and sock symbolism create visceral resonance. The ending's lyrical ambiguity could benefit from sharper emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose exhibits originality in metaphors and conceptual fusion (philosophy as swordplay) but occasionally risks opacity through over-incantation. Emotions emerge through abstraction rather than sensory revelation, which may distance readers despite its stylistic daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere through poetic logic rather than plot mechanics—every detail serves either atmosphere or the central dialectic. The brevity feels intentional, compressing ideas into a haunting, debate-igniting whole.</comment>
