<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's jumpy nature is thematically consistent but under-explored beyond surface-level reactions; motivation to unmask the Paladin is clear, but introspective depth is sacrificed to poetic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Logical progression of events exists, but pacing feels fragmented in places; resolution is conceptually satisfying but emotionally underdeveloped due to brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and idiosyncratic, with sensory details that crystallize the video game liminality; tone and setting synthesize admirably.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resonantly original premise undercut by occasionally overwritten prose; some phrases ("forever jumpy at loading screens") shimmer with freshness, while others feel strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Technical cohesion and thematic ambition outweigh structural modesty; a thought-provoking meditation on systemic abuse within digital mythology.</comment>
