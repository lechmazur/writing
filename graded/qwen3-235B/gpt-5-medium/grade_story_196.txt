<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's duality as "tired swordsman" is poetically rendered but psychological motivations lack granular specificity; the hidden promise feels more like a thematic conceit than organically developed drive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Internal arc of apathy-to-awareness maintains coherence through symbolic progression rather than external plot, but structural tension between resignation and reinvention remains diffused despite lyrical momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush, dissonant imagery (kettles as "distant hearts," meteors as "silver river paths") creates palpable atmosphere where spiritual gravity contradicts physical laws with mythic authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite linguistic precision elevates abstract introspection into visceral metaphor; "locked door remembering rain" and sword as burden/pilgrimage device exemplify literary craft that turns metaphysical inquiry into emotional experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten similes ("like river paths for those who dislike roads") border on mannerism, yet inventive metaphors (apron as "resignation speech made from cotton") mostly transcend convention with idiosyncratic authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragments into cohesive whole through atmospheric continuity but struggles to fully transcend poetic vignette status into fully realized narrative, though the paradoxical ethos of "fiercely apathetic" perseverance lingers memorably.</comment>
