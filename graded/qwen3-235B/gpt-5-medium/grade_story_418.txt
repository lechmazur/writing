<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Personality shaped by "headstrong" trait is clear, but internal conflict between bitterness and vulnerability lacks sufficient dramatization through actions. Motivation to "bring color back" feels consistent yet under-explored through experiential moments rather than abstract statements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Parsimonious structure uses the "sparkling costume" residue as effective plot conduit, but the confession's emotional pay-off relies on vague gestures ("trees rattle like jurors"). Resolution feels abrupt despite strong circular framing with the record player.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking juxtaposition of radioactive decay and fragile growth is maintained, but sensory immersion inconsistent - "feminized" storms and "curtsy-shaped" dust lack tactile specificity. Setting occasionally prioritizes atmospheric excess over functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional control of metaphor ("orchard dares remember spectrum") and subtextual exploration of performative identity vs. authentic repentance. Ending resonates with thematic weight without over-explanation. Emotional nuance conveyed through precise imagery rather than explication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Substantially avoids clich√© through original combinations (radioactive forgiveness, "laugh-stained" sapling). Language maintains precision without becoming florid. Subtle psychological complexity in self-deceiving artist's redemption through physical labor. No detectable AI-like patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exceptionally tight conceptual unity between artistic failure, ecological ruin, and regenerative apology. Narrative economy serves thematic potency. Some structural unevenness in confession payoff undermines perfect cohesion. Lingering conceptual resonance about impermanent redemption remains potent.</comment>
