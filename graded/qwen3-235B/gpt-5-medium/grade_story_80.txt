<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by introspective obsessions rather than tangible traits, making motivations feel philosophically consistent but emotionally distant; the first-person narration's poetic voice is compelling but lacks grounded vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Non-linear progression follows thematic logic rather than traditional plot mechanics; the erosion of time/confidence parallels structural fragmentation, creating coherence through metaphor even when narrative cause/effect remains deliberately ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (dust blooms, humming doorknobs, rusted rails) create a cohesive liminal space where decay and wonder coexist; atmospheric precision makes the surreal tangible.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (keys as answers, eroded truths, listening door) layer meaning without reducing to allegory; the ending's refusal to "solve" feels thematically courageous rather than evasive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through abstracted, mythic language; while some phrases flirt with floridity ("grammar of turns"), they serve thematic obsessions about meaning-making; emotional resonance emerges through imagery rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story prioritizes poetic cohesion over conventional structure; every element contributes to a unified mythos about unfinished truths, though its self-conscious lyricism may limit broader resonance.</comment>
