<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptualized smuggler persona lacks sufficient emotional investment; motivations remain abstract rather than visceral despite poetic descriptions of survival calculus. The core contradiction between logic/emotion remains more intellectual than narratively embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rapid pacing maintains urgency but sacrifices cause-effect clarity; the demolition countdown and tunnel mapping interlace effectively. However, the discovery of the shoe and subsequent revelation feels rushed rather than earned through concrete spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gothic-technocratic atmosphere masterfully rendered through olfactory/tactile details (jasmine clinging "like breath," lunar soil's cold abstraction). The whispering dome operates as sentient architecture, making the setting a living participant in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolic architecture (silence as map/weapon, keys measuring forgetting) elevates the text beyond plot mechanics. The paradox of mercy requiring auditing lingers disturbingly, though emotional engagement never transcends conceptual fascination.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some phrases ("perfume of elders who practiced silence as architecture") reach literary originality, while others ("dangerous confessions" of stone) risk metaphor fatigue. Avoids genre tropes but occasionally overindulges in ornamental abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully fused rather than checklisted - the countdown, key, and smuggling ethos create a coherent mytho-poetic system. The central tension between erasure and preservation resonates, though thematic weight occasionally overshadows character specificity.</comment>
