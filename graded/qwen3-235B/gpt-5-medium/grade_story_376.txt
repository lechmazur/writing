<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters remain impressionistic, defined by metaphor rather than psychology. The fortune teller’s motivations hinge on abstract archetype rather than personal logic. The narrator’s arc relies on poetic resonance over concrete decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic rhythm rather than traditional causality. The wine-tasting as narrative engine feels contrived, but the symbolic transformation in the ledger provides satisfying closure. Pacing lingers rather than advances.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s heartbeat. The reimagined longhouse merges historical specificity with timeless mystique; sensory details (seal fat, juniper wine) root the surrealism in tangible immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Language achieves lyric heft through metaphor (inkwell as “slow comet,” wind as “worried” roof). The archive-as-compass theme cuts deeper than surface narrative, though emotional impact leans on abstraction over visceral stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but risks poetic self-indulgence (“domestic orbit,” “navigable weather”). Emotion is sublimated through metaphor rather than stated. Some descriptors verge on aesthetic overload without thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around memory-as-legacy motif. The story transcends brevity through thematic density. The Viking gallery conceit demonstrates ingenuity, though some elements (wine tasting) strain plausibility to serve metaphor.</comment>
