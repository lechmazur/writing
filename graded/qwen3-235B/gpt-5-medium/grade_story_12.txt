<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some internal conflict shown but aloofness lacks sustained depth; shared paddle moment appears abruptly, motivations remain somewhat abstract despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Interconnected thread exists but causality between mapping and mall AI's reaction feels underdeveloped; pacing works but resolution arrives too suddenly without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, sensory-rich world-building with algorithmic fountains and submerged concrete domes strengthens thematic connections between memory and commercialism; atmosphere sustains tonal coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (cracked tile as both wound/path) and thematic cohesion shine, but introspective telling occasionally undermines 'showing' principles; ending resonates conceptually but lacks visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphoric layering (commerce as cartography), though occasional over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("river vowels") risks mannerism; maintains consistent lyrical style.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively with minimal friction, though brief length leaves thematic throughlines underexplored; poetic resonance present but requires reader patience.</comment>
