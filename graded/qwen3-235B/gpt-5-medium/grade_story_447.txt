<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and clear motivation (mending community through subversive recipes), but remains more symbolic than fully fleshed; actions align with traits but lack emotional depth and psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc from isolation to tentative reconciliation, but transitions between visions and outcomes feel slightly rushed; coherence maintained through recurring metaphors but lacks nuanced progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere impressively built through tactile cooking details and amber prison imagery, though societal decay remains abstract rather than deeply felt; tone balances melancholy and hope effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with strong symbolism (recipes as peace offers, singing as rupture repair); ending resonates thematically; occasionally veers toward over-written passages that dilute emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphorical logic distinguishes this from formulaic work; "news bulletins as steam" original; avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing; subtext about communal healing feels authentic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements integrate effectively (kitchen alchemy as community reparation), brief length feels purposeful, emotional undercurrent lingers through symbolic resolutions rather than explicit explanation.</comment>
