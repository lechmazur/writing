<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Singular voice and consistent rebellious motivation anchor this character; the fusion of obituarist craft with character actions creates a compelling tension between life, death, and authorship. The mask's reactions reveal nuanced emotional landscapes rather than simple traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Labyrinthine progression driven by organ-resonance manifestations creates organic structure; the revolution framing device and obituary-as-augury method maintain narrative cohesion despite compressed form. Pacing occasionally prioritizes poetic density over clarity in transitional moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Each sensory detail functions as thematic architecture: papercut air, chalk-etched margins, and porcelain tide create a synesthetic dreamscape where revolution buzzes in bookshelves. The setting breathes as living narrative force through consistently inventive environmental storytelling.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metatextual layering elevates storytelling impact: the mask-as-metronome device embodies the tension between fate and agency. The subversion of obituaries into navigational tools challenges narrative permanence with striking philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing through conceptual alchemyâ€”'marching light' obituaries, 'monsoon ink' breaths. Sensory details possess crystalline specificity, but the 'rebel cadence' resolution teeters on the edge of over-orchestrated symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements function as interdependent narrative organs rather than checklist items. The revolution framing device and cathedral-in-bookshelf concept demonstrate audacious interplay of scale/ambition. Leaves lingering existential weight about narrative's power to reshape reality.</comment>
