<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the necromancer's sincerity and meekness shape his gentle, ritualistic actions, his interiority remains underexplored, reducing him to an atmospheric device rather than a fully dimensional character. His motivation is clear but surface-level, lacking emotional conflict or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The circular structure—inhabiting the necromancer's daily practice—serves the theme but lacks narrative momentum. The core action of decoding the tapestry is logically consistent with the method, yet the resolution feels abrupt rather than earned, leaving the arc underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich, sensory details (copper hoops, market hum, ink-stained cobbles) fuse with the goblin setting to create a hauntingly tangible world. However, the playground timeframe remains loosely integrated, more implied atmosphere than active narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Stunning prose employs metaphor ("universal riddle," "shadows teach hands") to explore communication and reconciliation. The ending resonates thematically, though the lack of tension or conflict weakens emotional urgency despite vivid showing of character and theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Subverts necromancy tropes via humility; the broken nib and "tangled tapestry" feel original yet cohesive. Avoids flowery excess through precise imagery, though some descriptions ("politely restless") flirt with artificiality despite overall organic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Despite its brevity, the story cohesively wove all elements into a thematically rich narrative. The lyrical style serves its mystical tone, though the slight scale and lack of narrative friction limit broader emotional resonance.</comment>
