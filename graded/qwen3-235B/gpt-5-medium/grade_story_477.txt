<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character motivations remain abstract, blending poetic introspection with shallow action; the swordsman’s duality of artistry and purpose lacks visceral emotional grounding despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over structural clarity, resulting in abrupt escalations; the escape portal and vault resolution feel narratively unearned within the compressed arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater garden’s immersive, decaying splendor—kelp-transmitted rumors, corroded speakers—anchors the story’s haunting mood; some dissonant elements like “bird songs” slightly undermine plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (swordplay as orbital geometry, light as coded rebellion) create potent subtext, but the ending leans on poetic ambiguity rather than emotional resolution, diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Linguistic invention (“pixel algae,” “lanternfish-thoughts”) avoids cliche; the fusion of cybernetic and organic decay feels daring, though occasional overwrought lines flirt with abstraction-as-substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>High stylization dazzles but distances; conceptual cohesion exists, yet feels more like a prose poem than a narrative with stakes, lacking urgency beneath its aesthetic mastery.</comment>
