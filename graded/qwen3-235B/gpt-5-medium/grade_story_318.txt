<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's aloofness lacks grounding in tangible behavior; motivation remains abstract despite poetic gestures; reactions to the spoon reveal thematic connections but not psychological depth; voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot unfolds through metaphoric gestures rather than organic action; cause/effect between translating lullabies and plot progression is vague; episodic structure weakens cohesion despite lyrical flourishes; arc exists but feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally elusive worldbuilding; atmosphere prioritizes aesthetic mood over visceral engagement; crystal library and siege elements lack tangible textures; contrast between gloomy cheerfulness and mechanical siege is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors occasionally transcend pretension ("architecture of the mind reorganizes"); thematic resonance between past and present frays; ending feels more like stylistic flourish than earned resolution; subtext about mercy vs. machinery underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Prose wavers between originality and overwritten abstraction ("lantern lit for a storm that refuses to cancel the parade"); emotional beats are stated rather than demonstrated; structure avoids clich√©s but indulges in impressionistic vagueness that feels algorithmically curated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stylistic ambition outweighs emotional authenticity; elements function collectively but not individually indispensable; tone dominates over character/story; ending lingers but lacks narrative inevitability; poetic intensity compensates for structural looseness.</comment>
