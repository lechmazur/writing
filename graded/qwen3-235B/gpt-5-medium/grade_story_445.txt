<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters have distinct voices and contrasting philosophies but lack sufficient nuance in motivation alignment. The nomad’s passivity versus Mira’s determination are clear but under-explored; actions don’t fully reveal psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot has structural bookends but suffers from compressed pacing. The abrupt shift from the disguise room to the mountain conclave weakens emotional resonance; cause/effect between symbolic elements and plot progression remain hazy despite strong thematic intentions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges surreal and practical details effectively, but setting lacks concrete sensory grounding. The "secret agent disguise room" and "unseen bells" create intrigue without sufficient tactile context; tone balances whimsy and cynicism unevenly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Writing displays lyrical precision and layered metaphor (e.g. "river stones grinding under snowmelt"). Conflict between arrogance and humility resonates through symbolic objects; ending’s philosophical weight compensates for minor issues with narrative economy and subtextual richness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with inventive imagery ("throat-microphone sounding like river stones") but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing. Character psychology remains human enough but edges toward archetypal abstraction; emotional stakes feel inferred more than viscerally constructed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent but strained by ambitious scope. Assigned elements are mostly integral yet occasionally overshadowed by thematic prioritization; the concise length sacrifices character depth but accentuates metaphorical heft. Leaves lingering thematic questions without over-explaining.</comment>
