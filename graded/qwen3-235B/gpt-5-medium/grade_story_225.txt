<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (tracking butterflies as map-redrawers) and actions (brewing tinctures) remain abstract, with underdeveloped emotional stakes. The protagonist's internal logic feels more symbolic than human, lacking psychological complexity beneath lyrical surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes substitute for plot progression. Causal relationships (e.g., butterflies dictating paths, Morse code love) lack dramatic tension. The abrupt "we became a moving sanctuary" resolution feels unearned within the compressed structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush, tactile details create a cohesive steampunk maritime atmosphere of fragile beauty amid decay. Sensory elements (kelp-ash tinctures, pressure grooves on fogged glass, lanterns in rivets) amplify thematic contrasts between mechanical harshness and organic hope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterflies as "living maps," love as Morse code "lanterns") offer intellectual heft. Subtext about healing broken worlds through unconventional means resonates, though emotional engagement with characters remains secondary to lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre templates by fusing maritime grit with surreal biology (migratory butterflies with molt-based medicine). Some overwritten metaphors (e.g., "electricity wanted to applaud") teeter toward excess, but overall inventiveness elevates beyond formulaic steampunk tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High-concept elements coexist without full narrative integration: the butterflies' agency, treaty politics, and Morse code love feel loosely connected. The brevity enhances atmosphere but diminishes emotional payoff, leaving thematic impact stronger than structural cohesion.</comment>
