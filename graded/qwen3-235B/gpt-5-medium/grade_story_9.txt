<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations lack depth; actions driven more by surreal plot mechanisms than organic development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Non-linear plot maintains cohesion through vivid throughlines; pacing compresses but doesn't compromise arc; action logic leans on dreamlike symbolism over realism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with layered metaphors (puzzle box, shifting billboards) creates rich subtext about futility and transformation; ending crystallizes central conflict while maintaining enigmatic power.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality bursts from every image without relying on novelty; sarcasm cuts through surrealism to humanize abstract ideas; emotional nuance emerges through irony rather than explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</question><grade>The story transcends element清单 through alchemical fusion: each component becomes symbolic bedrock; demonstrates masterful integration where constraints amplify rather than stifle creativity.</comment>
