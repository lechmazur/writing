<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Very little of the conjurer’s inner life is revealed despite first-person implications. Motivations (justice, garden restoration) are stated rather than dramatized through specific choices or conflicts. Character functions as a vessel for theme rather than a fully embodied agent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from summons to resolution, but progression feels assembled rather than organic. Transitions between key moments (e.g., retrieving fragments, reversing messages) lack narrative weight. The tight word limit emphasizes style over sustained dramatic momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly evocative worldbuilding through tactile metaphors (“hammered dawn,” “coal-shine eyes,” “brass moon”). Sensory details immerse and reflect thematic tensions, though the dwarves’ culture remains abstract. Atmosphere elevates the story’s thematic ambitions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic machinery (butterfly as cartography of mercy, reversed speech as truth-revealing ritual) creates layered resonance. The ending delivers catharsis through subverting expectations of justice. Some emotional impact diluted by heavily stylized prose that occasionally obscures human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Richly inventive metaphors (“petals made of bells,” “debt owed to wind”) avoid genre clichés, but lyrical excesses occasionally read as mannered. Character psychology leans on abstraction over nuanced interiority, and some phrasing (“trembling that did not flee”) risks poetic redundancy without deepening meaning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story synthesizes all required elements into a cohesive thematic framework. The brevity feels purposeful, using compression to amplify metaphorical density. Raises questions about justice as collective memory recovery, leaving a lingering resonance beyond the final image of cultivated dawn.</comment>
