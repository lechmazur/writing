<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Bard's motivation is poetic but occasionally vague; actions align with "elegantly disheveled" aesthetic but psychological depth feels implied rather than developed through concrete choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meandering progression gains momentum through sensory set-pieces; cause/effect between stove overload and emotional resolution forms spine, but the threadbare narrative arc relies heavily on lyrical abstraction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory alchemy creates immersive atmosphere - the airship's creaks, burnt spices' electricity, and twilight's temporal liminality form a cohesive dreamscape where wonder-as-mechanical-metaphor thrives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly original metaphor scaffolding elevates; "crumbs of song seeding swings" and stove-as-thunder-metaphor showcase potent subtext; theme of mechanical wonder as resistance against calculated conformity resonates beneath surface lyricism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines through airship-as-playground surrealism, though occasional adverbial tics ("measured breath with ruler") and mannered descriptions border on preciousness; emotional nuance emerges through symbolic action rather than stated feelings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements interweave through poetic metaphor more than narrative necessity - the ruler works as multifunctional symbol, but some components (playground twilight, family of swifts) risk becoming ornamental rather than structural.</comment>
