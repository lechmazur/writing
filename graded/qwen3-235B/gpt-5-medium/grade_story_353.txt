<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait of 'cynically gentle' is well-established through voice and symbolic actions, but deeper emotional layers of the tyrant's origins are underexplored, weakening character dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc, but time-travel mechanics and stakes lack concrete explanation; the sudden resolution feels narratively expedient rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (ozone, ginger smells, lunar phases) create immersive, mythic atmosphere; the juxtaposition of baking with time travel enhances thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor and symbolic logic elevates the narrative; the substitution of "listening" for "contagion" is emotionally resonant, though the ending could deepen its thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through poetic syncretism (baking/time travel), though some phrases ("humming ribs") risk conceptual abstraction without sufficient emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively, but the compressed format occasionally strains narrative logic; the fusion of personal and political resistance offers thought-provoking subtext.</comment>
