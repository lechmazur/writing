<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation leans into abstraction but lacks concrete emotional grounding; Clover's role as guide feels somewhat underexplored despite its thematic significance to "tending" and "apathy."</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves through atmospheric vignettes rather than narrative logic; coherence exists, but the arc resists traditional structure, undermining tension between purpose and futility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and haunting, with rich sensory textures; however, setting occasionally prioritizes aesthetic over thematic integration (e.g., drive-in's symbolic role feels underutilized).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose employs startling, original metaphors ("sugar-fleshed fruit rotting at the core of a town") that elevate thematic resonance; ending circles back with quiet poignancy, showing rather than stating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Virtually no clich√©s or formulaic patterns; language occasionally risks becoming self-parodic with ornate descriptors ("sugar-fleshed fruit rotting at the core of a town"), but original imagery predominates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Heteroglossic elements feel deliberately woven rather than forced; however, the abstract tone and elliptical themes work at cross-purposes with the drive toward narrative cohesion.</comment>
