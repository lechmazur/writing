<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but character remains abstract, defined more through symbolic gestures than psychological depth or emotional nuance. "Earnestness" manifests as duty but lacks interiority or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but static; the journey serves as a lyrical meditation rather than a dynamic arc. Resolution feels predetermined, with minimal conflict or transformation despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create a vividly parched, haunted desert and icy northern contrast. Atmosphere occasionally borders on overly elaborate description but generally amplifies the knight’s quest and emotional undertones.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful literary craft: metaphors (e.g., “astronomical map smelling of salt,” “fire as memory engineering”) resonate thematically. Ending ties visceral action to universal stakes through poetic resonance and layered subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avant-garde style avoids cliché but risks ornate abstraction (e.g., “lizards blinked like terse priests”). Backstory via greenhouse tears is original, though some phrases lean into aestheticized vagueness over human-scale emotionality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Highly cohesive but occasionally self-indulgent in descriptive density. Assigned elements are skillfully woven into a singular vision, though the story’s length prioritizes lyricism over narrative tension.</comment>
