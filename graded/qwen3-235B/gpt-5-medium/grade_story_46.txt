<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Characters exist as abstract symbols rather than beings with psychological dimensionality; motivations expressed through cryptic dialogue lack emotional grounding or causal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Surreal incidents replace coherent plot progression; the narrative drifts through poetic imagery without stakes, stakes-altering choices, or clear transformation across the artificial "arc."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Evocative but self-indulgent description overloads the setting; atmospheric elements rarely interact meaningfully with character actions or thematic concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric density and rhythmic prose create lingering resonance; however, the absence of emotional specificity limits full transcendence despite technical mastery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality evident in surreal conceits and linguistic daring, but frequently veers into mannered excess; some imagery risks obscuring rather than enhancing thematic intent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</question><comment>Formal cohesion exists at the sentence level, but imposed "elements" often compete rather than synthesize; succeeds as mood study but struggles with narrative purpose.</comment>
