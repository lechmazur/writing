<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's arc from jaded cynic to purposeful collaborator is conceptually strong, but lacks depth in emotional transitions; motivations shift from personal detachment to mythic duty without sufficient psychological groundwork.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nonlinear plot works thematically but sacrifices narrative momentum; key scenes (e.g., throne's disappearance) lack structural payoff; resolution feels more poetic than satisfying. Subtle coherence losses in rooftop navigation sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting functions as living entity through synesthetic details - chimneys as sentinels, quince alleys, sap-lye scent trail. Atmospheric unity achieved through metaphor cluster of locked/ajar doors mirroring orchard's living architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subtext about power as process (not possession) resonates through ritualized actions; kiln heat vs. vine-bound throne creates thematic tension; some lyrical passages risk overshadowing character stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in inverted hero's journey structure; avoids clich√© by making ritualistic preservation the goal. Prose occasionally succumbs to baroque excess ("demure audacity" works, "frost traced in sugar" borders on arch).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite eclectic elements, though feels curated rather than discovered; thematic unity maintained but emotional accessibility suffers in translation from poetic language to human experience.</comment>
