<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's desperation drives action but remains surface-level; voice is poetic yet underdeveloped, blending surrealism with emotional distance that dilutes investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on surreal logic over traditional structure; cause-effect relationships feel dreamlike but occasionally arbitrary. Pacing maintains tension within tight constraints, though resolution feels condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Suburban decay and industrial grotesquerie contrast effectively; rich sensory details immerse, but some metaphors (e.g., tar lattices as kinship) strain for symbolic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story thrums with layered metaphors (alchemy as reconciliation, kinship as alchemy). Ending transcends plot through thematic resonance, though emotional payoff is understated rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in fusing domesticity with occult machinery; avoids genre tropes through fragmented surrealism. Occasional ornate phrasing ("barbed thread") risks abstraction fatigue but mostly enhances mythic tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a haunting whole; brevity feels intentional. Lingering questions about legacy and reconciliation imply thematic depth without dogma. Minor tonal shifts (e.g., careworn rituals to revelation) feel earned.</comment>
