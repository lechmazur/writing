<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters hint at depth but lack detailed motivation; Ivo’s actions are compellingly paradoxical yet under-explained, while the narrator remains secondary, serving thematic function over individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plots cohere around the phial’s subversion, with a clear arc from rebellion to defiance; some pacing inconsistencies (cave sequence feels abrupt) within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal, cohesive atmosphere via tidal rhythms, sensory details (rotted banners, brackish water), and setting’s symbiosis with themes of cyclical tradition and transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., “gray of the tide”) and resonant themes of agency vs. determinism are subtly conveyed; emotional restraint allows thematic depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, original imagery avoids cliché; emotional nuance is shown, not told, though the rebellion motif is structurally familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Economical use of assigned elements; some feel more foundational (phial, island) than others, but the narrative’s cohesion and lingering thematic ambiguity earn strong marks.</comment>
