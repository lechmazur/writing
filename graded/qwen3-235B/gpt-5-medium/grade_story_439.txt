<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is intriguingly defined by contradictions (mute yet expressive, bold yet unassuming), but motivation remains opaque despite hints. The parcels-as-decoys revelation feels underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints; transitions are seamless despite limited word count. Resolution feels inevitable but slightly rushed - the epiphany about "routes as feelings" could be more earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and elemental - salt/dust/snow create tactile reality. Sensory precision elevates the haunting decay of the opera house into a character itself through crumbling ceilings and musical resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose sings with startlingly original metaphors ("deep fishes" for lights) that deepen meaning. Ending resonates with emotional truth about silent communication between realms, transcending its conceit through lyrical economy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evasion of clich√©s is impressive - focuses on sensory specificity over abstraction. Some purple-prose tendencies exist ("shuddering enchantment") but justified by narrative voice. Subverts courier trope into metaphysical delivery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements feel organically entangled rather than arbitrarily connected. Makes the impossible feel inevitable through atmospheric logic. Leaves readers with haunting questions about the nature of passage between realities.</comment>
