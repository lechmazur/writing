<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The character's dry wit surfaces in phrases like "dry-witted custodian of oaths" but remains more symbolic than deeply explored. Motivation to learn traditional methods is clear, but inner conflict and nuance are underdeveloped; actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pacing manages a circular, ritualistic structure within constraints, but the plot lacks traditional cause-and-effect progression. The rope's role drives the narrative, yet thematic abstraction muddles resolution; coherence leans on poetic association over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion: "wardrobe breathes," "salt-prayer," "anchor tattoo that lies" forge visceral connections between atmosphere and theme. The haunted lighthouse's claustrophobic decay mirrors eroding promises, enhancing both character and concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors and layered symbolism ("tarantella of interrogation," "tenderness without truth...harbor for storms") craft a haunting, thought-provoking tone. Emotional impact is subdued in favor of intellectual resonance, but subtext about truth's cost is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in inventive metaphors and the dance-as-interrogation motif. Avoids clich√©s through specificity ("salt-prayer," "rope knots as calendar"), though some phrasing ("bleach away," "ledger pages curl") risks abstraction over immersion. Style feels cohesive, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Synthesizes assigned elements into a thematically unified piece with deliberate ambiguity. Structure serves mood, and language elevates. Not all components (e.g., dance motif) achieve full resonance, but the story lingers as a meditation on integrity and decay.</comment>
