<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters lack interiority and emotional depth despite vivid descriptions; motivations feel poetic but insufficiently rooted in human relatability, relying on metaphor over psychological verisimilitude.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Non-linear structure prioritizes tone over plot momentum; coherence emerges through atmospheric continuity rather than narrative causality, leaving some connections feeling arbitrary despite the confined arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immersive, sensorially rich world-building with tactile contrasts (solder/tea, breathing scaffolds) creates haunting, layered atmosphere where setting becomes character; tone masterfully balances mechanical and organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors operate as thematic scaffolding (myths-as-error-correction, telescopes-as-listening-glasses), with subtext about memory/creation unfolding through controlled lyricism; ending resonates intellectually while maintaining narrative restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through inventive mashups (e.g., machine birth myths, industrial lullabies); some phrases verge on ornate but mostly serve conceptual weight; rhythmically organic rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified thematic meditation on memory/touch; brevity enhances the ethereal quality; risks abstraction over clarity but succeeds through tonal precision and imagistic cohesion.</comment>
