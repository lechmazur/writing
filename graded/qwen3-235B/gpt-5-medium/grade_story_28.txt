<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits as a "sly agent" lack depth; motivations are implied but inconsistently fleshed out. The first-person voice is distinct but underdeveloped, offering glimpses of personality without emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses through specific actions (fork bridging generator, testimony recording) but feels rushed in its abrupt shifts (e.g., neighbors arriving). Cause-effect logic holds, but the compact structure leaves moments underelaborated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (ozone, broken plexiglass) and mythic references (thunder soup, moon’s debt) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere that deepens the story’s themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical language and symbolic actions (fork sparking, bumper cars humming) elevate the narrative. The ending resonates thematically but leans on poetic abstraction over emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in folklore integration (walnuts splitting in winter births) and fresh metaphors. Avoids clichés, though some phrases (“desperate optimism”) verge on thematic overstatement. Tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is uneven; elements like the family tradition of volunteering feel tacked on. The brevity works for urgency but weakens character and thematic resolution.</comment>
