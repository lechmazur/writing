<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's "eagerly jaded" contradiction lacks sufficient emotional grounding, but their voice as a narrator is sharply rendered through poetic detachment. Motivation to "reframe terror" feels secondary to atmospheric concerns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves with internal logic through riddle-solving, but the auditions framework compresses progression too abruptly. The ending's transformation feels earned, though pacing issues emerge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details ("coughs of the ghost light," "thunder in the hush") create a tactile atmosphere where silence becomes its own character, perfectly entwining setting with plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate as both visceral and intellectual, particularly the dying man's "curtain line" death. The graceless laugh as transcendence lingers emotionally while maintaining lyrical ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in glove-as-hearing-device conceit and voice notes as confessional artifacts. Some phrases ("knuckles blooming like bruises") risk becoming standalone flourishes without thematic anchoring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong cohesion between elements, particularly sanctuary's silence clashing with transformative sound. The ending's thematic weight occasionally outpaces the character development needed to support it.</comment>
