<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains static, defined more by poetic posture than emotional or psychological depth; motivations (oath-keeping) are present but obscured by abstraction, with reactions to objects (fan, VR encounters) feeling symbolic rather than humanely specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but lacks narrative urgency; VR interactions don't organically propel the story toward adjudication of parallel worlds. Resolution feels thematically earned yet narratively abrupt, with underdeveloped cause-effect between elements like the fan's discovery and final verdict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Radiant sensory imagery (settling dust, murmuring stone) creates tangible atmosphere; the fossilized giant's carcass as setting is viscerally rendered. However, VR realm dilutes cohesion between physical and virtual spaces, weakening atmospheric unity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose soars with haunting, original metaphors ("straw casts shadows, bones store thunder") and philosophical tension between duty and emptiness; subtext about reconciliation through shared historical guilt is layered. Emotional beats are shown through symbolic action rather than stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with the scarecrow jurist concept; VR encounters slightly echo algorithmic patterns but anchor the existential themes. Some phrases verge on ornate abstraction ("principled emptiness"), but the voice remains distinctly human in its paradoxical yearning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like VR and the fan interlock thematically but feel narratively disconnected. The brevity works for poetic resonance but leaves structural gaps. The final image is memorable, suggesting deeper questions about justice beyond the plot itself.</comment>
