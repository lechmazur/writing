<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character voice is evocative but lacks consistent psychological depth; the sentinel trope remains superficial rather than shaping decisions or creating tension through conflicting duty/fear</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progresses through poetic images rather than narrative momentum; the tapestry decoding functions as conceptual throughline but lacks concrete stakes or payoff within word limit</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Breathless sensory economy creates oppressive atmosphere; chalk/fennel/chalky ruler details make abstract concepts tactile; spatial descriptions anchor metaphysical themes</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves haunting lyrical precision; metaphors (trembling as sensorium, walk as initiation) resonate beyond literal interpretation; ending earns thematic weight through accumulated imagery</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original conceit avoids genre traps but occasionally lapses into self-consciously poetic diction; some phrases ("gray muzzle," "harbor where fears moor") border on preciousness yet mostly serve symbolic architecture</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock with deliberate obsessiveness; the leash/dog functions as both character anchor and thematic device; poetic compression feels intentional rather than restrictive; certain surreal transitions strain cohesion</comment>
