<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character attributes are present but remain abstract; actions and motivations are poetic but lack psychological depth or conflict. The "detached swordsman" never fully transcends metaphor to become a relatable agent of concrete stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure adheres to the constraint but feels more like a meditation than a narrative arc. The vow’s consecration lacks tangible resolution, creating a static conclusion that prioritizes mood over progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked through sensory details (ozone hush, hum of bins), but the setting’s futuristic elements remain decorative rather than integral to the protagonist’s choices. The recycling center’s symbolic weight overshadows its functional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling excels in lyrical precision; metaphors resonate thematically (e.g., "sword’s shadow as a mooring line"). However, the emphasis on abstraction risks overshadowing emotional immediacy, leaning too heavily on poetic density.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept synthesis (weaving futures from trash, "patient blade"), but occasional phrases border on AI-era clichés ("secret weavers," "collage scraps"). Nuance in emotional motivation is implied rather than felt, leaning on poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The story coherently integrates assigned elements but feels more like a stylistic exercise than a narrative with urgent stakes. Its ambition in theme and language is evident, though the lack of narrative drive limits broader market appeal.</comment>
