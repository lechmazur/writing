<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation to collect fading games is clear, but character remains more symbolic than deeply human. Actions align with stated traits, yet "lazily ambitious" never fully materializes beyond surface descriptors. The unmasked face as trust-building device lacks emotional consequence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc—acquiring the drill, reigniting traditions, countering developers—but feels rushed in key transitions (e.g., bylaw harmonization resolving conflict). The conceptual core drives progression, though mechanical causality between elements feels occasionally convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with fountains as active memory-keepers and rain-as-temporal-metronome. Sensory details (chalk dust swirls, phantom game sounds) enrich the setting, though some abstractions (the city "coughing" memories) border on metaphorical excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and purposeful, with striking imagery (marbles clicking in gutters, fountains as forgotten laughter). The theme of cultural preservation through play resonates beyond the surface, enhanced by the vigilante’s rejection of sterile modernity. Subtext about oral tradition and resistance is potent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending vigilante tropes with anthropological salvage. The dentist’s drill as rules-keeper avoids cliché, and "laughter as victory" subverts expected game mechanics. No formulaic beats, though some phrases ("echoing beneath shuttered arcades") flirt with overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Assignments are tightly woven into the narrative, but the story occasionally prioritizes poetic interludes over plot momentum. The vigilante’s lack of personal stakes creates distance, though the closing lines leave a resonant meditation on communal memory.</comment>
