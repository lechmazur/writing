<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's gambler persona shapes their fatalistic acceptance of unpredictability, but interiority feels stylized over psychologically deep; emotional stakes with Mira lack sufficient buildup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm climax ties to opening motifs effectively, with tight 500-word architecture, though the professors' political lectures feel tacked onto the emotional arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral maritime imagery ("tallow in candle mold's ribs," "surge meters humming") creates an immersive, storm-haunted world where the setting functions as active character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-heavy prose risks obfuscation but redeems itself with striking synesthetic symbolism; the bargains-as-erosion conceit and final choice-to-collaborate-with-the-sea conclusion offer thematic heft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some overwritten passages verge on purple prose ("laughing tears that taste like batteries"), but the marine-philosophy hybrid voice feels distinct; emotional progression occasionally "tells" through descriptors rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements interwoven with intent (storm as narrative device, candle mold as metaphor), though the professors' "midnight lectures" read like thematic sledgehammers rather than organic influences.</comment>
