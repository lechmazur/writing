<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivation feels imposed rather than earned through action. "Skittish" trait lacks concrete manifestation in behavior or dialogue. Subconscious exploration is abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot maintains internal logic within constraints, with clear narrative arc from hair salon to command center. Connection between woven threads and subconscious navigation is conceptually sound but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere falters between lunar colony's technical demands and barbershop's poetic hush. Sensory details like settling hair/regolith are evocative but inconsistently applied across dual environments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (looms, micrometeorite maps) create haunting subtext about unconscious competence. Ending achieves emotional resonance through understated repair imagery. Some abstractions weaken payoff.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but contains mechanical transitions and formal phrasing ("dramatically understated" mannerisms). Ballet shoes and signal loom offer originality, yet certain turns of phrase ("fence mended with the exact right knot") feel formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds as atmospheric sketch but struggles to balance poetic abstraction with narrative cohesion. Assigned elements cohere conceptually but lack thematic interdependence.</comment>
