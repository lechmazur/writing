<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Character’s telepathy and immobility are intrinsic to his role as silent observer, with motivation flawlessly tied to his existence. His tragic joy and reaction to the hair tie reveal layered vulnerability and resolve, though subtler psychological complexity occasionally eludes him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot’s action (mental espionage via pigeons) drives momentum, but the parade climax feels compressed. Logical cause-effect links hold, though the timeframe’s breadth strains the story’s ability to fully resolve every thread within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, clashing sensory details (coal smoke sunrise, drumming steam pipes) and the fusion of mechanical grit with human decay immerse readers. The setting doesn’t merely serve as backdrop but actively shapes the plot’s mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., “brass in a tea cup”) and recurring motifs (“weatherized” truth) resonate deeply. The ending’s weeping statue and “music box” cheer are hauntingly resonant, with themes of silent justice and delayed accountability woven throughout.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the statue’s non-human perspective and the calligraphy-as-communion method. While some phrases flirt with ornate abstraction (“weatherized archives”), emotional nuance (the girl’s “cracked bell” mind) and thematic innovation elevate the story above formulaic structures.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The story’s interlocking elements create a unified, metaphor-rich whole. Its brevity feels purposeful, with lingering questions about collective truth-seeking and institutional rot that transcend the immediate narrative.</comment>
