<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arvo’s paradoxical blend of fear and hope is conceptually rich but remains underexplored; his motivations are implied rather than dramatized, relying on poetic abstraction over tangible character interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure subverts the word limit, but the resolution—while poetically resonant—skims the surface of narrative payoff; transitions (e.g., neighbors emerging) lack grounding in cause/effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with taut, original metaphors (“moth wings brushing iron fences,” “sirens stitched the distance”) that fuse setting and theme without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Poignant subtext about resistance as vulnerability; the final image of the city “breathing back” is haunting, and the fusion of tenderness and rebellion feels fresh and emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés, but occasional phrases (“deferred rain and stored argument”) border on overwrought; emotional stakes are shown through action, though subtle shifts in tone risk feeling artificially curated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dense with meaning and lyrical cohesion; the story’s brevity amplifies its strengths but occasionally sacrifices the organic unfolding of thematic tensions (indifference vs. rebellion).</comment>
