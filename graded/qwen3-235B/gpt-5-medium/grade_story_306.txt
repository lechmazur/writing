<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations (to connect fame's cost to sensory rituals) are poetically stated but not dramatized through concrete actions or psychological realism; interior life remains abstract despite compelling imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative momentum stalls in tangential fragments (paparazzi saints, bubblegum hair spray) rather than linear progression; circular logic between map's X and chamber setting complicates closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic fusion of neon-lit saints, vibrating steel tables, and calibrated silence creates a surreal but immersive liminal space; sensory motifs consistently reinforce emotional dissonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (applause as currency, treasure maps as healing) and recursive structure deliver cumulative emotional weight; occasional line-level abstraction weakens narrative cohesion but conceptually reinforces "wild magic" theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality evident in alchemical blend of scientific/mechanical and spiritual elements; some phrases ("zoo of sitcom childhood") risk mannerism, but overall avoids AI-style formula through persistent paradoxical juxtapositions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements integrate tightly with central metaphor but prioritize poetic resonance over narrative efficiency; thematic repetition feels intentional rather than structural flaw, though plot mechanics remain vaporous.</comment>
