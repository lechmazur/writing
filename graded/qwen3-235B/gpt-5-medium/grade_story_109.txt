<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct voice and coldness as an integrated trait; motivations (collecting remedies, lawful rebellion) are clear. Emotional reserve occasionally feels underexplored despite compelling actions like tactile altar engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Coherent arc from mitten retrieval to archive creation, but some cause-effect transitions (e.g., officer’s sudden blessing) feel compressed. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Haunting sensory layering (woodsmoke/ink/scorched steel) creates vivid worldbuilding; the secret agent center’s asceticism vs. altars’ rawness sharpens thematic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (remedies as "kitchen bravery") and layered subtext (archival healing as political act) elevate impact. Ending balances warmth with restraint for emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unexpected juxtaposition (bureaucratic secrecy + folk magic). Nuanced emotion shown via tactile details (mittens as "flags") rather than exposition. Language is purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements synergize around duality (law/chaos, cold/heart). The brevity focuses on thematic beats, sacrificing some plot resolution for emotional truth. Lingering questions about systemic change remain unresolved but purposeful.</comment>
