<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character psychology remains abstract; "impassive" trait functions more as poetic motif than deep characterization. Motivation feels thematic rather than personally felt, though the deputy's relationship to maintenance-as-witnessing offers intriguing contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rescuing the queen bee provides narrative spine, but the poetic tone undermines strict cause-effect progression. Pacing works within lyrical constraints - the oil change bookends create structural symmetry, though plot momentum remains atmospheric rather than event-driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dripping chandeliers, baptistery's metal shop, and orchard spanning stained glass create tactile religiosity merged with mechanics. Sensory details blend automotive oil/scent with honeycomb/blossom air; the cathedral's exhale at conclusion provides perfect atmospheric resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphor chains (bees as bureaucracy, engines as prayer) operate with subtlety. The "steadiness people trust" line crystallizes theme of service-as-worship. Ending evokes transcendence through maintenance rather than despite it, with mechanical/spiritual harmonics beautifully sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© in merging spirituality with machinery rather than opposing them. The "cathedrals have mileage logs" concept fresh, though some phrases like "soft survivable thunder" edge toward preciousness. Maintains tonal consistency better than most surreal pieces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Successfully weaves multiple assigned elements into a seamless dream-logic narrative, though thematic cohesion occasionally strains under symbolic weight. Story's concision works both for and against it - gains poetic power at expense of narrative complexity.</comment>
