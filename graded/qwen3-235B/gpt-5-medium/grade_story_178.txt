<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's grief and perseverance are clear but underdeveloped; sister remains a plot device rather than a full presence. The protagonist's voice is distinct, but internal conflicts remain hinted rather than explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linear progression from routine to revelation to cure aligns with word count, though quantum breath mechanics feel abrupt. The sister's condition provides emotional throughline, and the ending offers resolution without melodrama.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Glass cathedral under sea combines beauty and pressure brilliantly. Dissonance between sterile science and organic wonder reinforces the tone, though some descriptors (e.g., "panes clouded with unfamiliar algae") verge on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rare fusion of biological and metaphysical themes through stamp metaphors. The closing line masterfully unites quantum theory and sibling love, creating emotional resonance that transcends sci-fi conventions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original use of stamps as literal and metaphorical thresholds. Avoids AI tropes by grounding surreal concepts in tactile sensory details (glue, perforations, seawater). Language remains purposeful despite poetic complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through precise metaphor connections, but some elements (trivia night encounter, abrupt world-warping) feel like narrative scaffolding rather than organic growth. Ambition exceeds strict success.</comment>
