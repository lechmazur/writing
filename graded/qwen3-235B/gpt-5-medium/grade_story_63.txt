<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Minimal character interiority; concept-driven narrative prioritizes symbolism over psychological depth, though traits like "reserved" and "humbly proud" shape actions. Character remains more metaphor than human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Circular, lyrical progression lacks traditional conflict or stakes; plot exists as a series of poetic gestures. The "mend" action is conceptually clear but lacks narrative urgency or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with jars of echoes and humming wire creates immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (dust, trembling glass) deepen world-building, but timeframe integration feels passive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite use of metaphor ("grief and giggles braided like twine") and thematic resonance around preservation vs. ownership. Ending elevates storytelling beyond plot through emotional subtext about legacy and collaboration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in "laboratory of lost sounds" concept and "stitching silence into memory" is strong, but occasional lushness strains credulity (e.g., "thread remembered dawn"). Avoids formulaic character motivations and overused emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical cohesion and thematic ambition outweigh structural looseness. Assigned elements form a functional skeleton but occasionally lack connective tissue; some elements (e.g., conductor, choir's transformation) feel vaguely purposeful rather than essential.</comment>
