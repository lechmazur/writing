<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and consistent, with motivation clearly tied to the central mission. However, the protagonist remains more symbolic than psychologically nuanced, and their "unseen observer" role limits emotional interiority despite effective use of the plastic whistle as a narrative anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical structure with strong momentum, balancing poetic digression with the clear progression from vigil to transcendence. The whale's call and dancer's arrival provide pivotal turning points, though the resolution's abrupt shift from individual to collective lacks gradual emotional buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details create an immersive, mythic atmosphere where even synthetic objects (plastic whistle) feel organic. The haunted lighthouse becomes a living entity, and the kelp-robed dancer embodies ecological memory, though some metaphors risk over-saturation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonant subtext about cultural preservation through embodied practice. The dancer's "aggressively kind" corrections reframe tradition as active defense rather than passive relic. Ending avoids trite redemption through collective remembrance rather than finality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Strikes a rare equilibrium between lyrical density and precision. Evocative phrases ("whale calls braided with salt") avoid clich√© while maintaining clarity. No redundant descriptors; emotional texture emerges through action rather than exposition. The plastic whistle as sacred object subverts expectations organically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic coherence rather than checklist inclusion. The brevity sharpens focus on pivotal moments without sacrificing narrative weight. Lingering questions about cultural erasure and rebirth invite deeper contemplation, while the "brazen calm" tone sustains through structural shifts.</comment>
