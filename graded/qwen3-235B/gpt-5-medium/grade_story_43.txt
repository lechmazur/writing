<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's wariness and introversion shape narration more than actions; motivations hinted but lack depth in driving plot consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented imagery overrides clear progression; cause-effect relationships between actions are poetic but structurally diffuse.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive with electric decay and melancholy; some symbolic details stretch beyond believable logic (fireflies in industrial fog).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (cd as fractured heartbeats) and thematic resonance (courage as collaborative act) add depth; abstract passages dilute emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original setting but over-reliance on metaphor-as-narrative; some phrases (e.g., crooked hope) lean on poetic vagueness over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through mood and repetition rather than deliberate structural economy; memorable in style, uneven in substance.</comment>
