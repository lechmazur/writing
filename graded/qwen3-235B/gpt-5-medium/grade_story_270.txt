<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character voice is strong but lacks emotional depth; motivations (harnessing ephemeral) are poetic but underdeveloped. "Humbly arrogant" trait is stated more than demonstrated through action or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythmic prose creates momentum but lacks traditional plot progression; no clear arc or resolution. Events are atmospheric but loosely connected, sacrificing narrative cohesion for lyricism.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion—salt-velvet blend, trembling windows, breathing fog—crafts haunting isolation. The lighthouse’s timeless decay and tactile decay of objects (e.g., "bruised" globe) anchor the haunting tone flawlessly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("salt crown," "soot ghosts") and subtext (ephemeral as both concept and metaphor for memory) elevate impact. Ending’s paradoxical "light went out and kept shining" resonates thematically, though emotional stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Language borders on purple prose but avoids cliché through precise, original imagery ("maps of absences," "fingerprints bruising the globe"). Nuanced emotional resonance emerges via symbolism rather than explicit feeling, with only minor formal redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not structurally; the story feels more like a prose poem than narrative. Assigned elements serve mood over plot, creating lingering atmosphere but sacrificing urgency or transformative stakes.</comment>
