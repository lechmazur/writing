<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pronounced voice but underdeveloped motivations; operates more as symbolic archetype than relatable character. Voice's poetic detachment undermines emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented progression lacks traditional tension; poetic momentum compensates through cyclical structure but sacrifices narrative logic. Resolutions feel ritualistic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere dominates over setting specificity; espionage elements decorative rather than formative. Sensory details flourish in abstract metaphors but rarely establish physical space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphorical density creates lingering resonance; candle-to-chorus-to-confession sequence exemplifies powerful symbolic choreography. Some poetic indulgence dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Uncommon metaphors (hindsight's "loose pearls," candle drips as "tiny ellipsis") refresh genre conventions. Tone balances precision and ambiguity without collapsing into outright pretension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere through language first, narrative second. Ambitious thematic layering occasionally strains logical connections between espionage framework and metaphysical execution.</comment>
