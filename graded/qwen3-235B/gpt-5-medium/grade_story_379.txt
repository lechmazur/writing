<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve languages is clear but underdeveloped; character’s “trickster” traits primarily procedural, not psychological; interactions with rivals lack emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cryptic dares drive the plot but create disjointed segments; coherence strained by compressed word limit; resolution feels abrupt despite cyclical structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Biodome’s sensory details (e.g., “consonants bees abandon”) create immersive, eerie atmosphere; tension between hi-tech and organic elements sharpens thematic contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., phonemes in chlorophyll) and subtext about language-as-resistance elevate the narrative; emotional resonance undercut by detached, cerebral tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of legal surrealism and linguistic preservation avoids formula; avoids clichés through specific imagery (e.g., “decoy subpoenas”); no forced sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work collectively despite intermittent friction; brevity sharpens mystery rather than limiting it; themes of defiance and preservation linger conceptually.</comment>
