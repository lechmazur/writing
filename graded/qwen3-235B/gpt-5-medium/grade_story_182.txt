<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and introspective without concrete motivations or development. Lacks consistent psychological depth or tangible actions linking "unknowing heir" to plot progression; serves more as poetic device than realized persona.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Prioritizes atmosphere over plot; lacks traditional narrative arc or causal progression. Disconnected sequences generate impressionistic tone but minimal forward motion, weakening coherence within the constrained form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vividly rendered through kinetic decay and electromagnetic motifs (iron filings, misfiring projector). The magnetic mountain's pull and projector's "dusty light" create visceral, uncanny atmosphere where setting becomes active collaborator in thematic tension between erasure and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses metaphor with surgical precision ("spoon remembering a mouth it never fed") to explore legacy and authorship. The central conflict (certainty vs. chaos) emerges organically through the spoon's passage through time and the pact with entropy. Ending feels earned though resolution remains ambiguously poetic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality lies in electrifying juxtapositions (e.g., "quiet hunger" negotiating nothingness, magnetized pigments) and refusal of literal interpretation. Avoids AI-flavored clich√©s through audacious synesthesia but occasionally loses impact to baroque constructions ("trivially monumental sacrament").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Linguistically dazzling but structurally diffuse. Assigned elements serve as aesthetic anchors rather than narrative engines; atmospheric strength cannot fully compensate for underdeveloped dramatic throughline despite resonant closing gesture.</comment>
