<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations lack granular development; the 'poisoner' trait is underutilized beyond the surface-level metaphor, and subtle emotional stakes remain underexplored despite strong atmospheric hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively through scavenger hunt logic, but the scavenger hunt itself feels overly abstract. Pacing wavers in the middle, and the resolution hinges on symbolic gestures rather than concrete emotional or narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting and mood are richly rendered with tactile details (dust, skate sounds), but the museum’s symbolic weight overshadows its physical logic. Sensory elements evoke atmosphere but occasionally verge on poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (poison as truth, skateboarding as instinct) are evocative, and the ending’s emotional resonance implies deeper themes. Subtext about mentorship and legacy ties into the theme but risks being under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending skate culture, poisons, and museum mystique avoids clichés, but some metaphors (e.g., “winter” as honesty) feel overdetermined. Style leans into lyrical risk but avoids overwhelming the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements are mostly integrated, though some (like the “code of instinct”) feel appended rather than organic. The brevity feels intentional, favoring mood over resolution, with mixed success in balancing poetic abstraction and narrative clarity.</comment>
