<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters serve theme more than display nuanced psychology; actions align with assigned traits but lack distinct voice or inner conflict. The trapper's motivation is clear but abstracted into allegory rather than visceral human experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conflict with official drives the plot, but the resolution feels compressed; ceremonial schoolhouse visit and dice throw reveal structural tension but the arc gains momentum abruptly. Pacing effective for word count but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic setting rendered with visceral sensory details (grease, sizzle, neon hum). Flaking paint as melting snowdrifts and chalk storms for heat flows showcase inventive fusion of mechanical and organic elements that deepen mood and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (recipes as resistance, dice as encoded language) and subtext (heritage as untranslatable formula) create layered meaning. Ending feels symbolic rather than earned; writing style alternates between lyrical precision and occasional over-embellishment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of indigenous knowledge and mechanical metaphor avoids easy tropes. Some phrases lean toward poetic abstraction ("chalk storms spelled heat flows"), but ideas like translating stewardship through smoke spirals feel authentically unexpected rather than algorithmically surprising.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit preservation vs progress theme. Story leverages brevity for poetic density, though character remains more archetypal than human. Lingers thematically but emotional resonance stays just beneath surface.</comment>
