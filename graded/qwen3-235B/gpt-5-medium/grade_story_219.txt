<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Characters function as archetypes rather than psychologically complex beings; motivations are metaphysical but lack human-scale emotional grounding or concrete behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Circular structure emphasizes stasis over plot progression; symbolic gestures substitute for narrative cause-effect and resolution; poetic density compensates for thin dramatic momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gorgeous, cohesive sensory alchemy (e.g., "scent of rain on old soil," "corn husk rasped like patience") creates a vivid, dreamlike logic that immerses readers in the story's existential concerns.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful metaphoric layering (origami as memory mapping, corn husk as temporal metaphor) and resonant circularity elevate the story into profound meditation on consciousness; sparse yet electric prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical precision avoids most purple prose pitfalls, but occasional overreliance on abstract binaries ("comforting disturbance") risks obscuring visceral immediacy; metaphors feel human-curated rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</comment><grade>9.5</grade>Story's symbolic economy works cohesively but favors aesthetic beauty over emotional urgency; brevity enhances mystery but limits narrative consequence; lingers as a haunting riddle without resolution.
