<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's internal state is poetically rendered but lacks concrete motivation; surly disposition informs behavior but isn't meaningfully challenged or developed through interaction with other elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot functions as meditation rather than narrative; lacks causal progression between events. Resolution feels imposed rather than earned through action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Marriage of sailor's graveyard and liminal timeframe creates visceral atmosphere; salt, gull cries, and memorials immerse reader in existential maritime melancholy without overwriting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (rosary of currents, constellations as IOUs) and recursive structure mirror thematic tension between control and surrender; ending crystallizes thematic payoff through poetic transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids mechanical repetition despite lush description; "yarn's memory" and "shared fare" exhibit human-crafted conceptual layering, though occasional phrases like "horizon priced" veer toward thematic redundancy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere and craft carry the piece beyond its sparse narrative arc; elements cohere thematically but unevenly serve forward motion, making brevity feel like limitation not choice.</comment>
