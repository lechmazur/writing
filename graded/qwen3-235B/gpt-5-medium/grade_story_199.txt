<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation (goddess echo) drives actions but character's strict adherence to abstract "regulations" lacks deeper conflict; underdeveloped reactions to pivotal encounters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ethereal plot progression through symbolic encounters maintains coherence but climactic resolution feels abrupt, undermined by compressed arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Highway-overpass orchard fused with bureaucratic surrealism creates haunting atmosphere; synesthetic details (whistle of wind, humming trees) immerse fully.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("bruised promises," "unscent exits") deepen meaning; ending resonates thematically through environmental personification; slightly undermined by inconsistent emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of bureaucratic absurdity and mythic symbolism; avoids clich√© through precise imagery; "traffic cone crowns" and "heartbreak orchard" showcase originality; minimal forced abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Coherence achieved through poetic logic over plot mechanics; brevity feels intentional but some elemental integration (grandmother's role) remains underexplored.</comment>
