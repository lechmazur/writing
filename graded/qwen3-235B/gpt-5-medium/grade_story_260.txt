<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation and method are deeply intertwined with their obsessive devotion, but psychological depth remains surface-level despite strong narrative voice. The crossword obsession defines every action yet lacks inner conflict that would elevate it beyond a metaphorical device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear progression mimics puzzle-solving, creating structural cohesion through thematic resonance rather than traditional cause-effect. The starless-night framing provides satisfying circularity, but the brevity denies full emotional payoff for the "solved" conclusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from rich metaphors (carbon paper/ghosts, ink restoration), though the workshop setting remains abstract rather than visceral. Somnambulant pacing enhances mood, while "kitchens/hospital wards" flash worldbuilding creates fleeting tactile moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Language operates on multiple poetic registers simultaneously - crosswords as both structural motif and existential meditation. Combines technical puzzle craft with spiritual yearning through elegant parallelism, creating lasting resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Persuasive originality in framing puzzles as metaphysical tools rather than mere intellectual exercises. Avoids formulaic writing through alchemical fusion of cryptic structure and emotional reckoning, though occasional phrases flirt with baroque excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite balance of conceptual ambition and narrative precision. Each element serves thematic ends while maintaining standalone lyrical beauty. The compressed form becomes a virtue, mirroring crossword's economy of space to explore vast emotional territory.</comment>
