<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character is a vessel for poetic abstractions rather than a person with believable agency; motivations are conceptually sound but emotionally distant, conveyed through ornate metaphor rather than psychological realism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meandering progression relies on poetic rhythm rather than narrative causality; the arc from dilemma to resolution feels predetermined and ritualistic rather than earned through concrete action or discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally inert setting; the floating lounge and endless city create a dreamlike coherence, though some sensorial density verges on self-indulgent abstraction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stylistic strength in imagery and metaphor, but emotional resonance remains cerebral rather than visceral; the ending's thematic payoff is conceptually neat but emotionally muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Language is original and purposeful, avoiding clich√©s, but occasionally lapses into ornate cadence that feels more performative than functionally expressive; subtextual layers are present but narrowly scoped.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly cohesive in its surreal logic and thematic focus on mapping time, though the poetic density creates a barrier to emotional engagement or narrative momentum; the brief form serves the ethereal tone but limits development.</comment>
