<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but lacks psychological depth; motivations (data hunger vs. city safety) feel plot-convenient rather than psychologically rooted. The "unluckiness" trait shapes the narrative more than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity through the memory-for-wisdom tradeoff, but pacing stumbles where the elder negotiations compress complex stakes. Cause-effect logic holds but resolution feels narratively abbreviated within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Bitter honey taste/appearance, molting diplomat, and stone-choked starlight create immersive verisimilitude. Sensory details like saltlight lanterns and ticking seedpods fuse organically with mood. Lizard people customs remain underexplored but atmosphere compensates.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors refract deep themes (e.g., "bad luck was timing between colliding interests") and the sextant-as-bell climax resonates. Dialogue with the archivist lacks subtext, but the subversion of "weather reports as lullabies" elevates storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>No trope-reliance; combines cosmic/earthbound tensions with originality. Language remains purposeful despite density; avoids stating emotions through the metaphor-rich exchange with the diplomat. "Fungus market shortcut" feels conceptually strained but others deeply integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like the sextant and systematic chaos meaningfully intersect with themes of precision vs. entropy. While momentum occasionally falters around memory trades and timekeeping vines, the endingâ€™s mythic-technical fusion lingers ambiguously.</comment>
