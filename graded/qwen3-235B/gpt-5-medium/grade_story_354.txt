<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (daring compassion, chasing auroras) drive the plot, but the self-taught wizard's personality remains abstract. The child is a symbolic construct, not a fully realized character. Emotional resonance relies on metaphor over psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear mythic arc (portal opening, rescue, cyclical conclusion) but relies on poetic leaps rather than logical causality. Virtual reality mechanisms feel half-defined. The 500-word constraint creates abrupt transitions between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Virtual reality archive has visceral, otherworldly atmosphere—its digital ghosts and unrendered walls succeed. Sensory details excel (ringing fingertips, starlight as "polite errors") but occasional overabundance of tech-mystic metaphors risks tonal incoherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors ("firewall prohibitions," "starlight errors") and recursive structure create profound subtext about love's persistence in data. Ending crystallizes the theme of intergenerational trauma/empathy. Emotional impact emerges through symbolic layering, not explicit explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Daring compassion subverts hero tropes (lantern vs. hunter). Avoids AI clichés through idiosyncratic imagery (encrypted gravity, "caching" the child's room). Occasionally veers into ornate abstraction that feels self-indulgent rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements combine ingeniously (teddy bear's gravity, auroras as "lost kindness") but coherence hinges on poetic logic over narrative rigor. The ending's philosophical weight lingers, though technical plot mechanics remain deliberately ambiguous.</comment>
