<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character's role as bodyguard and motivation to rebel against control are clear, but internal conflicts remain underexplored; the "serene anger" trait is consistent but could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward efficiently, but the rapid resolution after the spores' release feels slightly rushed despite strong causal links; pacing mostly effective within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting immerses through vivid lunar greenhouse details and sensory textures (mint moss, spores), creating a contained, artificial ecosystem that mirrors political and ecological tensions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (e.g., "anger stretched across basalt," photograph as "compass") create layered themes; ending resonates with symbolic rebirth and earned catharsis; subtext elevates above surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Minimal clich√©s or purple prose; voice feels human-nuanced (e.g., "collage of overheard fragments" over-explaining); some similes ("anger like a thin pond film") risk over-refinement but mostly serve tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements combine organically to support theme; lyrical style maintains clarity while embracing brevity; ending leaves resonance about collective autonomy and environmental stewardship.</comment>
