<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character has a distinct voice and consistent motivations tied to preservation-as-pilgrimage, but emotional depth remains abstracted by excessive metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows through atmospheric beats rather than narrative cause-effect, weakening the arc's urgency despite poetic cohesion between departure and return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic levers rather than arbitrary adornments; brevity amplifies the story's metaphysical concerns without feeling constrained.</comment>
