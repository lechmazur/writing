<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters feel archetypal rather than psychologically real; motivations (e.g., the tutor's cryptic demands, protagonist's compliance) are driven by symbolic logic rather than human consistency. The "unhinged zealot" lacks interiority, functioning more as a surreal obstacle than a coherent character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pseudo-narrative progresses through poetic image accumulation rather than traditional causality. The uprooting sequence provides a small-scale arc, but thematic echoes (trembling hands, bottle cap confessions) substitute for plot progression. Pacing risks monotony but gains momentum through pattern repetition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric sensory fusion of jungle and parlor (vine-choked furniture, damp-absorbed anxiety) creates an immersive, paradoxical environment. The precise texture of "steaming books" and "velvet lectern shadows" deepens the uncanny atmosphere beyond mere quirkiness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors like "confessing to a bottle cap" and "arguments shivering" achieve visceral resonance. The ending's symbolic transaction with the cap rewards careful reading. Subtext (fear of vulnerability) permeates without exposition. Prose remains stylistically courageous without descending into self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality resides in surreal combinations (e.g., "umbrellas as sacraments") but occasional overuse of paradox ("honest instrument," "terrifying gentleness") borders on formulaic obscurity. Emotions are shown through precise gestures (furniture rearrangement as approval), resisting simplistic declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Moment-to-moment prose dazzles while eliding conventional narrative expectations. The bottle cap motif unifies disparate elements, and the exploration of vulnerability as theological practice offers intellectual heft. Some surreal jumps maintain a dreamlike cohesion rather than strict logic.</comment>
