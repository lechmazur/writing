<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has internal conflict and symbolic actions, but limited dimensionality in brief narrative. Motivation via named sacrifices works, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows an emotional arc over a physical one, with rising action through confession to climax in shattering silence. Pacing maintains momentum within constraints despite compressed resolution of themes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, original setting details create immersive environment where luminescent slime molds and fungal growths viscerally reinforce themes of decomposition/invention. Atmosphere occasionally overshadows character development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors like "courtroom of futures" and "parchment ribbons of weather" demonstrate masterful craft. Subtext about traded identities and political costs lingers beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with fungal biopunk imagery and conceptual courage machine. Certain passages verge on purple prose but generally maintain purposeful abstraction rather than empty ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements function as interdependent metaphors (orchard as hinge, wind chimes as memory vessels). Resolution introduces new concept (engineers with translation device) that risks conceptual overextension but rewards thematic coherence.</comment>
