<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's rebellion lacks concrete grounding in action; motivations (priming heart for wonder) feel abstract and inconsistently pursued. Voice is poetic but risks vagueness over distinct characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a vague trajectory from entering haunted house to answering a call; lacks clear stakes or arc. The confined scope creates artificial cohesion but sacrifices narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (neon skeletons, sodium light) immerse effectively, but the setting's potential as a metaphorical space for emotional states remains underdeveloped. Gloom is evoked but inconsistently connected to character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery elevates style, but emotional resonance is diluted by overreliance on metaphor. The ending attempts thematic closure (rebuilding with broth/adaptation) that feels conceptual rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending rebellion with culinary nostalgia, but risks self-indulgent prose. Subtext about emotional adaptation is promising but undermined by generic descriptions of sensory details and abrupt thematic shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outpaces execution; elements strain against coherence in service of poetic juxtapositions. Style occasionally supports substance but often obscures it, leaving emotional and thematic impact underdeveloped.</comment>
