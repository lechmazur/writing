<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations exist abstractly rather than through tangible stakes. Personality manifests mainly through surreal actions rather than decisions. Dialogue absent, "voice" exists solely through poetic description that occasionally becomes self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot unfolds through poetic associations rather than causal logic. Pacing feels compressed - citywide dance climax lacks earned emotional weight. Thematic conclusion about collective rituals satisfies intellectually but lacks narrative payoff. Some mystical plot mechanics remain unearned through story logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Imaginative worldbuilding elevates the piece. Sensory details like "air plants sang" and "listening termites" create vivid immersion. Setting actively shapes action through its verticality and organic materials. Atmosphere's whimsical gravitas perfectly aligns with surreal premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors ("grin certified by termites") and lyrical imagery create lasting impact. Subtext about cultural preservation resonates through physical storytelling. Ending connects ritual to communal nourishment, though emotional engagement remains intellectual rather than visceral. Narrative shows strong thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in unconventional connections (dancing to confuse gravity) but occasionally suffers from overwritten descriptions ("comet tail" shoelace). Avoids genre tropes through phantasmal logic but contains some ornate redundancies. Subtextual depth elevates above formulaic patterns.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>All elements present but varying degrees of integration. Treehouses organically influence structure while staircase/tomb feels conceptually separate. Story prioritizes atmosphere over conventional cohesion. Ambition exceeds execution - poetic ambition evident, but some imposed elements struggle to cohere into unified whole.</comment>
