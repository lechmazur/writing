<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character defined through poetic self-restraint and tactile rituals, motivation implied through atmospheric resistance to erasure, but lacks emotional depth in grappling with existential paradoxes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unconventional plot progression via sensory rituals creates cohesion, though the terminal’s revelation feels underdeveloped thematically; pacing delicately balances mystery against resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere merges decay and cosmic curiosity through salt-rust dichotomies, tactile lavender symbolism, and avian bureaucracy. Setting is the narrative’s true protagonist, humming with melancholic wonder.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors crystallize into a tactile philosophy of preserved uncertainty; the ending’s refusal to resolve tension between curiosity and custodianship lingers as profound metaphor for artistic creation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality shines through synesthetic logic (scents-as-passwords, myths-as-blueprints), but occasional rhythmic uniformity in sentence structure and over-reliance on elliptical abstraction flirt with ornamental excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a mythopoeic machine where narrative gaps function as aesthetic features; style elevates constraint into virtue while maintaining thematic resonance about custodianship’s ethical ambiguities.</comment>
