<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually vivid but lacks concrete emotional grounding; motivations (connecting storm chasing to restoration) are poetically implied rather than fully embodied through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a meditative arc rather than traditional structure; the carousel restoration drives coherence, but momentum falters in abstract metaphoric digressions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting contrasts (desert vs. monastery) and sensory details (shifting air layers) create immersive, emotionally resonant atmosphere; monastery's role feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and thematic interplay (patience vs. motion) create lasting impact; some "showing" through metaphor overwhelms simpler human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original metaphor combinations elevate the story, but phrases like "nostalgic innovation" occasionally lean on abstract cliche without deeper exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Story works within constraints to merge elements with theme, but some components feel more decorative than essential to the narrative's emotional core.</grade>
