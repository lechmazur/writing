<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are poetically implied but lack concrete backstory or emotional texture that would make the reconciliation with the censor feel earned rather than merely aestheticized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent emotional arc within a compressed structure, though transitions between lyrical passages occasionally risk diluting the narrative momentum required for a fully visceral resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Steampunk dining hall and memory framework fuse vividly with thematic elements (e.g., mechanized oppression vs. salvaged artistry), though some sensory details verge on overwhelming coherence for coherence’s sake.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric layering (mixtapes as buried memory, stickers as emotional cataloging) elevates the narrative, though emotional impact leans heavily on stylistic audacity over sustained character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story avoids clichés with inventive metaphors and avoids explicit emotional tells, but some phrases ("savage grace," "hollow victory") flirt with abstraction that could mask underdevelopment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively to produce a resonant, thematically unified story despite its brevity; the tight focus on reconciliation through art feels deliberate, not constrained.</comment>
