<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's metaphor-laden voice distinguishes them, but motivations remain abstract; "docile bruiser" informs physicality more than psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Twist in the baton's function creates thematic cohesion, but rapid resolution feels truncated; drum solos and plants complicate rather than propel plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic details (hissing plants, trembling pollen) immerse readers, though the greenhouse's surreal logic occasionally obscures narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (baton as myth-maker, drumming as language) elevates thematic resonance; ending crystallizes the tension between power and creation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original fusion of music, flora, and myth-making avoids genre traps, though some phrases ("mud of reality") verge on aestheticized abstraction over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements combine inventively but unevenly; drum solos and brash tenderness concept feel selectively integrated despite atmospheric richness.</comment>
