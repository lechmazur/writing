<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vague mystic element provides atmospheric flair but lacks psychological depth; motivation to chronicle family histories ties to the narrative but feels more symbolic than grounded in personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Non-linear plot prioritizes poetic resonance over conventional structure; the connection between lab experiments and emotional resolution feels conceptually cohesive but occasionally abstracted by the 500-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Viscerally rendered hybrid of sterile lab and oceanic metaphor creates haunting, immersive tension; sensory details (brine, metallic hums, sunburned photos) masterfully reinforce thematic duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Profound emotional subtext about inherited memory and parental absence lingers through precise, haunting metaphors; ending achieves mythic, recursive closure that rewards reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Language is lavish yet purposeful, avoiding self-indulgence through rigorous symbolic consistency; metaphors ("cells learned faces like sailors read harbors") feel startlingly original, not merely decorative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels both deliberate and strainedâ€”the polaroids/compass/creatures work on theme level, but some assigned terms (flamboyance, override) require interpretive contortions to fully justify their presence.</comment>
