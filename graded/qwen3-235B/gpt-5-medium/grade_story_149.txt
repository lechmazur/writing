<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth; the prophet’s motivation is stated but underdemonstrated through action or nuanced reaction. Voice leans poetic but lacks psychological specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Disjointed progression of events; cause/effect blurred by abstract imagery. Resolution feels thematic rather than structural. Pacing meanders despite atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid, haunting sensory details (ink pools, laundromat’s wet sermons) immerse readers, though setting’s surreal logic undercuts narrative stakes. Atmosphere prioritized over plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "socks rotating together") and lyrical prose elevate the story, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. Theme of connection is clear, yet subtext feels occasionally didactic.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in metaphorical worldbuilding, though occasional over-reliance on ornate phrasing risks obscuring meaning. Balances poetic language with moments of startling specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements interwoven thematically (e.g., "unify scattered minds" via glimmering transitions) but lack narrative urgency. Lingering questions about purposeful ambiguity vs. vagueness.</comment>
