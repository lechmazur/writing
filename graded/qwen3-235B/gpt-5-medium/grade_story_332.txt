<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is evocative but static, defined more through poetic abstraction than concrete psychology. Motivation to reconcile separation through art remains diffuse, lacking visceral urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves through lyrical accretion rather than dramatic beats. Triptych structure provides coherence but progression from beginning to end feels more thematic than emotionally earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dreamlike setting achieves immersive vividness through precise sensory details ("leaves learning choreography of weightlessness") and tonal congruence with melancholic tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric layering elevates narrative. The triptych as metaphor for existential transition and plants as living metaphors for separation create powerful emotional subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</comment><story avoids generic sci-fi tropes through inventive imagery (chlorophyll constellations) and emotional nuance. Some ornate phrasing risks preciousness but overall maintains stylistic integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story maintains elegant cohesion across elements with thematic consistency about embracing release. Certain lyrical flourishes occasionally prioritize style over narrative propulsion.</comment>
