<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character as metaphysical concept more than human; motivations (overturning absence, cosmic balance) abstract but internally consistent. First-person voice maintains distinctiveness but lacks emotional depth beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure mirrors thematic cyclical rebirth. Overthrow mechanism feels inevitable despite condensed form. Some mystical resolutions strain causality but work within the story's mythologic tone.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rain-as-memory, basalt mouths, and silt-buried weapons create immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming compasses, rattling figurines) amplify existential dread. Setting and theme inextricable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphor density achieves poetic transcendence (shards as heart-voids, silence sharing chairs). Ending rewards contemplation rather than providing resolution. Conflict between entropy/making-structure resonates beneath surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√© but occasionally dips into obscurantism. Sentences balance rhythmic precision against occasional over-tuning. No genre tropes; metaphors consistently surprising but occasionally self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements interlocking suggests intentional architecture rather than checklist usage. Ambiguous scale (personal/cosmic) allows multiple interpretations. Word constraints enhance, rather than restrict, scope.</comment>
