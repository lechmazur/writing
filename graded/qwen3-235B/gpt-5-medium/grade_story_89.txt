<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character lacks definable personality; motivation for the revolution exists as abstract poetry without psychological or situational grounding. Actions (placing nail in capsule) remain symbolic gestures without discernible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot fractures into disconnected metaphors; no clear progression from beginning to end. Placement of capsules is the only concrete action, but cause-effect relationships dissolve beneath lyrical abstraction. Pacing lingers on imagery at the expense of momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (rust, starlight, meteor-dented armor) but setting functions as backdrop rather than active force. Sensory details overwhelm without clarifying how environment shapes character or action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Language dazzles with metaphors merging spirituality and physics, but emotional core remains elusive. Ending's "footprints" and "soul as tool" provide faint thematic cohesion. Subtext about legacy as resistance lingers faintly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original phrasing exists, yet pattern of "paradox + celestial imagery + revolutionary metaphor" becomes formulaic. Overuse of paradoxical descriptors ("sanctified frost") risks obscuring meaning. Nuanced emotion absent; replaced with abstract sensations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>ELEMENTS FEEL ASSEMBLED, NOT INTEGRATED: warrior's dented armor and dew-stained receipts exist side-by-side without deeper synthesis. Style-as-substance approach works for atmosphere but weakens narrative cohesion. Lingers more as mood than resonant story.</comment>
