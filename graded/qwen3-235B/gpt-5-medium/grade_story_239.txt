<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (threading a labyrinth with stories, confronting brother's vanishing) is clear but underdeveloped; emotional complexity exists but lacks grounding in concrete actions or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a haunting logic but suffers from rushed pacing; pivotal transitions (power outage, card ritual) feel loosely connected despite lyrical cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush, immersive atmosphere (sawdust-scented rooms, radiant light shifts) and symbolic setting as living archive deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Enigmatic prose and recursive symbolism (tree rings as memory, breath as connection) create profound emotional resonance and metaphysical subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "radiant shifts," "portable grove") enrich thematic depth without lapsing into ornamental excess, though occasional abstraction risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>ELEMENTS: All assigned elements are tightly woven into thematic fabric, but power outage and "threading labyrinth" mechanics feel slightly utilitarian rather than organically inevitable.</comment>
