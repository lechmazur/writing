<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong consistency between character traits and actions; the farmer's earthy background and archival motivation drive the narrative. Voice leans poetic but maintains distinctiveness despite occasional stylistic mannerisms.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear progression from preparation to playback, though some transitions (e.g., aurora reacting to music) risk feeling mystical without deeper causality. Pacing manages compression but loses minor traction in middle sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: the northern lights as "folding silk" and "hushed euphoria" are evocative. Sensory details (frost-ticking rails, clove-oil warmth) ground the uncanny process in tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (aurora as hymn-alignment, silence as oppression) are layered. The intergenerational restoration effort carries universal weight, balanced with precise imagery avoiding clich√©. Ending crystallizes theme without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids formula through specific, mythic framing of audio restoration as alchemy. Minor issues: "dampness from lightning-charged barn" strains plausibility; some phrases ("mantled seed") border on ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements feel intentionally chosen and interdependent (recipe ingredients, aurora's responsiveness). The story transcends its brevity by anchoring each detail to emotional stakes, leaving resonance through the "spent vines" metaphor.</comment>
