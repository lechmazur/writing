<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Characters exist as poetic constructs rather than fully realized figures; Laleh's "skewed visionary" status remains more concept than lived experience, with motivations implied through metaphor rather than emotional specificity or interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional dramatic arc or causal momentum; vignettes accumulate atmospherically but lack interdependence, resembling lyrical essay more than structured narrative within the constrained format.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory textures immerse readers in a liminal space, though the "temporal anomaly" remains abstract backdrop rather than integrated mechanism; historical erasure depicted more through aesthetic arrangement than lived consequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Luminous prose elevates the story - metaphors (e.g., "time rubs time like hands," "barcode into bell") resonate with haunting specificity; the documentary impulse as elegiac time-capture achieves philosophical heft without sermonizing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evasive of genre tropes; "soap makers steaming cauldrons" and "palimpsests selling as souvenir menus" exemplify precise, non-generic imagery; avoids AI-style abstraction through concrete verbs and material focus despite lyrical tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive as prose poem but strained as narrative; assigned elements function as thematic threads rather than functional architecture; the brevity enhances poetic density while undermining dramatic payoff.</comment>
