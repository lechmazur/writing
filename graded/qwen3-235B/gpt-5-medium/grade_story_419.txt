<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's no-nonsense demeanor and empathy are evident through sparse but purposeful actions, but lacks depth in psychological realism or internal conflict that would ground their motivations more concretely.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses coherently through tactile problem-solving, but the condensed form sacrifices secondary stakes or obstacles that could sharpen the narrative arc within the limited space.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immaculately rendered through sensory-rich descriptions of spectral machinery and dying light, creating an immersive, haunting mood where the setting becomes a character itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original premise merges craft and metaphysics without genre clich√©s, but a few ornate phrases and conceptual explanations (e.g., "arterial path") risk overdirecting the reader's interpretation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around the symbiosis of tradition and transformation, though the brevity leaves some connections between elements implied rather than dramatized with full tension.</comment>
