<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and thematically resonant, but emotional depth and psychological complexity are subsumed entirely by metaphor, making internal struggles feel abstract rather than viscerally relatable.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses through conceptually rich actions with symbolic momentum, but the condensed form leaves some cause-effect transitions (e.g., giants' abrupt shift) feeling more implied than dramatized within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric workshop details (sleeping furnaces, scent-coded history) create thick atmosphere, though 'golden age' timeframe remains underexploited as a distinct temporal contrast to the setting's stagnation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness ("gardener of embers," "soot-brushed sleeves") and recursive structural parallels between labyrinth, memory, and institutional transformation offer profound thematic layers that transcend pure whimsy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Linguistic inventiveness ("precisely playful swirls," "rivets that ring like Yes") dazzles without veering into pure ornamentation, though some phrasing risks becoming a self-contained aesthetic loop rather than narrative engine.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements cohere into a unified mythopoeic whole with thematic resonance, though certain components like the 'golden age' framing could better anchor the narrative's timelessness to concrete stakes.</comment>
