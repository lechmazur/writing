<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters remain abstract archetypes rather than fully realized individuals; motivations (e.g., spiritual yearning) are implied but lack psychological depth or distinct voice in introspective narration</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular, meditative pattern rather than linear progression; cohesion exists but feels intentional only to a point, with key revelations lacking dramatic weight or clear transformational arcs</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and texturally rich, with luminous sensory details blending the mundane (cashierâ€™s register) and ethereal (cloud-temple), though the setting occasionally suppresses emotional immediacy</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Compounding metaphors (e.g., heart/language, binder clip/gravity) create resonance; ending achieves emotional lift-off, but some imagery risks becoming self-parodying in its preciousness</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Certain phrases ("fragile yet stubborn seedlings") border on AI-flavored abstraction, though the lace-to-mask removal sequence demonstrates inventive, emotionally textured execution</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Narrative coherence is admirable for density of symbolism, but sacrifices emotional clarity; the "market and monastery" punchline feels forced rather than organically earned</comment>
