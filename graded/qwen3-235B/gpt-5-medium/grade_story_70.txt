<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's traits are conceptually present (rigid spine, ledger of rituals) but inconsistent in application (sudden emotional shifts lack foundational nuance). Voice is distinct but filtered through excessive metaphor, weakening psychological authenticity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure has thematic cohesion (analysis-to-empathy arc) but suffers from abstract causality (adhesive revelations, filament reactivation). Pacing is uneven; transformation moment feels narratively compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured (grave-root scent, humming greenhouse) but secondary to plot—gravestones remain ornamental rather than emotionally integral. Sensory details are immersive but over-reliant on poetic cataloging.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric density elevates craft (ink/glue dichotomy, filament as memory). Subtextual tension between rigidity and fluidity resonates, though overwrought imagery occasionally obscures emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clichés through surreal combinations (Tesla tech/witchcraft), but "certainly uncertain" phrasing and quasi-mystical resolutions verge on artificial profundity. Metaphors feel human-crafted but occasionally opaque.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements create a thematic mosaic rather than unified narrative engine. Some components (gravestones, ledger) function more as ambiance than narrative drivers. Lingering impression is strong despite structural fragility.</comment>
