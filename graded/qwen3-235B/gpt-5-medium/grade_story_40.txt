<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive but inconsistently embodied; Mina's reincarnation as goldfish is an intriguing detail but doesn't sufficiently shape her actions or motivations beyond surface irony. Relationships develop through metaphor rather than organic interaction, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Compact structure balances episodic moments but strains under brevity constraints; transitions between key narrative beats (storm, encounter, plot twist) feel compressed. Resolution with child visitor satisfies thematic symmetry but lacks earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory-rich library environment merges culinary and archival elements masterfully; cinnamon-damp decay and edible metaphors create immersive tension between preservation and transformation. Timeframe mechanics with "doctor's chart" add existential undercurrents without disrupting atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose operates on multiple layers: culinary terminology serves as political metaphor, historical trauma filters through recipe annotations. The seaweed substitution becomes a radical political act through subtle tonal manipulation. Ending balances ambiguity and closure to haunting effect.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing that obscures momentum. Metaphors generally fresh (fish patterns as "errant captions"), though reincarnation conceit risks preciousness. Emotional stakes emerge through subtext rather than projection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weaves disparate elements into cohesive thematic tapestry about memory's role in cultural evolution. The tight focus on culinary rebellion through specific objects sustains narrative momentum despite ambitious conceptual scope, though some symbolic threads remain underdeveloped.</comment>
