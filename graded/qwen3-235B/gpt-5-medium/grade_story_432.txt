<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinctive and thematically consistent, but psychological complexity remains abstract due to excessive metaphor obscuring concrete motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot progression relies too heavily on poetic abstraction; cause/effect relationships between the bookmark's "crossings" and the ice sculpture climax feel underdeveloped within the compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured but occasionally self-indulgent; some setting elements (subterranean waterfall's "hush") prioritize lyrical effect over functional world-building that could clarify how this society operates.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor ("bookmarks binding like prayer hands") and conceptual resonance between personal death wish and societal fragility create lingering impact despite structural flaws.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("energy flows through stone, blood, rumor") that feels self-consciously literary rather than organically imagined; hidden society trope lacks differentiation from generic fantasy conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story exhibits intellectual ambition and atmospheric cohesion but struggles with pragmatic narrative mechanics in its compressed formâ€”original concepts overwhelm character and plot legibility.</comment>
