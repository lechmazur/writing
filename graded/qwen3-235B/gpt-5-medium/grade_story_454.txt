<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (gaining acceptance) is clear, but "reckless smuggler" trait feels more symbolic than psychological; emotional logic is abstract rather than humanly specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through action beats and mirrored revelations, but cause/effect in the surreal elements feels occasionally imposed rather than organic within the constrained structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric setting realized through potent sensory paradoxes (neon despair, breathing darkness) creates compelling atmosphere that thematically anchors the narrative's emotional contradictions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric density and lyrical tension between control/chaos produce lingering resonance; the "pressed hope as currency" motif particularly haunting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains moments of near-overwrought imagery; emotional subtext implied through spectacle rather than embodied experience feels purposeful rather than accidental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements function collectively as a metaphorical system rather than checklist, though some aspects (watch alarms) feel structurally perfunctory rather than organically integrated.</comment>
