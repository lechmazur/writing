<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character actions align with "sharp gentleness," but inner psychology remains abstract, relying more on poetic imagery than concrete emotional truth. The matchmaker's guilt lacks anchoring in relatable human stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows from button discovery to resolution, but the interstellar mystery’s mechanics feel intangible. The "repaired frequencies" conclusion lacks concrete narrative payoff, leaning too heavily on metaphor to satisfy structural coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Breathless, immersive world-building with zeppelin physics (hissing vents, channel-skimming motion) and celestial scale (constellations-as-stitches) merges seamlessly with thematic concerns about communication across distances.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Each metaphor (lamenting equations, books as unmet frequencies) reverberates with existential longing. The ending’s "wait until wind finishes reading" encapsulates the theme’s paradoxical urgency/patience in connecting disparate truths.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avant-garde style risks alienating readers (“gaslight globes,” “constellations looped like stitches” lean into cyberpunk-adjacent familiarities), but emotional subtext emerges through tactile details (button’s “hollow as paused breath,” mending frequencies as grief-work).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While some metaphors strain under their weight (“veins teaching pages to ripple”), the integration of cosmic scale with intimate human rituals (matching, mourning) creates lingering resonance that transcends its schematic elements.</comment>
