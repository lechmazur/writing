<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character has intriguing traits but lacks emotional depth; the professional scapegoat premise is novel but motivation to decode symbols feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded, with minimal concrete behaviors revealing inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a cryptic narrative arc with poetic logic, but pacing feels compressed - key revelations about identity emerge suddenly without emotional payoff, and the connection between the ledger and skylight climax requires more narrative scaffolding for coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cloud city's vaporous materiality and library setting create immersive, original atmosphere where atmosphere itself becomes thematic; the metallic washer's physicality grounds the ethereal setting, and the skybridges/maintenance cupola maintain consistent environmental logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Literary devices transcend ornamentation - the 'smudges on souls' metaphor develops into a system of moral accounting, the palimpsest conceit carries thematic weight, and the final ascent into the sky realizes the scapegoat's existential paradox through tightly controlled lyricism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes but exhibits AI-patterned prose rhythms (e.g., thrice-repeated 'robustly delicate' phrasing); metaphors like weather-as-institutional-corruption feel strikingly new, though occasional phrasal recycling dilutes tension between poetic abstraction and narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story succeeds as moody conceptual exercise but struggles to balance element density - the intricate symbolic web risks feeling artificially constructed rather than organically emerging, though the final monogram revelation ties many threads together with haunting efficiency.</comment>
