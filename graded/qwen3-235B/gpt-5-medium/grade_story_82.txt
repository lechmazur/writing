<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's "analytically playful" approach and desire to "speak with" rather than "for" the orchard are consistent, but psychological depth remains secondary to poetic abstraction; voice leans heavily on metaphor rather than human emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear mythopoeic structure maintains coherence through recurring motifs (tooth/orchard/dialogue) and thematic bookending in sunrise frames, though some causal connections between cellar chamber revelations and city resolution require narrative inference.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid synesthetic world-building creates immersive dissonance between decaying organic orchard and crystalline hub; the "antique chill" of the cave and "wormholes of gossip" stand out as atmospheric masterstrokes that fuse concept and mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional metaphor density ("leaves rehearse gossip," "wallpaper peels like scabbed maps") creates haunting resonance; theme of silenced voices finding articulation emerges organically through structural parallels between orchard's memory and child's disappearance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rare moments of over-lavish description ("gleaming with a promise the orchard begged me to hear") flirt with purple prose, but frequent subversive imagery ("contracts between settlers and trees, signatures made with sap and breath") demonstrates humanistic invention beneath formal daring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transcends "cursed orchard" trope through quantum-poetic synthesis of ecological memory and bureaucratic futurism; the central metaphor of translating non-human testimony gains haunting weight through disciplined metaphorical architecture despite compact form.</comment>
