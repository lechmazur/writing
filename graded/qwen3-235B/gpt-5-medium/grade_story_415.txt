<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Limited exploration of how synesthetic ability shapes personality or choices; motivation to sever ties is stated but not deeply dramatized through actions beyond symbolic gestures with objects.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fragmented arc resists traditional plot but loses emotional stakes; cause-effect between tasting memories and achieving forgiveness remains abstract, weakening narrative cohesion despite poetic momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exquisite atmospheric cohesion—synthetic ivy and yodeling valley create dissonant beauty; sensory details (spruce resin, iron innings) etch the setting into character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and thematic resonance (forgiveness as culinary alchemy) elevate the piece, but over-reliance on abstract imagery obscures core emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original voice avoids cliché but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction; subverts chef/healing tropes through synesthesia; some phrases veer toward self-conscious lyricism rather than purposeful precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Elements combine inventively but strain under weight of dense symbolism; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful; lingers emotionally but lacks structural backbone.</grade>
