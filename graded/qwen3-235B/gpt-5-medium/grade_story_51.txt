<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong voice and some emotional complexity, but past violence lacks visceral weight; motivation is clear but redemption feels more symbolic than earned through lived experience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Subtle progression from solitude to connection works economically, with Mara's arrival providing emotional punctuation rather than conventional conflict. Circular structure mirrors the character's struggle.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting achieves immersive cohesion through tactile details like ozone and penny-metal taste. Electric garden metaphor permeates narrative while retaining eerie specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Highly wrought lyricism carries emotional resonance without showiness. Spark metaphors function as living symbols of guilt and hope. Ending delivers thematic weight through gesture rather than exposition.</comment>
