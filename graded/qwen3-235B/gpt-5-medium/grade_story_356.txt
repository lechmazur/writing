<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's wryness and aloofness are present but feel more as poetic descriptors than deeply integrated motivations; actions align with traits but lack emotional grounding or complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Predicate action (vanishing "what ifs") drives the resolution, but lacks traditional plot progression; poetic momentum substitutes for narrative structure within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (chalk dust, humming engines, tactile silence) create immersive atmosphere; the cargo hold's industrial decay contrasts beautifully with cosmic imagery and conceptual themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (time as gas, harbor, chalk) are fresh and resonant; ending resonates with philosophical weight; quiet cloud corridor as emotional subtext elevates craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical phrasing occasionally risks pretension but mostly feels purposeful; avoids genre tropes through unconventional time manipulation; tone consistency elevated by textured emotional ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Element integration feels symbiotic; brief form enhances existential brevity; thematic throughline about healing through selective forgetting lingers effectively.</comment>
