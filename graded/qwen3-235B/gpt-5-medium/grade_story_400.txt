<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to avoid memories through ritual is clear but could deepen emotional layers; "dour amusement" is inconsistently rendered through sparse narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves emotional resolution but lacks narrative tension; pacing lulls in middle as repetitive rituals overshadow subtle progression towards confronting silence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Pervasive, haunting atmosphere with crystalline imagery of ice and frost; spatial tension between orchard and crevasse transcends literal description into existential metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Richly poetic language elevates thematic exploration of memory and solitude; subtext about healing through ritual is poignant despite minimal conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("trees snacking like old gods") sparkle but occasional ornate phrasing ("calcified breath") risks obscuring emotional clarity; avoids genre tropes through conceptual abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements serve story thematically but lack structural integration; atmosphere lingers more than plot, yet succeeds as meditative character piece.</comment>
