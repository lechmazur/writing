<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weak character interiority beyond symbolic gestures; motivation to "learn secrets of magic" remains vague despite poetic flourishes; character’s obsessive collecting drives the plot but lacks psychological depth or evolution beyond thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on abstract revelations over causal logic; unresolved tension between bootleg excavation and garnet’s magic; pacing stumbles in compressed arc, with pivotal moments (garnet discovery, climactic performance) feeling rushed or arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile decay (dust-caked ferris wheels, pedal-powered carnival) and melancholic nostalgia; tone occasionally overrides practical logic of setting (e.g., unexplained mechanics of bootleg recordings in a low-tech carnival).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor-soaked prose elevates thematic cohesion (magic as "postal system for feelings"), but reliance on abstract statements ("I wept with bold vulnerability") risks telling over showing; ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic payoff, not character.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in fusing magic, philately, and bootlegs is undercut by familiar melancholic "hidden artist" trope; lush imagery borders on overwriting (e.g., "slow lungs breathing through dust") but maintains stylistic consistency; avoids outright clichés through strange juxtapositions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements (stamps, carnival) are thematically bound but narratively disparate; brevity both enhances mythic tone and exposes plot gaps; style elevates material but cannot fully mask structural fragility; lingers as a mood more than a story.</comment>
