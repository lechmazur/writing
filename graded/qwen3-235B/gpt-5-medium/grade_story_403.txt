<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is archetypal, motivations clear but under-explored; actions align with traits, but inner conflict remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves fluidly through surreal beats, but the 500-word arc feels compressed; thematic cohesion salvages structural compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (e.g., "ink writing backwards," "shelves chiming") create an immersive, mythic atmosphere that amplifies the knight’s journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (tides as miracles, seashell as limit-marker) layer subtext; the ending’s thematic payoff lingers, though emotional beats lean poetic over visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids cloying clichés (e.g., "tides in robes" as librarians); occasionally veers into ornate phrasing, but originality in metaphors sustains freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story transcends its constraints to deliver a resonant, self-contained myth; elements serve the theme without feeling imposed, though some linguistic density may distance readers.</comment>
