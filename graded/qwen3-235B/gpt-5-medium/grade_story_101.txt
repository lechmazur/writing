<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Characters function more as metaphors than individuals; the landlord serves as a cryptic symbol but lacks psychological depth or evolution. The narrator's voice is poetic but doesn't reveal cohesive motivation or specific traits beyond abstract receptivity to the surreal environment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The narrative prioritizes linguistic density over plot; abstract actions like "designing rooms" lack concrete stakes or progression. The parade detour's connection to the studio's work remains symbolic rather than structurally integral, undermining traditional plot coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is meticulously crafted through tactile details (tea, drafts) and temporal ambiguity. The studio's paradoxical stillness contrasting with parades' interruption creates immersive tension. Sensory language evokes a mythic present-past hybrid effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (rooms as forgiveness, bee as enduring labor) resonate thematically. The closing line achieves emotional resonance through paradoxical action ("refused forgetting"), but some poetic abstraction risks alienating narrative engagement. Subtext about creation/destruction is potent but unevenly balanced with surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weaves original symbolic systems but occasionally indulges in ornate personification ("fossils dreaming"). Avoids genre tropes through linguistic invention, though some phrases border on precious ("sunrise-shaped recess"). Emotional nuance emerges through subtext (e.g., armored sweetness) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</comment>Despite structural looseness, the story achieves thematic unity through recurring motifs. Length feels deliberate, using compression to amplify mystery. Certain elements (bee pin, parade detour) feel authorially orchestrated rather than organically integrated into the narrative architecture.</comment>
