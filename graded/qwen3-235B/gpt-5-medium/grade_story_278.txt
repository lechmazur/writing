<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with poetic introspection but underdeveloped internal conflict; motivation to escape shaped by external pressures rather than psychological depth</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure and dust-as-trope progression work but feel slightly forced; climax's disappearance lacks emotional payoff despite strong setup</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory immersion (hosewater hiss, dust choreography) but timeframes (car washing) and intrigue webs clash with character introspection</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Breathtaking use of metaphor (dust-as-espionage, light-as-liberation) with multi-layered subtext about surveillance and performative servitude; ending resonates thematically</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative language avoids clich√©s but occasional overdetermined imagery ("light rehearses with me") borders on poetic self-indulgence</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements combine with unexpected synergy despite occasional thematic over-reach; lingering impact lies in conceptual questions about perception vs reality</comment>
