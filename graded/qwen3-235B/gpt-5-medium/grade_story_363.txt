<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has haunting depth but lacks full motivation payoff; grief and ledger duty feel under-connected despite poetic imagery like the silent bell.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coheres through thematic rhythm rather than action, but the arc relies too heavily on atmospheric gaps rather than character-driven progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, clashing textures (grease-stained nostalgia vs. sleek automation) immerse the reader in a world where technology’s advance feels like a slow suffocation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("laughter inked by tremors") and recursive structure create emotional resonance far exceeding the literal narrative; the bell-as-mourning device lingers viscerally.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids formula through unconventional syntax ("clinkless weight") and existential metaphysical logic—nightmares-as-mechanism feels daringly human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically; the parade bookends the story like a funeral dirge, and the Ledger’s mission transcends gimmickry to explore memory’s role in resisting cold progress.</comment>
