<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character transformation is present but feels rushed; Kaito’s shift from arrogance to introspection lacks sufficient behavioral nuance. The "doubtfully confident" trait surfaces briefly but doesn’t fully integrate with his core identity as a swordsman.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a redemption arc but strains coherence in the word limit. The leap from disdain for the tapestry to embracing song as a duel method feels undermotivated. Pacing balances atmosphere and action but falters in emotional escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is evocative (ink-stained courtyard, sensory details) and atmospherically aligned with themes of fading tradition. Timeframe "between breaths" effectively amplifies tension but underutilized narratively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (tapestry as legacy, song vs. sword) adds subtext. Ending resolves inner conflict satisfyingly but relies on familiar "power of art" tropes. Emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract phrasing in key moments.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains predictable contrasts (battle-ready vs. gentle) and some overly ornate prose. The choice to use a song for a duel has originality, but character reasoning occasionally feels schematic rather than human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story manages to incorporate all assigned elements cohesively. Brief length serves the thematic focus but limits depth. The interplay between arrogance and vulnerability suggests thoughtful construction.</comment>
