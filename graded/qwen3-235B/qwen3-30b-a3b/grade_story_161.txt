<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's grief and background are suggestive but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient emotional grounding; traits like punctuality serve symbolism over consistent behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is serviceable but relies on abrupt revelations (wife's death, conspiracy) that strain coherence; connections between peacock patterns and espionage feel contrived within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting blends mundane (orchardist) and surreal (conspiracy facility) but lacks deeper integration; sensory details (crunching gravel, iridescence) are underdeveloped for immersive atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief and conspiracy intertwine effectively; metaphors (feathers as code) add symbolic depth, but emotional beats are occasionally stated rather than demonstrated through character nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s with unique premise (peacock ciphers) but relies on under-subverted tropes (dead spouse's secret work) and occasional overwrought phrasing; tone shifts between sardonic and somber without full cohesion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements unevenly; some (seal, grief) are pivotal while others (setting, timeframe) feel decorative, leaving cohesion reliant on stronger integrations rather than systemic innovation.</comment>
