<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's nervousness and motivation are clear but underexplored; emotional depth and nuanced reactions are lacking despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure is mostly coherent with a clear arc, but pacing issues and abrupt ending reduce impact within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with bioluminescent details, but sensory integration unevenly supports the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphor use and thematic consistency, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract over-descriptive prose and an underdeveloped subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some original elements (bacteria-powered city) shine, but clichéd phrases ("frayed resolve"), predictable arcs, and overwritten passages undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but inconsistently woven; the story’s brevity works for lyrical moments but weakens thematic and emotional depth.</comment>
