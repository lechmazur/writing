<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's "grace" and "mindful scattering" are superficial traits; motivations for seeking escape are underexplored, with inconsistent internal logic about the sword's symbolic role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arc structure present but strained—awakening of ancient force feels abrupt, resolution hastily shifts from "trap" to "lesson" without earned emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Jarring contradictions: bird songs underwater, coral gardens with telescopes create a muddled atmosphere; sensory details are overwrought and arbitrary rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "kelp-like thoughts") and resonant themes of freedom vs. responsibility shine, but ending's abrupt moralizing undercuts complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Richly original imagery occasionally slips into ornate abstraction; avoids clichés through surreal juxtapositions (scavenging cosmic signals in drowned TVs) but risks pretension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition fails to cohere—assigned elements clash mechanically; underwater setting and bird songs create logical dissonance that undermines thematic unity.</comment>
