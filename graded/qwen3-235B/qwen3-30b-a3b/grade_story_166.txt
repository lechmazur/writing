<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solemnly silly tone adds depth, but the caretaker’s ghostly nature lacks emotional grounding; motivation drives plot but remains under-explored thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Concise arc balances ritual failure and acceptance, but pivotal shifts (e.g., geothermal decay) feel abrupt without clearer causal progression; resolution ties to premise effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking juxtaposition of ice/steam creates vivid atmosphere, but underutilized sensory details in secondary elements (e.g., orchard’s decay beyond visual cues) limit full immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (straw, frostbitten birds) and cyclical structure elevate theme of impermanence; subtext about communication vs. control resonates; slightly diluted by occasionally ornate prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic phrasing (straw as artifact) and clichés (ghosts as tragic rather than purposeful), but tonal shifts occasionally feel forced; emotional resonance emerges through symbolic actions more than character interiority.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements synergize into a contemplative whole; brevity enhances thematic focus; closure feels earned yet open to reflection, though minor pacing hiccups prevent perfection.</comment>
