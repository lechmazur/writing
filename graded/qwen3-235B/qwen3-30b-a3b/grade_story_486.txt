<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth; motivation implied through action but not fully explored. Clumsily dexterous trait only superficially tied to characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is linear but feels rushed; abrupt transition from crowd chaos to pantomime confessions lacks narrative momentum. Cohesion between key elements weakened by compressed structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evoke atmosphere through sensory details (burnt herbs, fractured light) establishes mood but relies on genre clich√©s. The witch's room and square lack distinctive spatial logic or temporal specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphor usage (silence as language), but emotional impact remains on thematic surface. The ending's philosophical resonance is undercut by underdeveloped psychological realism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Some purple prose tendencies (e.g., "symphony of guilt"), but original conceptual framework (practical illusion, sound-based retribution) elevates above formulaic patterns. Human nuance occasionally surfaces in character-object interactions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Element integration varies; core concept and motivation strongly drive narrative while timeframe and setting feel arbitrarily assigned. Lingering thematic resonance in silence/communication dialectic partially compensates for tonal inconsistency.</comment>
