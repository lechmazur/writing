<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Internal conflict of repression vs. creation is palpable but underdeveloped; motivations hinted through dialogue yet lack visceral depth; transformation from silence to defiance feels abrupt without grounding in concrete emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure bookended by silence and awakening works in tight word count; pacing stumbles during stranger confrontation which disrupts cause-effect flow; abrupt resolution sacrifices nuanced exploration of thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-drenched atmosphere masterfully evokes decayed urban surrealism; setting's sentient quality mirrors poet's internal state through overgrown ivy and oppressive silence; perfume bottle's tactile allure strengthens object-setting symbiosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (e.g., "scent blooming like a secret") and poetic imagery elevate narrative; tension between cosmic/mortal dualities provides intellectual heft; ending's catharsis feels earned but lacks emotional marrow beneath lush prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Many elements verge on clich√© (e.g., ruins reclaimed by nature, mysterious stranger); overwritten phrases ("ash-tasting words") distract; character psychology remains schematic; atmospheric cohesion compensates for but doesn't eliminate formulaic undertones.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Weaving of required elements shows deliberate craftsmanship, particularly perfume bottle's symbolic role; conceptual framework remains intact yet overly dependent on atmospheric scaffolding; memorable cadence without lasting visceral impact.</comment>
