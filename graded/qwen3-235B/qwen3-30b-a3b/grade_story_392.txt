<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of emotional depth in internal conflict; motivations are present but underexplored. Transition from skeptic to believer feels abrupt without sufficient nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc but gaps in logical connections (storm sounds ↔ rideshare lines). Pacing constrained by word limit occasionally disrupts causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (old paper, static, tactile thimbles) create haunting atmosphere. Setting actively shapes theme of decayed memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance (thimbles as vessels) and thematic cohesion (ephemeral vs. archive). Ending lingers with poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in concept (digitized memory ↔ tangible relics) but some ornate phrasing risks self-indulgence (e.g., “loud silence”). Mostly avoids clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exceptional cohesion and thematic depth. Falls short of transcendent impact due to underdeveloped character psychology and abrupt thematic pivots.</comment>
