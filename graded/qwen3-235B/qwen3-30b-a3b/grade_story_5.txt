<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's guarded nature and 'theoretically whimsical' methods are underexplored; motivations are conceptually clear but lack depth in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Begins with mystery but the resolution feels abrupt; cause/effect between analyzing nightmares and restoring purpose lacks nuanced progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (hum, glow, decay) establish mood, but the power plant's industrial history and drowned civilization ties remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and theme of humility vs. dominance resonate, but emotional stakes could be more viscerally "shown" rather than poetically stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Imaginative premise diluted by occasionally overwrought phrasing ("tremors in her soul") and predictable contrasts between decay/rebirth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't fully integrated; the length works but the arc's emotional payoff feels slightly detached from its rich symbolism.</comment>
