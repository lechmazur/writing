<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc is complete but pacing feels uneven; the supernatural leap to the starlit expanse lacks sufficient grounding for full narrative satisfaction within the constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vibrant originality in conceptualizing wisdom as tangible fruit and mind as landscape; occasional ornate phrasing risks overshadowing emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Element integration is frequently ingenious but occasionally forced; brevity serves poetic resonance better than psychological complexity.</comment>
