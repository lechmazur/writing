<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical nature is stated but not fully embodied through actions; motivations tied to rebellion are abstract rather than visceral. The disowned name as a motif shows potential but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Decrypting vows drives the plot but feels overly symbolic with underdeveloped stakes; the arc from doubt to reluctant leadership is compressed. Pacing falters in connecting abstract concepts to tangible events.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nano-forest’s bioluminescent atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently tied to character or plot; "angry peace" tone is evocative yet unevenly sustained. Sensory details impress but lack integration with narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "transmuting grief into growth" resonate thematically, but emotional beats rely on poetic abstraction over concrete subtext. Ending connects to beginning but lacks earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Combines dystopian and rebellion tropes with speculative elements but fails to subvert either. Some fresh imagery (e.g., rust/rain language) exists, but occasional purple prose and predictable themes suggest partial originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion falters under scrutiny—encrypting vows in a diary feels forced. Writing style has moments of distinction but struggles to unify fragmented elements into a seamless whole. Lingering impression is more stylistic than thematically profound.</comment>
