<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation for mastering reality feels abstract and underexplored despite immortal context. Actions align with assigned traits but fail to humanize or complicate the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has circular structure and thematic cohesion but lacks narrative drive. The digitization method is conceptually intriguing yet insufficiently connected to cause-effect progression; pacing meanders despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually evocative setting with bioluminescence and mole people creates immersive atmosphere. Symbolism (light vs. dark) enhances mood, though sensory details remain selectively deployed rather than consistently layered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "light as a burden" and the headlamp’s final placement convey thematic resonance. Ending is poetic but emotionally distant; subtext about immortality’s cost is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clichés but has uneven prose quality. Some phrases ("whispers of possibility") border on overused tropes. Emotional subtext exists but leans on abstraction rather than concrete characterization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but unevenly weighted. The story’s brevity enhances atmospheric density but constrains emotional payoff. Combines concepts with structural purpose and leaves thematic questions, albeit shallowly.</comment>
