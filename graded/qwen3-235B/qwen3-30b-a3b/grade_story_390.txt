<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; motivations implied through symbolic actions rather than psychological depth. "Figuratively literal" dialogue fails to establish distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arc exists but feels compressed; cause-effect relationship between peony amalgamation and palace transformation lacks emotional payoff within strict word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion in palace decay and botanical details, though specific historical connections to Chinese architecture remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphor-drenched prose provokes contemplation but sometimes overwhelms thematic clarity. Ending's philosophical question lacks character-based emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally slips into self-indulgent lyrical excess. Butterfly motif cleverly bridges time, while "amalgamate" feels conceptually forced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Element cohesion achieves poetic unity but falls short of transcendent impact. Brief format serves atmosphere better than narrative development.</comment>
