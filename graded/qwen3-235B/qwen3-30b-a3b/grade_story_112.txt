<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve recipes is clear, but lacks psychological depth; transformation feels symbolic rather than earned through observable growth or nuanced reasoning. "Factually imaginative" trait remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear progression exists (aimless wanderer to awakened purpose), but disjointed transitions (e.g., hopscotch glowing, archive shuddering) lack narrative causality; pacing prioritizes lyricism over plot coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (ink-stained handkerchief, melting snowflake) create mood, but "archive" setting inconsistently ties to culinary themes; mournful elation conveyed through metaphors rather than embodied atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (recipes as cultural survival, handkerchief as ancestral bridge) carry thematic weight; subtextual layers about erasure and remembrance resonate, though abstract prose occasionally hinders emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylistically ambitious with original imagery (e.g., "whispers of seeds"), but veers toward ornate abstraction; avoids direct clich√©s but risks alienating readers through dense, repetitive symbolism (e.g., "seeds of vigilance").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive thematically (cultural preservation), but narrative momentum sacrificed for poetic flourishes; elements (handkerchief, hopscotch) feel conceptually linked rather than organically integrated into character or plot.</comment>
