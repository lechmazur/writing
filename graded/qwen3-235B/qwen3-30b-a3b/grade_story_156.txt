<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character development feels surface-level; internal conflict between duty/resilience isn't fully embodied through actions. Motivation to liberalize trade is present but lacks layered reasoning. "Counterpoint of hearts" concept isn't convincingly translated into psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has vague arc but lacks clear climax or resolution within word constraints. Thematic bookending with flock/starlings attempts coherence but feels forced. Pacing alternates between lingering descriptions and abrupt thematic shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eerie salt mine setting rendered through vivid sensory details (salt-strewn corridors, faded mural) creates immersive atmosphere. The "beauty carved from desolation" paradox supports thematic tension. Bus timeframe only weakly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (flock as uncertainty mirror, key as bridge) but subtext remains abstract. Writing style is poetic yet emotionally distant. Central tension exists but dialogue feels philosophical rather than character-driven. Ending lacks finality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occasional vivid images undercut by overwritten phrases ("living tapestry of chaos and order"). Emotional nuance often stated rather than demonstrated (e.g., "boldly timid rhythm"). Avoids major tropes but contains predictable symbolic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story feels concept-driven rather than organically cohesive. Assigned elements technically present but uneven in narrative integration. Formal precision exists but lacks urgency needed for prestigious publication. Leaves conceptual questions without earned emotional payoff.</comment>
