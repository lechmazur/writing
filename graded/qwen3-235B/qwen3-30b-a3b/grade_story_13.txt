<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation is stated but not fully dramatized. Solemnity remains surface-level, no distinct voice to humanize the journey.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels compressed. Pacing leans poetic over dramatic tension; cause-effect ties between elements are implied rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and immersive. Sensory details (shifting sands, humming lab) and symbolic settings (clock tower/garden) create a haunting, cohesive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subtext about resilience and adaptation elevates the narrative. Strong imagery and metaphor (garden as evolutionary pulse), but emotional stakes feel abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in combining alchemy, decay, and evolution, but some phrases ("paradox," "whispered riddles") tip into formulaic lyricism. Avoids clich√©s but risks pretension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements tightly, but cohesion leans on poetic abstraction rather than narrative necessity. Leaves a thematic residue, but impact feels curated, not earned.</comment>
