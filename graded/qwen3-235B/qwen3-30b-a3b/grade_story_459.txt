<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's emotional journey is well-rendered through symbolic interaction with the crown and ghosts, though her technical skills as an elevator technician remain underexplored in shaping personality or actions. Motivation to let go is consistent but could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from discovery to resolution, but the rapid progression between key plot points (e.g., finding photo, ghost dissolution) feels compressed. Pacing issues emerge in the climax, where emotional payoff is slightly undercut by the need for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (salt-petrichor scent, crunch of sand) and symbolic sand castles create immersive atmosphere. However, the lab's function and connection to the ghosts could be more explicitly tied to the setting's physicality for stronger cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and lyrical prose elevate the story. The dissonance of silence as emotional paradox resonates deeply. Theme of fragmented memory and reconciliation is powerfully conveyed, though some abstract concepts border on overwrought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original use of sand castles as altars and the flower crown as a memory key subverts typical ghost-story tropes. Avoids clich√© through poetic specificity; however, the elevator-repair motif could be more inventively integrated for stronger uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce effectively into a thematically resonant whole, though the protagonist's profession feels more like setting than narrative engine. The concise structure enhances focus on emotional core, leaving a lingering metaphysical impression.</comment>
