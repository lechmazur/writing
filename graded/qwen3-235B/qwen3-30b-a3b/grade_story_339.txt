<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Intrusive abstraction undermines character clarity; motivations hinted at but obscured by excessive metaphor, leaving emotional contours insufficiently defined despite evocative objects suggesting repressed history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented chronology and elliptical action create tension between poetic stasis and narrative progression; resolution feels more atmospheric than structural, with symbolic gestures substituting for concrete causal arcs.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Liquid light and industrial decay create hauntingly layered atmosphere where every sensory detail serves dual purpose as memory shard and emotional register, though occasional over-saturation muddies spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ritualistic object placement generates haunting subtext about legacy and erasure, yet emotional weight sometimes collapses into linguistic excess rather than crystallizing through precise, embodied action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Luscious decay trope fatigue sets in; metaphors (mirrors, echoes) feel archaeologically excavated rather than freshly experienced, with occasional adverbial flourishes diluting visceral impact amidst flashes of originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Formal elegance salvages structural fragility; elements function more as poetic consonance than narrative necessity in a piece whose truest conflict exists between language's ambition and emotional accessibility.</comment>
