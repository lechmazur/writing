<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character psychology feels thinly sketched; Lila's doubts and resolve are stated rather than revealed through nuanced actions. Internal conflict lacks visceral specificity despite the brooch anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists structurally but feels compressed - the pivotal mural agreement occurs abruptly without sufficient artistic resistance or emotional beats. Church bells add structure but their symbolic weight remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements like "cheerful gloom" and the chalk cliffs create strong initial mood, but sensory details often generalize rather than specifically ground (e.g. "echoing colony's history" of Mateo's brushstrokes lacks concrete description).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of tradition/evolution resonate, but excessive abstraction ("interconnected paths," "cheerful gloom") outweighs embodied storytelling. Ends with thematic clarity but underdeveloped emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on artistic utopia clich√©s with overly polished metaphors ("key to lost rituals"). Emotional register remains literary-generic rather than distinctive, with some purple prose ("melody of cheerful gloom").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but formulaically. Short form works conceptually but lacks narrative urgency; thematic concerns overshadow character specificity and concrete worldbuilding.</comment>
