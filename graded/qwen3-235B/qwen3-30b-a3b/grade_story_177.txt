<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's rebellious nature is present but underdeveloped; motivation to preserve stories lacks emotional depth or personal stakes, relying on symbolic resonance over human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal logic holds but pacing feels rushed; the labyrinth's shifting structure and rapid resolution create a disjointed midpoint despite a clear beginning/middle/end arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details create an immersive, eerie atmosphere; the giant's bookshelf and resonance chamber vividly enhance the story’s metaphysical tone, though some elements (e.g., rib-pipes) strain internal consistency.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and symbolism elevate the narrative; the theme of resistance through storytelling resonates, but emotions are occasionally stated rather than demonstrated, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés with inventive concepts, but leans on familiar "rebel vs. regime" tropes; prose is lyrical yet occasionally veers into ornate abstraction that obscures nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack individual depth; the story’s ambition and style suggest higher potential, but execution prioritizes symbolism over fully realized character or conflict.</comment>
