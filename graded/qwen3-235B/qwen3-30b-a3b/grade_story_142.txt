<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's conflict between past and present is evident, but emotional depth feels surface-level; motivations are clear but lack nuanced internal exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing fluctuates; some plot beats (roller coaster's activation, spectral dialogue) feel abrupt despite logical cause-and-effect, slightly undermining cohesion within word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting evokes rich gothic atmosphere through precise sensory details; haunted elements align with themes but parallel timelines are underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink as legacy) convey theme effectively, but dialogue with indeterminate child veers into clich√©; ending lacks sufficient emotional payoff despite symbolic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with botanical surrealism, but "walk as rebellion" device feels contrived; linguistic precision balances ornate descriptions without descending into purple prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion despite occasional narrative convenience; elements serve theme but structural brevity occasionally sacrifices emotional complexity demanded by elite literary standards.</comment>
