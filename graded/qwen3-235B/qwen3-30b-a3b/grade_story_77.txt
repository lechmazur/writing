<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's introversion is stated but not embodied through specific behaviors; her empathic abilities drive the plot but lack psychological depth. The outcasts' redemption feels abrupt, unearned by gradual character evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum stumbles between mystical revelations and action. The "reassembling fragments" method is symbolic but poorly operationalized. Sudden pirate conversions lack narrative groundwork, undercutting emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Space pirate hideout atmosphere is vividly sketched through sensory dissonance (nebulae intoxication vs. rusted corridors) but could deeper integrate with themes. The asteroid's "core" remains underexploited spatial metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery ("mountain wisdom of a world long buried") creates thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by abstractions. Ending's declarative statements ("This is not a weapon") undercut subtler symbolic work. Subtext remains superficially treated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose veers between lyrical precision and purple patches ("damp breath of the space pirate hideout"). Metaphors (marionette as "vessel") are conceptually rich but mechanically rendered. Emotional beats are often told rather than shown through character embodiment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements combine cleverly but mechanically. The narrative arc feels preordained by thematic goals rather than organic character logic. Lingering questions about "mountain wisdom" remain unproductive rather than provocative.</comment>
