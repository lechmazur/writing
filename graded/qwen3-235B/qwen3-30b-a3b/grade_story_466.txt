<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paper-thin characterization; traits like "cunning" and "morally ambiguous" are stated but rarely demonstrated through specific actions or internal contradictions that feel organic rather than checklist-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Gears grind audibly between sections; the grocery store-to-tower transition lacks narrative bridge, while the ending’s "latent energy" feels like thematic bluffing rather than earned resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Visually rich but inert; the "smoke and dust" atmosphere lacks emotional resonance, functioning as scenery rather than an existential battleground between discovery and consequence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strains toward mythic weight but never lands a clear thematic punch; the xerograph’s revelation and tower’s "dormant system" promise more than they deliver in symbolic heft or emotional tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose oscillates between arresting phrases ("tactile bridge to a world where seeds held secrets") and dime-store mysticism; the "gentle chaos" tone veers into self-parody through over-sentimentalized verbs like "gnawing doubt." </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Assembled from compelling parts but never becomes more than their sum; the grocery-store framing device hints at commentary on consumerist malaise, but this thread unravels in favor of hollow mystery-mongering.</comment>
