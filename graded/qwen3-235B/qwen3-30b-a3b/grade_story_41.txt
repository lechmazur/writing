<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but surface-level; cosmic powers lack integration into personality beyond plot function. "Choosing what to carry" feels underexplored thematically despite pivotal role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arc exists within constraints but resolution feels abrupt. Ritual's mechanics and consequences lack explanatory groundwork, relying on vague cosmic imagery rather than coherent cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid industrial decay and supernatural elements create immersive tension. Atmosphere compensates for thin world-building through precise details like rust scent and shifting gargoyles, though socioeconomic context remains unexamined.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors elevate thematic resonance ("ritual as compass"). Ending satisfies on poetic level but lacks emotional specificity; cosmic imagery occasionally verges on abstraction without human grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Subverts thresholds-as-choice trope with ritual-as-liberation twist, but cosmic powers and academic wildness feel like checklist elements. Prose balances lyrical beauty with mechanical repetition; gargoyles as symbols better developed than utilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not structurally. Ritual serves as narrative scaffold rather than organic growth. Lingering questions about ancestral legacy and cosmic energy remain unexplored but intentionally so within constraints.</comment>
