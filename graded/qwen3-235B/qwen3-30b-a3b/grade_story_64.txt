<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks psychological depth; motivation ties to theme but internal conflicts remain underexplored despite poetic description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has circular structure with thematic resolution, but pacing tension fluctuates; the judge’s trial feels underdeveloped within the compressed narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory textures, though the floating marketplace’s thematic integration feels superficial compared to the deeper focus on the floor’s scuffs and scale.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (scale/floor fractures as cost of immortality) elevates the narrative; ending resonates conceptually though emotional impact remains controlled rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with fresh imagery (cracked scuffs as ciphers), but occasional ornate phrasing (“wild, unyielding light”) risks veering into stylization over substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively orbit core themes, but tight word limits strain resolution of secondary motifs (e.g., judge’s role); concise yet feels like a fragment of a larger mythos.</comment>
