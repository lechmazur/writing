<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character’s rebellious nature is mentioned but not deeply demonstrated in actions; motivation of “defying the void” feels abstract and inconsistently embodied, relying on exposition over nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to revelation, but the transformation and departure feel rushed; the tight arc is cohesive, though the brevity slightly undercuts emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and immersive, with rust, ivy, and shifting light creating a haunting mood that mirrors the poet’s quest; sensory details are precise and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling uses rich metaphor (e.g., “delicate undoing”) and subtext about memory, with a lyrical style that enhances theme; some surface-level exposition detracts from deeper immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés, but certain phrases (“scents of forgotten time”) veer toward overused poeticism; the core concept’s abstract nature feels purposeful, though not entirely novel.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All elements integrate into a unified whole, with momentum driven by mystery and theme; the brevity amplifies urgency but leaves some implications lingering without full resolution.</comment>
