<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's stage fright and defiance of family lies are clear but thinly developed; motivations are present but lack concrete emotional anchoring despite poetic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through surreal imagery, but the tightly packed elements create a disjointed arc; the transformation of wildflowers into stars feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Orbital debris provides haunting atmosphere with vivid sensory details, though the vacuum-born laughter and toy symbolism strain immersion; tone and setting clash at points.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric resonance (wildflowers as legacy, key as heartbeat) elevates impact; ending's defiance feels emotionally cathartic but slightly underexplained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi and spiritual themes originally but relies on overfamiliar "breaking cycles" tropes; poetic language occasionally veers into purple prose without humanizing the protagonist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Holistic cohesion achieved through recurring motifs, though brevity sacrifices character depth; the exorcist's transformation lingers conceptually more than emotionally.</comment>
