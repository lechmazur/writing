<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned 'quietly loud' attribute lacks clear manifestation beyond superficial paradox; inconsistent reactions to objects like receipt undermine depth; motivations around reigniting connections remain vague and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure feels episodic and disjointed; action of infiltrating clubs serves little narrative function; transitions between abandoned spaces lack cohesion; resolution feels arbitrarily attached rather than earned through causal progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds in sensory fragments (mildew, flickering bulbs) but fails to integrate timeframe connection or create consistent spatial logic; setting details feel decorative rather than thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Creative use of metaphoric language ("haunted hashtags") and symbolic objects, but emotional resonance diluted by abstraction; ending lacks thematic precision; poetic moments don't coalesce into unified thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d phrases ("ghosts of laughter," "tapestry of memory") and pseudo-profound abstractions; inconsistent tone shifts suggest artificial pattern-matching rather than organic storytelling; metaphors often feel secondhand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements function as atmospheric props rather than narrative drivers; while conceptually ambitious, disjointed execution prevents cohesive thematic synthesis; memorable moments overshadowed by structural incoherence.</comment>
