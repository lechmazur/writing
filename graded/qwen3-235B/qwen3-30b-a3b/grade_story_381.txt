<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Surface-level traits (necromancy, baseball cap ritual) exist without psychological depth; motivations (map to preserve) lack concrete stakes or personal history; necromancer identity feels ornamental rather than integrated into action</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mapping mission provides clear through-line; tension between discovery and preservation gives narrative shape; pacing uneven in mid-section but cohesive bookends reinforce cyclical structure</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rich visual contrasts between crystalline cold and filmic nostalgia work well; inconsistently realized tech elements (scanner vs. necromancy) create tonal dissonance</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors linking light/refraction to memory/ephemerality carry thematic weight; emotional resonance diluted by overly explicative ending; atmospheric immersion outweighs psychological engagement</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>AI fingerprints in repetitive descriptors ("grain of a film reel," "echoes tangled in air") and contrived poeticisms; necromancer trope remains unchallenged; nostalgia-punk aesthetic shows promise but lacks subversive edge</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>Functional integration of elements but lacks transformative vision; brief length exploited for mood over substance; atmospheric linger lingers but thematic reach exceeds grasp</comment>
