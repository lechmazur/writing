<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation through inherited bowl and self-forgiveness are clear but lack psychological nuance; transformation feels rapid without sufficient emotional scaffolding for full resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot adheres to three-act structure within constraints; chamber discovery serves as organic escalation point. Pacing tightens at critical moments but resolution of eulogy analysis subplot feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (humming air, mosaic mirrors) create immersive atmosphere. Witch's chamber introduces fantastical element that strains narrative coherence slightly but enhances thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (kintsugi-bowl, reflective fractures) and emotionally resonant subtext elevate storytelling. Some transitions between realism and magical elements could benefit from additional tonal calibration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story feels purposefully concise; elements combine inventively to explore forgiveness. Lingering emotional impact achieved through symbolic depth rather than narrative complexity.</comment>
