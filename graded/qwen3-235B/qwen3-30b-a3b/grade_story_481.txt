<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivation stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; interactions lack emotional nuance or psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Abstract progression with fragmented cause-effect; thematic cohesion exists but lacks narrative momentum; forced transitions between hospital and forge undermine structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mechanical atmosphere without lived-in authenticity; sensory details too often generic (neon/stale air); contrasts between sterile futurism and forge's primitivism feel schematic rather than organic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Verdant surface prose lacks conceptual innovation; some fresh metaphors (dragonfly-as-map) undermined by reliance on familiar oppositions (order/chaos); atmosphere occasionally borders on self-conscious "literary" styling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; style prioritizes lyrical density over narrative urgency; conceptual richness remains more implied than realized within the compressed format.</comment>
