<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to break tradition is clear but lacks nuanced emotional complexity; her father’s underdeveloped role as a “wreck-diver ghost whisperer” feels symbolic but untethered from tangible character history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses linearly from discovery to resolution but strains credibility in the abrupt supernatural climax; the circular structure ties the beginning and end, though the pacing falters under the 500-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (peeling paint, mildew-laced air) masterfully evoke the carnival’s decaying grandeur; however, the interplay between the amber and the setting’s haunted atmosphere occasionally feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The metaphor of the “thawing heart” effectively conveys emotional liberation, but the theme of familial legacy is undercut by a saccharine finale; the rebellion lacks visceral impact despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing (“echoes of the dead in the creak of the Ferris wheel”); the amber’s dissolving insect and the ghostly father hint at originality but lean on familiar gothic tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements like the carousel and amber feel purposeful, yet the narrative’s reliance on abstract symbolism (e.g., the heart) overshadows grounded emotional resonance; the ending lingers thematically but lacks narrative boldness.</comment>
