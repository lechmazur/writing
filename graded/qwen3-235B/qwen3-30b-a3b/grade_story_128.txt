<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded; the fretful archer's transformation relies more on thematic intent than believable emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence achieved through symbolic beats rather than logical progression; abrupt shifts in setting (e.g., twisting corridors) undermine emotional stakes despite strong thematic arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered through precise sensory details (dust smell, shimmering glyphs), though the Egyptian setting occasionally feels like a generic ancient tomb rather than culturally specific.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (static hieroglyphs, unfiltered vision) and resonant themes transcend occasional melodrama; ending elevates concept through earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nuanced imagery (fading photograph as metaphor) balances against occasionally clich√©d phrases ("fretful archer"; "thread in a tapestry"); subverts genre expectations but risks preciousness in philosophical musings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain throughline; the Egyptian setting and subtitles create conceptual fascination while sacrificing narrative logic; lingers as a poetic mood rather than a complete narrative.</comment>
