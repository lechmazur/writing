<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Characters serve as thematic vessels with limited internal depth; motivations stem from symbolic roles rather than psychological complexity, though their silent gestures align with established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on convenient revelations (meteor patterns revealing a map); pacing condenses emotional beats, leaving some developments underexplored within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through vivid sensory details (jasmine, yuzu) and ethereal tone; however, the castle’s reimagined form feels more decorative than integral to thematic or plot progression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stylistic choices (meteor-flower parallels, unspoken gestures) evoke lyrical resonance and thematic cohesion; emotional impact remains restrained but purposeful, with ending underscoring the theme of silent connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Few overt clichés but occasional stylized abstraction risks distancing emotional authenticity (e.g., generic "intimacy" phrasing); metaphors are fresh yet occasionally overwrought, while the core plot avoids predictability.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements are interwoven but unevenly weighted; the pressed flower book and meteor decoder method are indispensable, while the remote herbalist and art class timeframe contribute minimally to narrative cohesion.</comment>
