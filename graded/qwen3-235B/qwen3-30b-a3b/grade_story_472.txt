<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks detailed psychology; motivation tied to plot devices rather than organic internal conflict. Matchmaker's unfulfilled love hinted but not deeply explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherent but compressed; emotional arc truncated by word limit. Resolution feels rushed despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details immerse readers, but "between channels" concept remains underexplained. Setting evokes mood more effectively than it shapes narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "lament as both wound and key" create layered meaning. Ending resonates thematically, though "sharp gentleness" feels inconsistently rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with fresh imagery (e.g., "flag in wind" as activation method), but some phrases like "tapestry of stories" verge on trite. Tone mostly consistent but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements create atmospheric whole but occasional thematic dissonance (e.g., matchmaker's purpose). Lyrical prose carries weight but shortens shelf life of deeper emotional impact.</comment>
