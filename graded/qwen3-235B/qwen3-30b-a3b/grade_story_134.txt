<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Faces contradictions: politeness contrasts with frustration, but emotional evolution remains superficial. Motivation (tracking cultural evolution) is stated but underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is serviceable but formulaic—conflict/resolution follows predictable arc within word limits. Laundry cycles as obstacle feel strained, though crystallization-as-filter provides intriguing pivot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends industrial and mystical elements effectively (fluorescent lights vs. moonlit dew), but sensory details lack specificity. Atmosphere owes more to juxtaposition than immersive description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (tangled roots, crystals as filters) create thematic resonance. Ending lingers, but emotional subtext leans on dialogue rather than subtle characterization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original in combining sorcery with domestic machinery. Avoids clichés but occasionally relies on heavy-handed contrasts without deeper subversion (e.g., polite sorcerer in grimy chamber).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element cohesion is strong, though cultural evolution remains a vague motivation. Tight word limit sacrifices thematic depth, but premise lingers as an intriguing fragment.</comment>
