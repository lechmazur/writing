<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatically opaque; detachment feels imposed rather than earned, and the sudden 'loving resolve' transformation lacks psychological grounding despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot's symbolic arc from discovery to revelation works within constraints, but the logic leap from collage scraps to hidden chamber strains believability, feeling more mystical than method-driven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rust/tech juxtaposition and tactile details (crunching metal, shifting symbols) create a haunting atmosphere; mural's 'chaotic beauty' becomes a tangible narrative force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong unifying theme binds elements cohesively, though the brevity leaves some concepts (secret weavers' philosophy) tantalizingly underexplored rather than deliberately suggestive.</comment>
