<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness/intimacy is subtly shown through actions, motivation to escape AI is clear, but inner conflict lacks depth despite plot alignment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained through the card sequence driving action, but the AI-human intuition conflict resolves too abruptly to fully satisfy within the word limit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis of bardic mystique with AI themes avoids genre tropes; language remains purposeful without unnecessary ornamentation, while the "algorithmic void" twist feels fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the joker's absence as thematic linchpin, though the pre-land creature timeframe feels loosely connected to narrative momentum.</comment>
