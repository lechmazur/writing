<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (rejecting binaries) is stated but thinly dramatized; actions lack visceral connection to inner conflict, voice remains overly abstract with little emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing stalls in middle descriptions; narrative arc exists but relies too heavily on poetic abstraction rather than causally linked events; abrupt transitions undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (neon, rust, zero-g pools) create immersive surrealism; decayed resort atmosphere aligns perfectly with themes of false allure and quiet rebellion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (thread/anvil) carry conceptual weight; ending lacks emotional resonance despite thematic ambition; tone balances subtlety with cosmic strangeness but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original setting twisted with AI-esque flourishes; "poetically bland" phrasing feels algorithmically contrived at times; stray cat motif borders on repetitive symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but narratively diffuse; elements serve theme more than character/story; brevity exposes underdeveloped conflict and abstracted emotional stakes.</comment>
