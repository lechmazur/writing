<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through complex choices; reactions feel more thematic than human; "amiable" trait remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot relies on symbolic transformations rather than causal progression; resolution feels preordained by concept rather than earned; pacing prioritizes lyricism over momentum; circular structure weakens narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile descriptions (salt-stained wood, brine scent) create immersive, oppressive atmosphere; setting functions as active character; however, some decay metaphors border on clich√©.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric layering (crossword as cipher, light/shadow duality) elevates theme; ending achieves symbolic resonance; emotional impact diluted by abstract introspection over visceral character engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in reframing lighthouse function from warning to welcoming; avoids genre tropes through poetic abstraction; occasional phrases ("quiet defiance") risk preciousness but generally maintain stylistic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly in execution; story lingers in mood rather than narrative; brevity serves theme but limits emotional investment; stylistic consistency elevates flawed structural ambition.</comment>
