<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's rebellious trait shapes actions, but lacks emotional depth; motivation exists but feels abstract rather than earned through tangible backstory or nuanced inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pacing feels compressed; the connection between the scratched DVD and rebellion against cynicism requires more narrative breathing room to fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ethereal setting is richly imagined, but sensory details occasionally overreach, relying on poetic abstraction over visceral specificity to anchor the atmosphere in emotional reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and thematic cohesion, but emotional impact is diluted by overly conceptual language; ending resolves effectively but could deepen its resonance with more grounded character reflection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with "twilit affirmations" and neon symbolism, but occasionally slides into ornate phrasing that feels self-conscious rather than organic to the narrative voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and inventive, with elements woven into a thematically rich whole; shorter form works as a vignette but lacks the expansiveness to fully explore secondary threads like the dying streetlamp's backstory.</comment>
