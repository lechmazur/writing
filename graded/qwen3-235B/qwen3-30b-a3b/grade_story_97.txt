<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character shows consistent arc from denial to acceptance of empathy, but remains abstract archetypes; motivations are tied to assigned traits yet lack nuanced emotional realism despite poetic descriptions; inner conflict is conceptually clear but psychologically underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear journey with mythical undertones, but transitions between visions and labyrinth feel rushed; cause/effect between emotional states and dimensional shifts are implied rather than constructed; coherence maintained within constraints, though lacks dynamic progression beyond symbolic inevitability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with vivid surrealism; unstable dimension and bleeding sunsets create visceral disorientation that mirrors emotional states; sensory details enhance thematic resonance though the "whispered minute" timeframe remains more decorative than functionally integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story uses metaphor with precision (compass as emotional guide, garden as resolution) to evoke philosophical questions about rationality vs. empathy; ending provides thematic resolution but leans on archetype-heavy imagery (labyrinth, garden) that diminishes originality; tension lies in internal transformation but lacks external consequences.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose ("heartbreak-induced, jagged and vivid" visions); emotional states are shown through imagery but occasionally veer into clich√© (mosaic of faces); avoids major AI hallmarks but struggles with balancing poetic abstraction against concrete specificity in character psychology and plot logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements are present and thematically interlinked; brevity enhances mythic quality though limits character depth; cohesive in marrying concept to structure, yet sacrifices narrative stakes for symbolic resolution; leaves philosophical residue but lacks emotional urgency that could elevate it to transcendent levels.</comment>
