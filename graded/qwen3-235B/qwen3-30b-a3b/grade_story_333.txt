<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (preserving traditions) are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict; "sincere rebel" label feels surface-level despite plot actions; reactions to sticky note and twist reveal consistency but shallow emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot has a functional arc (infiltration to revelation) but pacing feels slightly rushed; beginning/end connection via "first to fight" twist is clever yet abrupt; cause/effect logic holds despite tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (damp stone, storm-soaked fabric) and symbolic setting shifts; time between storms creates tension; "braided bitterness" tone permeates effectively via environmental decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("past as compass") and layered subtext; ending resonates thematically rather than sentimentally; dialogue balances poeticism with purpose; tension between tradition and truth feels intellectually engaging.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some vivid imagery ("wounded birds") but "cracked porcelain mask" and future-self twist echo genre tropes; emotional resonance relies on concept rather than fully embodied reactions; occasional vague descriptors ("living thing") dilute specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively (sticky note drives both plot and symbolism) but certain forced aspects (constant changing only applies to walls); length feels limiting rather than intentional; theme of fear vs courage lacks groundbreaking exploration.</comment>
