<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through improbable events (dog park, heartbeat timeframe) with inconsistent pacing; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic bookending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though deeper integration between setting and theme is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (umbrella, ocean) and cyclical structure; emotional resonance is undercut by underdeveloped character stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>Narrative coherence maintained despite crowded element list; elements function but feel more like checklist items than organic components.</grade>
