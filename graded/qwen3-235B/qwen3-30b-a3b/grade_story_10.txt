<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character shows superficial transformation but lacks depth in exploring how fatal flaw systematically shaped past actions; emotional arc feels rushed rather than earned through internal coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists within constraints but pivotal transition from discovery to forgiveness lacks sufficient causal development; some forced progression between key beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements nominally integrated but several feel decorative rather than essential; brevity serves as constraint rather than artistic choice; thematic resonance remains underdeveloped.</comment>
