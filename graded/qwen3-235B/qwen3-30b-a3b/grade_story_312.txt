<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's agoraphobia underdeveloped; motivation to confront inheritance is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of how fear shapes her actions. Ending transformation feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but overly compressed; pivotal emotional shifts occur without sufficient buildup, leaving key narrative beats feeling rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Absorbing atmosphere with vivid sensory details (petrichor, shifting dunes) that deepen themes, though the worldbuilding occasionally veers into overly ornate descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses strong symbolism (rain as destiny, orb as stolen legacy) but relies on overt exposition ("some burdens are meant to be carried") rather than fully immersive subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes through metaphorical dunes-as-mirror and rain-coded lullaby, but contains traces of overwrought phrasing like "whispers of her fatherâ€™s failures" that feel formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strikes a compelling balance between lyrical prose and thematic ambition, but constrained by uneven pacing and underexplored character complexity.</comment>
