<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character relies on surface traits; motivation to "taunt the system" lacks psychological depth. Ghost interactions hint at internal conflict but remain underexplored. Dialogue lacks distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure functional but predictable. The twist with ghosts feels telegraphed. Pacing uneven—confrontation rushes while exposition lingers. Cause/effect between ledger/tape dispensers and climax remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid details but setting feels generic. Diesel/decay sensory elements succeed, but the dystopian farm doesn't differentiate itself from trope-heavy precursors. Connection between empty tape dispensers and worldbuilding is underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses strong metaphors ("jaws of defeat") but emotional impact remains superficial. Ending attempts thematic resonance but falls into cliché ("grin through the cracks"). Shows more than tells, though subtext lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overtly formulaic phrasing but leans on dystopian tropes. Ghost interrogation concept is original yet execution feels mechanical. Emotional nuance present in ghost dialogues but broader tone lacks unique stylistic fingerprint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but don't elevate. Story feels like polished genre piece rather than boundary-pushing literature. Weak thematic throughline despite individual strengths. Memorable concepts undercut by shallow execution.</comment>
