<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's bashfulness inconsistently informs actions; motivation to preserve dance movements exists but lacks emotional depth; keychain's significance as an object shaping decisions feels underdeveloped despite surface-level symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from tension (snapped anchor) to resolution but relies on arbitrary metaphysical properties of the keychain/tides. Cause-effect logic collapses at climax; pacing drags in middle section despite tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative language (salt/incense) creates atmosphere but fails to connect tides and yoga studio meaningfully to core themes. Sensory details overwhelm rather than deepen character's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (keychain as metronome) and poetic imagery but relies too heavily on telling emotions ("quiet ferocity") rather than authentic emotional progression. Ending lacks thematic payoff despite lyrical surface.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but defaults to "transcending fear through ritual" arcs. Some overwrought phrases ("keychain's fragile song") undermine emotional nuance. Integration of water imagery avoids being purely decorative but leans on convenience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements serve checklist rather than organic cohesion. Studio setting and tides create visual appeal but don't organically drive the preservation ritual's emotional stakes. Style maintains clarity but lacks distinctive authorial voice.</comment>
