<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete motivations despite poetic descriptions. Actions are symbolic but underdeveloped, with no tangible progression or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot consists of static introspection with no arc or conflict. Pacing meanders; cause-effect unclear. Coherence exists but lacks momentum or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is sensory and immersive, but setting feels decorative rather than integral. Connection between "leaf office" and thematic elements remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor/symbolism, particularly the mask-as-bridge. Theme of nonviolence and self-searching is present, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Verdant prose occasionally veers into purple terrain. Metaphors like "braided bitterness" feel strained. Tonal consistency achieved, but relies on familiar existential motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels mechanical. Assigned elements are present but unevenly integratedâ€”some feel like checklist items rather than organic components.</comment>
