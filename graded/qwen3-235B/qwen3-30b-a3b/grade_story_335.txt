<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Certain traits (shakiness, recklessness) surface but remain underexplored; motivations are clear but psychological complexity feels thin despite introspective moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression toward relic’s discovery works, but the thematic resolution feels abrupt; emotional payoff lacks sufficient build-up within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid juxtaposition of decay and artistry in the cathedral creates a memorable atmosphere; sensory details effectively mirror internal states but occasionally over-ornamented.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., frozen spider as static time) carry thematic weight; ending resolves too neatly for such a restrained narrative, diluting subtler emotional textures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrases like “slow fade of an echoing hour” border on cliché; some imagery leans into AI-generated cadence, though atmospheric cohesion avoids outright formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent parable but rely too heavily on familiar tropes (redemption through relic); brevity works but sacrifices depth.</comment>
