<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; Rourke's stoicism occasionally falters, but motivations lack depth, making the emotional arc feel unearned despite moments of vulnerability. Dialogue attempts distinctiveness but leans on clichéd gravitas.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Predictable three-act structure within constraints; momentum stumbles slightly during abrupt transitions between bar and sanctuary. Cause-effect logic holds, but pacing feels padded in middle segments, diluting tension from the wallet’s discovery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative but inconsistent sensory worldbuilding: honey and gravel are visceral, while "pompous humility" tone strains credulity. Sanctuary feels richly imagined, but the corner bar’s atmosphere isn’t integrated beyond being a narrative trigger point.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (wallet as "relic," heart as "fortress") are functional but occasionally overwritten. Subtext about emotional navigation emerges, yet themes are often told rather than shown, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lyrical passages undercut by formulaic descriptors ("amber eyes," "smoky air"). Attempts subversion through tonal contrasts (irony/sincerity) but relies on trite emotional beats ("ache of something unnamed"). Avoids overt tropes but lacks linguistic originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but strain under scrutiny—wallet’s contents feel constructed rather than organic. Atmosphere elevates material, yet thematic integration of "untamed sincerity" falters. Lingers intellectually but lands unevenly emotionally.</comment>
