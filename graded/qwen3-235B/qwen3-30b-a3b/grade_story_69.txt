<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's uncertainty and obligation are present but motivations lack visceral depth; their voice remains abstract rather than distinct, with emotional shifts feeling somewhat generalized despite intriguing symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but pacing feels uneven—library references and hologram shop interlude create friction in momentum; the connection between wandering and performance resolves only partially, leaving some episodic fragmentation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich atmosphere through precise details like "flickering projections" and "brittle script pages" creates immersive tension between decay and artistry; the "lethargic excitement" tone is evocatively sustained through environmental metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elegant imagery ("tin's dents as a map") elevates the narrative thematically, but emotional impact remains diffuse—subtext about obligation vs. purpose is clear yet underdeveloped; symbolism occasionally overrides character psychology.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by blending fantasy and sci-fi elements but lapses into ornate phrasing ("half-finished dreams" recurs as vague motif); character reasoning feels more mythic-archetypal than humanly nuanced, possibly intentionally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elegant prose and conceptual unity exist, but cohesive force is uneven—some assigned elements (library hours, theater method) feel dutifully included rather than organically integrated into the druid's journey.</comment>
