<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Purpose stated, not demonstrated; motivation lacks nuance despite clear throughline of "daring compassion". Ethereal form mentioned frequently but doesn't deeply shape personality or decisions. Teddy bear's significance remains external to character's inner life.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Progression from vault to aurora spiral follows logical arc, but time jumps and data cascade lack narrative preparation. Sacrifice ending satisfies thematically but feels rushed within constraints. Cosmic disclaimers lack concrete execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Radiant sensory overload creates immersive VR atmosphere. Data streams as "liquid starlight" and flickering holograms evoke elegant chaos. Setting's fractal instability meaningfully connects to plot stakes. Load cycles function more as poetic metaphor than functional timeframe.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes impress, but emotional resonance remains distant. Metaphors ("ghostly pendulum," "symphony of light") elevate craft, yet the core theme of sacrifice lacks visceral impact. Subtext about digital ephemerality hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with precise imagery, but cosmic disclaimer concept feels like unearned space opera trope. Occasional overadjectival passages ("alien frequency that defied the archiveâ€™s logic") border on purple prose. Teddy bear paradox shows ingenuity, though "daring compassion" remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unifying concept maintains coherence despite fantastical elements. Virtual reality framework allows plausible strangeness. Some overreliance on poetic abstraction over narrative precision undermines immediacy. Concision admirable but occasionally at cost of thematic depth.</comment>
