<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's introspective motivation is conceptually clear but underexplored through actions; "wisely foolish" tag lacks tangible manifestations in behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Musical notes provide a linear plot structure, but the climactic revelation feels rushed and abstract rather than earned through concrete narrative beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Haunting sensory details (prismatic light, pulsing notes) create strong atmosphere, but winter's bite metaphor feels overfamiliar rather than inventive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (cracked lens, mosaic metaphor) and poetic cadences elevate thematic depth, though emotional impact is diluted by abstract resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original integration of absurd elements (living music, talking shadows) avoids clich√©s, but some phrases ("whispers of winter") veer into ornate generality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; brevity works for mythic tone but sacrifices deeper character/worldbuilding engagement.</comment>
