<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character traits of prudence and cheerfulness are stated but not consistently demonstrated through actions; motivation is present but underexplored, weakening coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear sequence but feels rushed, with underdeveloped transitions; the map/reveal arc is functional but lacks emotional or logical depth within the constrained word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic descriptors ("dust and forgotten prayers") rather than specific sensory details; the Minoan palace reimagining lacks cultural or historical anchoring to deepen its significance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Attempts layered themes (ancestry, legacy) but leans on clichéd metaphors ("spiral of ancestry," "promise of the unknown"); emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Relies on predictable tropes (lost civilizations, cryptic maps) with minimal subversion; prose occasionally veers into purple prose ("whispers through stone," "dance of ancient figures"), diluting originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elements feel compartmentalized; the knight’s cheerfulness, evening commute, and Minoan setting aren’t tightly interwoven; thematic cohesion is superficial rather than deeply earned.</comment>
