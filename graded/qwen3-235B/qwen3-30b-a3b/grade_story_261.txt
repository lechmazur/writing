<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's immortality and obsession are established, but motivations lack psychological depth; actions align with guilt-driven persistence but inner conflicts remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains atmosphere but lacks clear progression; repetitive cycles of failure undermine narrative momentum, and the conclusion feels truncated within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is immersive with vivid sensory details; the particle acceleration garden's fusion of decay and technology enhances tone, though some worldbuilding elements strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ink as language of decay; earbud as chain), but emotional impact is diluted by passive narration and underdeveloped conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with original concepts but veers into abstract excess; metaphors are strong but occasional overreliance on poetic phrasing obscures narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a cohesive whole, with strong atmospheric unity; ambition exceeds technical execution, but the theme of cyclical failure/resilience leaves lingering resonance.</comment>
