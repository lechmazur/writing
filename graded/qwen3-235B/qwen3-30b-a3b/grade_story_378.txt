<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mayor's grumpiness is surface-level, not deeply tied to motivation; his shift from avoidance to commitment lacks visceral emotional beats despite thematic alignment with "fate."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc but relies on convenient exposition (overheard conversation) and compressed revelations; pacing feels slightly rushed in the swamp-approach section.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (burnt beans, swamp stench, beetle's organic core) immerse effectively, though the monks' role remains underexplored beyond symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (beetle as failed stewardship, swamp as dying entity) and subtext about human-nature reconciliation elevate impact; resolution avoids saccharine triumphalism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding avoids total clich√© (e.g., reclusive monks with mechanical eco-tech), but phrases like "water wisdom" and "ancient song" flirt with vagueness; emotional beats occasionally over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, but the carnival framing device and monk subplot feel underutilized despite contributing to atmosphere and stakes.</comment>
