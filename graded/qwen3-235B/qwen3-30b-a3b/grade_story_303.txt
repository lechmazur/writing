<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's peculiar nature and mapping motivation are stated but underdemonstrated in action; emotional arc resolves through conceptual revelation rather than organic growth, risking abstraction over authenticity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Circular structure connects beginning/end effectively but compresses pivotal transformation too abruptly; mystical exposition risks losing narrative momentum in the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (glowing grains, cardamom scent) create vivid, thematically resonant atmosphere that deepens through story's progression; each element amplifies existential disorientation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original metaphysical framework avoids genre clich√©s, but abstract language sometimes verges on over-elaboration; emotional logic risks feeling algorithmically constructed rather than viscerally human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narrative's elegant conceptual symmetry is undercut by occasional narrative compression challenges; leaves resonant metaphysical question about perception.</comment>
