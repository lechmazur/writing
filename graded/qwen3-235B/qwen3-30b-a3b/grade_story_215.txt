<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's "rattled exorcist" and "inwardly social" traits are inconsistently demonstrated; motivation to "entwine science with wonder" drives plot but lacks emotional depth; reactions to puzzles and postcard lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows puzzle-solving logic, but pacing falters under word constraint—staircase reveal and hidden chamber feel rushed; cause-effect clarity maintained, but resolution lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Psychic research facility and bioluminescent fungi create eerie atmosphere, but dance lessons and observatory setting underutilized; sensory details are often generic rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of science vs. wonder hint at depth but rely on clichés; incantation recitation and hologram dissolve lack emotional resonance; ending feels narratively convenient.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Relies on genre tropes (hidden rooms, forbidden libraries) with minimal subversion; overuse of "rattled" and "inwardly social" feel formulaic; dialogue is purposeful but lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements are present but unevenly integrated; dance lessons and coy aggression feel forced; thematic unity is compromised by episodic structure.</comment>
