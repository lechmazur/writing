<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's absent-mindedness is established but inconsistently shown through actions. Motivation to "salvage a vision" remains abstract; inner conflict feels underdeveloped despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot structure is circular but lacks narrative tension. Scenes transition without clear cause-effect relationships; the resolution emerges abruptly without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (brass knocker, glass floors) create immersion, but the archive's sterile AI tone contradicts the brewer's introspective melancholy in ways that aren't fully exploited thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("river without a shore," "storm of doubt") elevate impact. Ending's emotional resonance is diluted by overly neat thematic resolution between humanity/machines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrases ("storm of doubt," "aching for connection") verge on trope-repetition. The brewer's emotional arc feels genuine but is occasionally buried beneath dense descriptive flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under word limit constraints. The archive setting and yeast vial combine effectively, though the redemptive arc feels truncated.</comment>
