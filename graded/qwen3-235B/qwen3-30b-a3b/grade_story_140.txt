<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but occasionally feels overly tied to assigned traits, with emotional nuances emerging primarily through symbolic elements rather than organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemptive arc but feels compressed; transitions between memory and present lack fluidity, and the resolution hinges on a pivotal element (planetarium show) that feels underintegrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is evocatively rendered with sensory details, though the timeframe's role in shaping atmosphere remains underexploited despite strong anchoring in the circus dressing room's decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor and symbolism are effective, but subtext is occasionally overshadowed by overt thematic statements; ending resonates but risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original in its synthesis of elements but occasionally slips into familiar motifs (haunted artifacts, redemption arcs); prose balances clarity and lyricism without fully transcending formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story succeeds as a mood piece but cohesion is strained by underdeveloped connections between key elements, particularly the planetarium show's narrative weight.</comment>
