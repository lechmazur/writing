<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character's occupation as a dog walker is underutilized; motivation to "stand where fear dares not tread" is clear but lacks emotional or psychological depth, rendering Elias more as an atmospheric device than a fully fleshed person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Narrative arc from entering the dining room to justified presence via blood-drinking is conceptually coherent but executes unevenly—cause-and-effect relationships feel abrupt in key moments, undermining the tight word limit's potential for precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are immersive, with vivid, paradoxical sensory details (jasmine/decay, pulsing plants, metallic blood) that directly enhance both mood and thematic tension between control and curiosity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses potent metaphors (e.g., "color bled from day into night") and subtext about complicity, but occasionally leans on poetic vagueness over emotional specificity; ending resonates but lacks narrative punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elevates trope of the forbidden chamber with the blood drive twist and botanical decay; avoids clichés but skirts purple prose in atmospheric passages, and some emotional nuance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements like the botanical collection, blood drive, and mansion are strong, but others (silent agreements, "carefully careless") feel loosely integrated; thematic cohesion is partially achieved but uneven in execution.</comment>
