<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characters remain abstract metaphors; motivation is stated not demonstrated. Defined by poetic conceits rather than psychology, with actions serving thematic goals but lacking behavioral logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmented chronology mimics time loops but creates disjointed momentum. Closure is thematic rather than narrative, sacrificing emotional payoff for conceptual cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans too heavily on atmospheric clich√©s ("fragmented light," "unrelenting") without grounding. Sensory details are poetic but ephemeral, failing to build tangible worlds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical density compensates for minimal plot. The pool-as-mirror motif and amber symbolism create resonant subtext. Ending achieves thematic catharsis despite skeletal narrative structure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but generally maintains vivid specificity. Subverts femme fatale conventions through existential introspection rather than archetypal behavior, though time travel mechanics remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elegant thematic architecture compensates for narrative brevity but cannot fully transcend it. Elements merge conceptually rather than dramatically; more philosophical poem than structured narrative fiction.</comment>
