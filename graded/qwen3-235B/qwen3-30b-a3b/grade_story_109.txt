<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character traits like "cold-natured" and "lawfully rebellious" are stated but underexplored; internal conflict feels abstract rather than earned through concrete actions or nuanced psychology. The knight's sudden emotional thaw lacks gradual buildup to fully convince.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (mechanical mission to emotional awakening) but relies on abrupt transitions (e.g., secret agent center to altars). The folk remedies and mitten drive the action, but cause-effect logic is occasionally obscured by lyrical abstraction. Pacing is uneven in spots.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (neon alleys, crumbling altars) with strong sensory details (lavender/pine scent, frost), but the secret agent center feels incongruous with the mythic altars. The "lawfully rebellious" trait and setting clash tonally, weakening coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (mitten as bridge between duty and warmth, frost-to-canvas metaphor) elevates the theme. The ending resonates emotionally, but subtext remains surface-level; the central conflict (duty vs. humanity) is familiar rather than deeply innovative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Some poetic overwriting ("whispering mitten," "heart as fortress") veers toward clich√©. Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic (e.g., "quiet rebellion" as a trope). The knight's motivation occasionally feels logically imposed rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Despite cohesive themes, the story leans heavily on lyrical abstraction to mask underdeveloped elements (e.g., secret agent center's role, altars' lore). The brevity works for introspection but leaves character and setting gaps. Memorable imagery outweighs structural flaws.</comment>
