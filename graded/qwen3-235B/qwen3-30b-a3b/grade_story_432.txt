<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Occasional overly poetic phrasing verges on purple prose; hidden societies/talk-radio psychic elements contain familiar tropes but are subverted through surreal juxtaposition; emotional beats are shown rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>All elements cohere around central metaphor; story maintains stylistic consistency despite ambitious conceptual load; brevity serves thematic compression rather than feels restrictive.</comment>
