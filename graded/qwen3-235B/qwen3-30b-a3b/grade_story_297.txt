<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations (finding lost city, rebelling against tradition) are present but underexplored; Mira’s actions and dialogue lack sufficient nuance to fully embody her rebelliousness and personal quest, feeling occasionally schematic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot moves cohesively between customer interaction and introspective resolution, but the abrupt 500-word arc feels compressed; emotional beats and implications of Mira’s decision to leave are underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lava flow setting and “forgotten songs” tone are vividly rendered with sensory details (smell of espresso, obsidian-like ink), though the post-laughter atmosphere lacks deeper integration into character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of rebellion-as-ink and fusion of myth/personal history is evocative, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on poetic abstraction; ending suggests theme but avoids concrete resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrases (“pulse of ink,” “relentless flow”) risk poetic redundancy; avoids clichés in setting/concept but occasionally substitutes atmospheric vagueness for emotional specificity, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements (satchel, lost city) integrate well with theme but occasionally feel checklist-bound rather than organically intertwined; the story’s brevity works thematically but limits narrative depth.</comment>
