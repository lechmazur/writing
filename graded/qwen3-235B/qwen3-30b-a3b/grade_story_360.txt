<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Main character’s meekness is consistent but underexplored; motivation to decode the riddle feels abstract rather than deeply personal. Final resolution lacks emotional weight due to passive development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear throughline from broken pen to revelation, but the sudden shift to using dew drop feels undermotivated. Pacing is deliberate but occasionally static; plot hinges on metaphysical epiphany over actionable stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rich sensory contrasts (goblin grime vs. dew starlight) enhance mood. Underground city and playground sounds juxtapose innocence and decay, but the goblins’ symbolic role feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry, ink as memory) are evocative, with a theme of interconnectedness that resonates. The ending’s transcendence is poignant, though some abstract passages lean into poetic vagueness over concrete realization.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by focusing on introspection over conflict. Lyrical prose occasionally skirts purple prose, but fresh imagery (dew drop as “trembling star”) and psychological subtext elevate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not indispensable; playground sounds and goblins feel secondary to theme. Brevity serves the mystical tone but leaves some threads underdeveloped.</comment>
