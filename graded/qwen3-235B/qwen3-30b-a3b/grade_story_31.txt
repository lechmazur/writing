<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Characters are archetypal but undergo subtle transformation; motivations align with actions, though internal conflicts remain underexplored, and dialogue occasionally lacks nuance despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and purposeful, with clear cause-and-effect, but pacing stumbles in the orchardist’s sudden realization of connection, feeling rushed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is vivid and immersive, blending cyberpunk grit with organic fragility. Sensory details enhance atmosphere, though the “hush between heartbeats” timeframe feels ambiguously integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Storytelling excels in symbolism (key, garden) and emotional impact. Dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism, but the ending resonates thematically. Subtext about belonging is layered and evocative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity in setting and metaphor; the cyberpunk-rooftop juxtaposition is original. However, character dynamics and the child’s role border on trope, though subtly subverted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically, though some (timeframe, child’s persistence) feel less essential. Style is polished but occasionally ornate, and brevity serves the narrative but limits depth.</comment>
