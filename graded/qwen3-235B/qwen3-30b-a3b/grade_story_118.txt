<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lack of distinct character traits, inconsistent motivation, no voice or dialogue to establish personality. Action-reasoning disconnect in using wax to anchor the ephemeral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No clear plot arc within constraints, static progression despite atmospheric buildup. Action (draining wax) stagnates rather than driving momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (smell, flickering lights) create immersive mood. Peculiar uniformity established but disconnected from agents' presence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Metaphors present but abstract; ending feels unresolved. Theme of memory/reality tension implied but underdeveloped. Lacks emotional resonance beyond mood.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Originality in combining hive-mind/espionage/wax ritual but formulaic phrasing ("thrum of charger," "whispers demanding sacrifice"). Overly ornate descriptions without narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Cohesive atmosphere but disjointed integration of elements (agents mentioned but irrelevant). Style prioritizes poetic abstraction over clarity or narrative purpose.</comment>
