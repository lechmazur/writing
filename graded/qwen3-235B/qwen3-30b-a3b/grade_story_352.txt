<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve music is clear but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but inner conflict remains underexplored beyond stated discontent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot lacks a traditional arc; atmospheric progression replaces clear cause-and-effect; completeness is achieved through lyrical repetition rather than narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (static, parchment, humming machines) create a haunting atmosphere that perfectly complements the theme of fading traditions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (music surviving the void) and symbolic imagery resonate; ending feels thematically satisfying but emotional impact is diffused by abstract tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors, but occasional overly ornate phrasing (e.g., "paradox of joy and sorrow") and formulaic repetitions like "vanishing stars" suggest slight mechanical tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a cohesive whole but occasionally feel like curated symbols rather than organically integrated; brevity enhances mystery but limits tension.</comment>
