<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is surface-level; trauma-driven motivation is evident but underdeveloped. Transformation feels abrupt, though thematic duality between guardian/prisoner is conceptually strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently but relies on abrupt revelations (inscribed name) rather than earned progression. The sand mandala's ritualistic resolution ties together themes but feels slightly condensed for the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisite—witch's room brims with tactile details (ozone, starlight, shifting sand) that immerse readers. Setting isn't just backdrop but an active force shaping character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Uses potent symbolism (tube as fractured self, grain as atonement) and lyrical metaphors. Emotional depth emerges through subtext, though some concepts (multiply singular) aren't fully translated into visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Echoes of "magical object" tropes exist, but the cardboard tube and trauma-as-redemption angle subvert expectations. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction that dilutes human nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive despite ambitious elements, though the brevity occasionally strains complexity. Leverages constraints intentionally—every image (single grain of sand) resonates symbolically.</comment>
