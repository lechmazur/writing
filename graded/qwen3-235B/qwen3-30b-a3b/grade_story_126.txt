<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth despite intriguing premise; motivations remain cryptic, reducing emotional engagement. Actions feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints, but pacing relies too heavily on dreamlike transitions rather than organic cause-effect. Resolution feels abrupt yet conceptually cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive (decaying space station, bioluminescent decay) with vivid sensory details, though some descriptions verge on excessive without clear functional purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (churn-as-key, void-as-canvas) and thematic subtext about truth-seeking. Occasional "telling" of emotions weakens otherwise effective showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi with ecological themes; avoids overt clich√©s. Some phrases (e.g., "silent scream," "canvas" metaphor) border on overused, but unique combinations (butter churn as relic) elevate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively with thematic intent. Brief length feels purposeful, leaving lingering philosophical weight about rebellion and illusion.</comment>
