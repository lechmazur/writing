<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s stubbornness is consistent but underdeveloped; motivations tied to guilt and identity are revealed late, weakening emotional resonance. Lacks distinct voice despite introspective narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing is uneven; the gondola journey and introspective revelations clash slightly. The shift from vengeance to self-confrontation is abrupt but thematically cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid mountain imagery and mystical atmosphere enhance the tone, but sensory details are uneven—some moments feel abstract rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical depth (flute as guilt/reflection) and thematic resolution elevate the story. Ending feels earned, though emotional impact is diluted by sparse character interaction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on “dark reflection” trope without full subversion. Language occasionally veers into poetic abstraction but mostly maintains clarity and purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are woven cohesively, with a thematically resonant payoff. Some assigned components (e.g., "visually unappealing") feel superficial. Ending lingers but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
