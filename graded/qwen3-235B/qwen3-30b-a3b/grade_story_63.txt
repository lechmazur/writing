<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's 'reserved' nature is consistently shown through physical actions rather than dialogue, and 'humbly proud' motivation drives meticulous restoration work. However, internal conflict beyond dedication remains underexplored despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot unfolds through cyclical mending acts creating subtle ripple effects, with choir practice providing temporal anchors. Pacing balances lyrical prose and narrative momentum, though the ending leans on thematic repetition rather than concrete resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Damp, echo-filled lab permeated by fading melodies creates vivid sensory immersion. The wallpaper's physicality and scrawls' whispering enhance atmosphere of fragile preservation. Choir laughter as auditory contrast achieves poignant tonal layering.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric linkage between embroidered cuffs and scrawls offers strong visual-symbolic throughline. Subtle emotional impact emerges through motifs of tactile restoration rather than direct statement. Ending connects personal sacrifice to universal themes of cultural preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original 'lab of lost sounds' concept avoids clich√© through tactile descriptions. Some repetitive phrasal cadences ('ripple effect' sections) approach formulaic patterns. Emotional nuance emerges through environmental interaction over psychological exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements function organically within metaphorical framework. Poetic compression sustains thematic elegance without feeling artificially constrained. Lingering resonance stems from juxtaposing impermanence (fractured notes) against persistence (embroidered records).</comment>
