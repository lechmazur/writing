<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and arrogance permeate actions and dialogue, but motivation to "harness the ephemeral" lacks deep psychological grounding; transformation from isolation to connection feels abrupt despite atmospheric cues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses coherently within constraints, linking globe interaction to hidden chamber discovery, but the canyon's voice and scholar's fate feel slightly under-explained, disrupting cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse library's decayed grandeur and the canyon's haunted atmosphere create immersive, tactile eeriness; however, "borrowed century" timeframe remains abstract, diluting temporal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphor of the globe as a mirror of loneliness is potent, and the ending elevates themes of connection, but some lyrical passages verge on self-indulgent prose without deepening narrative impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with the scholar’s haunting-as-metaphor and subversion of "isolation"; descriptions feel vivid rather than formulaic, though minor overreliance on adjectives slightly dampens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements integrate with thematic purpose, but the time-bound "borrowed century" and canyon’s voice feel unevenly weighted; the ending’s resolution lingers effectively without overstaying its brevity.</comment>
