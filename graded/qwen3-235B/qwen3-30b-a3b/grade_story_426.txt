<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Main traits (determination, aloofness) guide actions, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Hug scene reveals vulnerability but lacks earned emotional weight. Dialogue minimal, voice leans on poetic abstraction over concrete characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear three-act skeleton exists (entry → confrontation → discovery) but pacing stumbles during map/greenhouse transition. Ghost train framing provides circular structure, yet some cause-effect links (e.g., teapot crack releasing light) feel magical-deus ex machina rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Auditory details (melody, ghost train sounds) and tactile contrasts (warmth of teapot vs cold scarf) create immersive decay. Setting’s nostalgic rot mirrors protagonist’s obsession with preserving what’s lost, making atmosphere thematically functional. Minor overuse of "broken glass" cliché.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor of fractured heirloom holding "future" is elegant. Ending’s "quiet storm" mixes tension with closure. Underdeveloped conflict—ghost interaction lacks stakes since resistance never materializes. Theme of remembrance-as-healing emerges consistently but predictably.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Marathon training" feels arbitrarily tagged onto "listening" metaphor rather than organic. Occasional phrases ("storm of purpose") verge on purple. Fresh twist on ghost-bargaining trope exists, but "coded songs holding remedies" concept leans on magical MacGuffin storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements generally serve plot but require suspension of disbelief (hacking playlists → herbal recipes?; marathon training’s relevance). Setting and core tone work synergistically; some mechanical cogs (method, timeframe) exposed under scrutiny. Lingering impression stems from lyrical atmosphere rather than narrative innovation.</comment>
