<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Solemn, symbolic character but lacks concrete inner conflicts; motivations (heartbreak, seeking meaning) are clear but abstract development diminishes psychological believability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Meandering poetic structure undermines narrative drive; key moments (dictionary compilation, city awakening) lack causal urgency despite evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vibrant aquatic metaphors enhance mood, but setting functions more as aesthetic than interactive environment with limited cultural/physical rules.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphor-dense prose creates haunting tone, but thematic resolution feels preordained rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by clich√©d beats ("vanished lover," "forge as heart"); lyrical phrasing often transcends formulaic character arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic synthesis compromised by structural looseness; metaphor overload weakens emotional stakes despite resonant imagery.</comment>
