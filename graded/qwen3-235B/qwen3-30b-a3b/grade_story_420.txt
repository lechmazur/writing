<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear (transformation of failure) but lacks psychological depth; internal conflict is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. The "theoretically free" attribute remains unexplored, weakening character coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is conceptually tight but suffers from abrupt logical jumps—method and resolution feel convenient rather than organically earned. Light's boundaries theme resurfaces too suddenly in conclusion, undercutting earlier foreshadowing. Pacing uneven but mostly functional within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly evoked through fossil bones and flickering bulbs, but tonal dissonance exists between "excited boredom" and the story's poetic gravity. Sensory details about bark/obsidian are strong, though light concept remains under-embodied in the physical world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (fossils/shadow as time, ring as paradox of permanence) elevates narrative. Ending resonates thematically though slightly over-explained. Confident command of lyrical prose and metaphor, though emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic arc through specific imagery choices (e.g., obsidian ring), but suffers from poetic clichés ("edge of infinite"). Metaphors mostly fresh, though boundary-of-light concept borders on abstraction-as-substance. Emotion sometimes filtered through conceptualization rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively despite ambitious concept density. Style enhances rather than hinders, though brevity sacrifices character depth. Conclusion feels earned yet risks over-resolving—leaves thematic questions but lacks visceral lingering impact expected at literary apex.</comment>
