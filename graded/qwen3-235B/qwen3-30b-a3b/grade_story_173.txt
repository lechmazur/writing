<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but emotional depth remains surface-level; "trustworthy unique" is implied through action but not fully fleshed-out.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically via phantom hand's intervention, but the pivotal transformation scene feels rushed; ending resonates thematically despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Underwater city hall's sensory details immerse readers, though multiverse integration feels abstract rather than visceral; atmosphere elevates the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., multiverse as orchard) are striking; emotional resonance lingers through cyclical structure, though subtext could deepen the "reclamation" theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with fresh imagery (phantom hand's touch as method), but occasionally leans on ornate descriptions that border on self-indulgent; emotional nuance balances mechanical elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven with thematic core; brevity enhances poetic resonance, though multiverse implications warrant broader exploration beyond the story's scope.</comment>
