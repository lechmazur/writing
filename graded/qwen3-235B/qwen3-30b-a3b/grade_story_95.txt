<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but lack depth; Elian remains a symbolic figure rather than a nuanced individual. Actions align with traits, but psychological complexity is minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; key moments (button press) lack build-up. The narrative arc is implied rather than earned, with underdeveloped cause-effect chains.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively blends storm imagery with internal states, though the storm-chasing/monastery fusion occasionally feels dissonant. Sensory details are vivid but selective.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (buttons, storms) elevates the story. The ending resonates thematically, but emotional engagement is uneven. Subtext about memory is compelling yet understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction ("timidly loud"). Metaphors are inventive; some descriptors border on ornate. Tension between human and algorithmic voice remains ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Idea is cohesive and thematically rich, though constrained by brevity. Elements serve the story but could interweave more seamlessly. Ends with lingering resonance but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
