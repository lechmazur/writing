<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character development is present but surface-level; motivation to become a guardian is clear but lacks depth in showing internal conflict or nuanced transformation beyond stated redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed; abrupt shifts between the doctor’s waiting room and the village disrupt logical flow, while the detour setup feels underutilized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, but the connection between the sterile waiting room and the mystical village feels forced rather than enhancing cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (sheet music as map, flame as hope) elevates the theme, but emotional resonance is diluted by overly summarized introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar redemption arcs; while poetic, phrases like "green-lit sanctuary" occasionally veer into ornate abstraction without deepening subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, though the waiting room flashback and construction detour feel tacked on; the story lingers thematically but sacrifices narrative urgency for lyrical reflection.</comment>
