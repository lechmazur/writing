<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation and underdeveloped voice; the sentinel’s dry wit feels superficial rather than shaping their decisions or interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pacing falters in tight word limit; abrupt shifts in logic (e.g., ghostly reflection, rope’s agency) undermine cause-effect coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere sustained via vivid sensory details (salt, lavender, mirror movements), but setting’s haunting doesn’t fully integrate with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (rope as promise) and haunting imagery elevate the story, but ending lacks decisive thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Over-reliance on familiar gothic tropes (ghostly reflections, lighthouses) and flowery abstractions; emotional subtext feels forced rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elements strain under thematic ambition; some threads (dance, eroded promises) resonate, but cohesion falters under formulaic phrasing.</comment>
