<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but flirts with poetic abstraction; some phrases feel rehearsed, though cosmic-weaving conceit is inventive and emotionally textured.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose supports cohesion but sacrifices character depth; brief form enhances mystery at the cost of narrative weight.</comment>
