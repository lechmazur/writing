<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Characters are archetypal with surface-level depth. Lira's motives align with actions, but lack psychological complexity. The boy's transformation is underdeveloped. Dialogue feels more thematic than authentically human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Non-linear progression leans on poetic transitions rather than narrative momentum. Plot structure exists but relies heavily on thematic repetition. Pacing uneven - some sections dragged while crucial moments felt rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest element. Sensory details (steam curling like questions, tasting memories) create vivid immersion. The floating cloud cafe as a liminal space during blackout is brilliantly realized. Tonal contrasts enhance thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through subtext rather than explicit declaration. Metaphors are well-woven (vest as inherited responsibility, blackout as revelation). Ending achieves satisfying circularity while maintaining thematic consistency. Conceptual theme of listening through silence lingers beyond text.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept with fresh metaphors (blackout as revealer rather than destroyer, scream of silence), but bordering on excessive poetic abstraction. Some phrases risk purple prose territory. Sensory details are specific but occasionally overwrought. Emotional subtext shows more than tells, with exceptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not always narratively. The brief length works for mood but constrains character development. Writing demonstrates creative metaphoric thinking but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative clarity. Leaves interpretive space without feeling incomplete.</comment>
