<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's "gracefully awkward" trait is superficially stated but underexplored; motivation to learn healing traditions lacks depth in tying to lumberjack identity. Actions rely on generic resolve rather than nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on rushed supernatural revelations; cause-effect clear (nightmares decode letter), but transitions between revamp, hidden war, and healing arc feel contrived. Ending resolution is abrupt despite thematic mirroring of ossuary's transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with visceral contrasts (rosemary/decay, skeletal remains/wild thyme) and oppressive mist. Setting deeply enriches tone, but ossuary's dual purpose as tomb and restaurant contains underutilized lore.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emotional impact lies in subversive theme ("healing as choice") and bone-to-spice imagery. Clich√©d "nightmare visions" undercut originality; ending evokes reflection but leans on sentimental closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality diluted by gothic tropes (haunted ossuaries, coded war letters). Some fresh concepts (healing recipes as weaponized commerce) but undercut by purple prose ("harsh tenderness") and predictable warlord-vault imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements fit superficially but lack symbiosis; the coded letter and revamp drive cohesion, while "gracefully awkward" and "harsh tenderness" feel imposed. Brevity serves atmosphere but weakens thematic payoff.</comment>
