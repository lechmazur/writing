<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are thematic but lack psychological depth; actions are driven by abstract ideals rather than human complexity or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot advances through symbolic gestures and imagery rather than organic causality; resolution feels abrupt despite a clear arc, with pacing hindered by compressed exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and haunting, with sensory details (ice-laden wind, brittle silk) vividly reinforcing the eerie, desolate tone; setting and mood are inseparable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and symbolism (veil as fractured beauty, snowflakes as order/decay) elevates the narrative, though emotional resonance is diluted by abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through inventive juxtaposition (lighthouse orchard, idol of fear), but occasionally veers into opaque, over-embellished prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually, but story occasionally feels like a scaffold for its motifs rather than a fully realized narrative; tone and imagery linger more than character or plot.</comment>
