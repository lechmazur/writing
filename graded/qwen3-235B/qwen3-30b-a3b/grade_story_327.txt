<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Purple prose emerges in overused abstractions ("layered tranquility," "mosaic of dreams"); metaphors occasionally drift toward generic mysticism rather than striking originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but relies on familiar spiritual arc tropes; lingers through atmosphere rather than narrative innovation.</comment>
