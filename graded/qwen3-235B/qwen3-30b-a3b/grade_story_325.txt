<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity is vivid but lacks psychological depth; motivation to explore ancient pathways feels externally imposed rather than organically connected to her botany obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through fantastical reveals but sacrifices internal logic; abrupt plant rebellion in the finale strains coherence despite effective pacing in earlier sections.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush sensory details (glowing leaves, crackling roots) create immersive atmosphere; some elements like "high altitude" remain underexploited beyond generic mystique.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</comment><grade>Metaphors (e.g., "reel's veins") and symbolic tension between science/mysticism resonate, but emotional impact diluted by overt theatricality over nuanced character stakes.</grade>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original fusion of botany and occult mechanics stands out; some phrasing ("fickle loyalty," "comically serious") feels troped; avoids clich√©s but doesn't fully subvert them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a surreal narrative but prioritize atmospheric spectacle over thematic substance; premise's potential outpaces execution in character and plotting.</comment>
