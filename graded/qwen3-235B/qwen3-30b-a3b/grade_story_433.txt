<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's hardheadedness drives her persistence, but her wholeheartedly broken self remains superficially sketched; internal conflict lacks depth beyond surface grief. Her choice to reject power aligns with seeking solace but feels abrupt without gradual emotional evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemption arc but rushes the emotional stakes; scraps of prophecy as method feel underdeveloped. Snow days frame the story but don't organically connect to the gallery's surreal nature, creating tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral art gallery as a dreamlike space and snow's fragility evoke mood, but the library's corner feels jarringly static. Burning parchment and "demure audacity" concept aren't fully integrated into the setting's logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like snowflakes and "price" mirror internal conflict effectively. Ending's refusal of power offers thematic cohesion, but emotional resonance is diluted by overly abstract grief; subtext about healing through restraint is present but thin.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stylized prose evokes atmosphere but occasionally veers into ornate "snowflake" clich√©s. Subversion of the "magic artifact" trope (choosing loss over power) is original, but grief portrayal relies on expected descriptors rather than nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are woven with atmospheric coherence, but key connections (e.g., gallery impermanence to character's brokenness) remain unexplored. The ending lingers but leans on familiar "hope in small choices" tropes rather than revelatory depth.</comment>
