<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but thinly layered; actions lack psychological depth or distinct voice despite poetic language. The internal conflict of shame versus liberation remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from decoding to epiphany but lacks narrative tension or stakes; cause/effect between DNA sequence and fracturing walls remains unearned. Pacing is static despite vivid moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich with neon/orchard contrasts, but the cyberpunk underworld lacks functional coherence. Sensory details overwhelm rather than clarify the setting’s relationship to the character’s arc.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor (e.g., "symphony of singularly plural truths") create some resonance, but overreliance on abstract phrasing undermines emotional immediacy. Themes are stated more than dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("prison walls of shame," "singularly plural") and reliance on cyberpunk/DNA tropes suggest formulaic construction. Subtext feels artificially imposed rather than organically mined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements serve as symbolic props rather than narrative drivers; brevity masks underdeveloped ideas. The closing image lacks transformative weight despite lyrical attempts.</comment>
