<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is defined by guilt and sarcasm, but reincarnation element feels underutilized and inconsistent with her role as a goldfish caretaker; motivation to disrupt tradition is clear but lacks tangible connection to her past lives.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has a minimal arc but relies on contrived storm plot device; connection between finding the soldier’s arm and resolving her internal conflict feels abrupt despite symbolic resonance; pacing is uneven in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly oppressive, with sensory details (smell of paper, storm sounds) enhancing the theme of stagnation; the library’s physicality as a “tomb” and the soldier’s decay work cohesively to mirror emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (recipe as rebellion, soldier as fractured self) are effective but occasionally heavy-handed; ending provides closure but lacks gut-punch impact; subtext about history’s weight is present but thinly developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clichés but occasionally borders on poetic vagueness (e.g., “echo of a soldier’s forgotten arm”); emotional complexity feels surface-level, leaning on descriptive lushness over nuanced psychological layers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements are woven together with thematic ambition, but execution feels strained by constraints; the doctor’s chart and reincarnation premise lack integration, highlighting the tension between imposed requirements and organic storytelling.</comment>
