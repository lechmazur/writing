<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's background as orphan is referenced but not deeply explored; motivations are clear but emotional layers remain underdeveloped despite the brooch interaction revealing resilience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows from entry to resolution but pacing feels rushed during temple trials; cause-effect connections exist but some narrative transitions lack depth within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory details (glowing vines, shifting brooch) create immersive atmosphere; some generic descriptors prevent higher score.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (brooch as mirror, fruit as test) and thematic resolution; emotional impact is present but not deeply innovative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality in "unwritten calendar" concept and reversed patterns, but relies on semi-familiar fantasy tropes (cursed objects, temple trials); avoids complete formulaicity through thematic nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly work cohesively though some feel underutilized; theme of hope vs. darkness resonates, but tightness of structure occasionally falters under word limit pressures.</comment>
