<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Internal conflict and symbolism (abacus) imply motivation, but lacks psychological depth; character voice is poetic but introspective to a fault, leaving emotional resonance underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progressions via snow patterns and physical movement are coherent but episodic; tension between spiritual reckoning and external action remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific incidents.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually striking synesthetic details (e.g. "ink in a forgotten ledger") create immersive atmosphere; setting-as-metaphor risks overwhelming visceral engagement through excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Powerful extended metaphor structure pays off in final act; lyrical prose elevates thematic weight though occasionally loses momentum; ending achieves emotional paradox of "unraveling as beginning."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original concept executed with stylistic flair, but some overwritten passages ("crumbling bridge" analogy) lean on familiar spiritual redemption tropes rather than fully transcending them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically unified whole despite occasionally feeling like symbolic scaffolding; concise format serves meditative tone but sacrifices deeper character exploration.</comment>
