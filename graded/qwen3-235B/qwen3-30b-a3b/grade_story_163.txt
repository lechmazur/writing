<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks nuance; "bitter optimism" is stated but underexplored. Internal conflict feels simplified rather than deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Fragmented structure mirrors the concept but sacrifices coherence. Pacing alternates between rushed revelations and stagnant poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on generic "alien" descriptors; cloud migration symbolically resonant but underdeveloped as physical phenomenon.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Occasional striking metaphors ("world torn and stitched") undercut by melodramatic line ("reckless precision guided her steps"). Ending feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on inherited sci-fi tropes (AI skepticism, lost labs) without subversion. Prose veers between sparse abstraction and purple patches.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story coheres superficially but lacks thematic urgency. Premise suggests deeper exploration of identity/self-fracture that never materializes.</comment>
