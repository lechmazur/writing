<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's docility juxtaposes his role as 'bruiser', but motivation to 'mold a myth' lacks psychological complexity. Calmness under danger is consistent but underexplored—reaction to baton's truth feels abrupt rather than earned through prior characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot driven effectively by map-piecing action. Twisted resolution connects beginning/end tightly, though baton's sudden betrayal risks thin causal logic. Pacing balances urgency and reflection within constraints, but vine chamber climax feels compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Glyph-etched greenhouse excels in paradoxical decay/vibrancy metaphor. Sensory details (thorn-rustle whispers, poison-bloom scent) immerse readers. Atmosphere deeply supports theme of myth's consuming nature, though drum solos as timeframe remain under-integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ending delivers thematic punch about myth's cost. Metaphors ('mud of reality') and imagery (thorn-parting as surrender) resonate. Subtext about story-hunger is layered, though protagonist's internal conflict remains somewhat externalized rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most AI fingerprints, but 'brash tenderness' of plants veers toward poetic vagueness. Batong's twist subverts resurrection tropes inventively. Prose occasionally overelaborates ('quiet destruction') rather than grounding emotion in specifics, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce thematically—baton and map directly enable myth-cost exploration. Greenhouse functions as both setting and antagonist. Brief length serves as crucible for transformation, though drum solos' purpose feels peripheral rather than essential.</comment>
