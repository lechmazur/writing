<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation (guardianship) is clear but emotional depth feels surface-level; practicality shown through actions but 'voice' lacks distinctiveness; transitions between bard-as-performer and bard-as-guardian are abrupt</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Compelling cause-effect chain (screw → diary → archive) maintains momentum; pacing tightens under word limit but final map transition feels underdeveloped; circular structure strong despite constraints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (hissing steam, bioluminescent ink) create immersive steampunk atmosphere; setting actively shapes plot through mechanical puzzles; street fair contrast with sacred archive effectively deepens tone</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (weight of legacy, "second language" cipher) add thematic resonance; ending achieves emotional payoff through contrast between laughter above and sacredness below; shows rather than tells through mechanical interactions</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but contains occasional ornate phrasing ("breathless longing"); character reasoning leans deterministic rather than organic; metaphors original but execution occasionally veers toward poetic convention</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically (steampunk logic justifies stripped screw's significance); creates thematic dissonance between practicality and legacy that lingers; compression enhances mythic quality rather than limiting impact</comment>
