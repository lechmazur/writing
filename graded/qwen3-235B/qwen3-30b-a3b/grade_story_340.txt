<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sufficient motivation established but emotional depth thin; character's "feisty" trait inconsistently demonstrated beyond quips; reactions align with assigned attributes but lack nuanced exploration of internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through clock/bridge disruptions driving action; pacing uneven in middle; logical cause-effect links weaken during grimoire spell execution; resolution feels slightly truncated yet complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vivid but uneven sensory details (rotting platforms vs. underdeveloped Amazonian elements); setting supports plot but fails to establish distinctive cultural/textural depth for treehouse city; atmosphere often generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotional sincerity undercut by occasional clich√©d phrasing ("weight of responsibility as compass"); effective imagery in bridge/vine transformation metaphor; theme of inherited legacy has resonance but feels surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaicity but relies on familiar exorcist/shadow-mentor tropes; "youthify" spell offers minor subversion; some purple prose ("whisper of ancient magic") and emotional tells weaken authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements function but lack alchemical cohesion; length works against complexity; concept/setting integration stronger than character-development synergy; thematically satisfying but narratively lightweight.</comment>
