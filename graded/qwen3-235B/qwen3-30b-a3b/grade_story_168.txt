<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Comb serves as meaningful childhood link but ruthless trait feels arbitrarily applied; motivations shift rather than evolve; dialogue reveals intellect but inconsistently demonstrates spontaneity; voice lacks distinctiveness despite "polite anarchy" framing</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rock art decoding drives plot but "road trip conversations" method feels artificial in constrained setting; connections between singer's verses create false sense of pacing structure; mystery resolved too swiftly; cause-effect logic strained by abrupt character revelations</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stone circle effectively rendered with specific sensory details (whispering stones, scattered petals); atmosphere supports theme of hidden past; however, some descriptions verge on clich√© (shadows stretching like fingers); timeframe element underutilized</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses compelling metaphors (comb as memory marker, watcher's burden as compass); dialogue contains memorable lines ("breaking glass laughter"); theme of memory vs control emerges but resolution feels didactic; tension between precision and spontaneity well-explored</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Contains poetic language but some phrases trend toward over-ornamentation; emotional resonance stems more from concept than lived experience; certain narrative choices (mysterious stranger departure) feel genre-troppy without subversion; character logic occasionally feels too neatly constructed</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Forced cohesion between elements - flower arranging mainly cosmetic; some elements (singer's verses timeframe) feel imposed rather than organic; comb and watcher's burden carry most thematic weight; brief length enhances mystery but undermines character depth</comment>
