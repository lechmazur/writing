<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Piecemeal motivations ("restore sacred practices"), underdeveloped backstory. Crooked hope is present but insufficiently grounded. Voice is distinctive but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loose cause-effect chain between tea leaves, drawing, and "common ground" revelation. Some coherence in spiral motif, but fragmented pacing due to excessive descriptive tangents disrupting forward momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine's sensory details (brass, steam) effectively establish machinery-driven decay. Timeframe during paint drying is arbitrary and unused. "Crooked hope" tone contradicts mechanical setting's determinism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphoric interplay between spirals, tea leaves, and frayed edges. Some forced comparisons; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on symbolic abstraction over visceral human experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction excess ("compass-shaped tea leaves"). Jester's paradoxical role shows ingenuity but risks pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overshadow narrative cohesion. Some elements (crumpled drawing, steam mechanics) work synergistically, while others (paint drying, sacred practices) feel arbitrarily tethered.</comment>
