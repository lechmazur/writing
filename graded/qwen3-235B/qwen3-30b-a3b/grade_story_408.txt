<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivations are hinted at but underdeveloped; internal conflict between atonement and control lacks nuance. "Valiantly bored" is stated but unevenly manifested in actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elias’s encounter with refugees drives the plot forward but resolution feels rushed. Connection between the storm, tradition, and legacy is suggestive but underexplored. Pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay and isolation is evocative but sparse sensory details limit immersion. The storm’s role in shaping character and setting is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (maps, nail) and theme of ambiguous morality are effective, but emotional resonance is diluted by overly expository narration. Ending lacks punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but treads familiar ground with refugee savior narratives. The nail’s dual symbolism is fresh; some phrasing (e.g., “sagging branches”) feels generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack depth. The compressed form feels limiting rather than deliberate. Lingering thematic questions are muffled by uneven execution.</comment>
