<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits are vaguely defined; motivations are implied but lack psychological depth, making actions feel abstract rather than emotionally grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative lacks a clear arc; disjointed progression from bookstore to bar performance undermines cohesion within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich, tactile details create a mythic, oppressive atmosphere; the mountain setting and cursed object are evocatively interwoven with sensory precision.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Competent but unremarkable synthesis of elements; the bar-as-cathedral conceit hints at transcendence but lacks narrative payoff to justify the ambitious stylistic flourishes.</comment>
