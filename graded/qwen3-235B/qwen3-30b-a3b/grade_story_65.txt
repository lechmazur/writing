<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; the slapdash nature of the bard isn't deeply explored, and their desperation lacks layered emotional nuance or clear psychological consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but relies on poetic abstraction over concrete cause/effect; some transitions feel forced, though thematic cohesion between disruption and transformation is skillfully implied.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (burnt sugar, trembling earth) creates atmosphere, but the tectonic setting and sacred space remain conceptually underexplored, leaving worldbuilding with aesthetic over structural depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (hourglass, doorplate) resonate; emotional impact exists but leans on lyrical abstraction rather than visceral showing of character interiority or tension resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original concept combining mortality, liminality, and tradition; avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing that slightly dilutes narrative precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are functionally integrated but occasionally feel like symbolic checklist items; tonal consistency elevates cohesion despite occasional thematic diffuseness.</comment>
