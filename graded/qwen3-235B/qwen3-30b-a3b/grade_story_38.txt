<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and poetic nature are established but lack depth; motivation for non-violence is hinted but underdeveloped; reactions to botanical samples and attic are atmospheric but not psychologically revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from trauma to acceptance; pacing struggles balance between rushed transitions and lyrical interludes; subway timeframe and lavender resolution provide structural cohesion but leave some logical gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hauntingly textured atmosphere with sensory-rich details (ink, soil, lavender, subway hum); setting functions as psychological extension of character; whispers and botanical decay masterfully reinforce tone of "empty abundance."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (whispers as roots, silence as currency) evoke emotional resonance; subtext about violence vs. listening drives subtle thematic undercurrent; ending avoids sentimentality but feels slightly formulaic in its resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid imagery elevates material; some phrasing ("storm to dance") risks clich√©; botanical samples avoid trope through precise, grotesque details; voice maintains stylistic consistency but occasionally over-relies on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are thematically interwoven (e.g., lavender counters whispers) but occasionally prioritized for atmosphere over narrative logic; brief length serves poetic vignette approach but weakens emotional payoff.</comment>
