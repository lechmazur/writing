<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's unresolved past is hinted through the coathanger/postcards, but motivation remains abstract. "Uneasy" is superficially portrayed without deeper psychological grounding; emotional shifts feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague cosmic symbolism rather than cause-effect. The fridge/picnic incongruity disrupts coherence. Lurches as plot devices feel arbitrary; ending resolves too neatly for the underdeveloped premise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orbital station imagery is effective but thinly sketched; the fridge as a repository for "human longing" clashes tonally with technical setting. Postcards as metaphysical agents lack atmospheric integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors ("branches of redemption," debris as forgotten stories) elevate the narrative. Emotional resonance emerges through poetic subtext, though some symbolism feels overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids clich√© in tone, but structural patterns (repeating lurches/picnics) risk formulaic repetition. Metaphors are fresh, yet the AI-era anxiety about pattern-seeking feels overly familiar.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The elements cohere thematically but strain plausibility. The brevity works for mood but undermines character/plot development. Leaves intriguing questions about meaning-making, but sacrifices depth.</comment>
