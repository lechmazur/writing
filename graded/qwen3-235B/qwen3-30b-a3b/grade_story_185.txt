<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivations are vague and abstractly stated rather than dramatized. Calmness feels imposed rather than earned, with no concrete reactions to events.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Plot is static, relying on poetic flourishes instead of cause-effect progression. The piano key "action" lacks tangible stakes or resolution within the constrained arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with vivid metaphors ("probabilities coiled like smoke"), but setting remains decorative rather than active. Timelessness weakens narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Striking imagery but uneven impact; cosmic symbolism overshadows thematic clarity. Ending feels arbitrarily placed, undercutting potential resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s in concept but slips into ornate abstraction ("cathedral of numbers and shadows"). Nuanced language contrasts with moments of diffuse abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elements feel compartmentalized rather than synergistic. Ambitious ideas suffer from vague execution; length amplifies rather than refines the fragmentary tone.</comment>
