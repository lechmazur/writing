<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, defined more by symbolic weight than concrete motivations or actions; motivations hinted through metaphors but lack psychological depth or complexity that would make impossible choices feel earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but relies on cryptic progression rather than organic cause/effect; plot mechanics (pattern-forming items, serpent interaction) feel conceptually intact but emotionally inert; resolution lacks closure due to thematic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive atmosphere with visceral sensory details; storm-lashed setting and lighthouse prison create oppressive yet haunting mood that amplifies existential themes; setting itself functions as a character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolic layering through objects, mirrors, and recurring motifs; tone vacillates between poetic and opaque; ending possesses bittersweet resonance but lacks emotional specificity to fully realize "joyful agony" concept.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("grudgingly sweet memory") and predictable supernatural prison tropes undercut originality; metaphors fresh but occasionally derivative; emotional depth conveyed through imagery rather than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but lack integration as thematic anchors; tight word count showcases stylistic economy but at expense of emotional payoff; story lingers via atmosphere but fails to transform assigned constraints into profound revelation.</comment>
