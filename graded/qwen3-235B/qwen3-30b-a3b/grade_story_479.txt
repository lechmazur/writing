<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are conceptually tied to her actions, but deeper emotional layers remain abstract. The "glamorous undertaker" persona is present but underexplored beyond surface details. Internal conflict is implied but lacks visceral embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot exists as a cyclical ritual rather than a progression. The beginning/end connection is thematic rather than structural, sacrificing traditional arc in favor of meditative stasis. Pacing unevenly alternates between lush description and philosophical assertions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking juxtaposition of antiquated tradition (brass tape, caskets) with futuristic archive creates dissonant beauty. Sensory details (reflective screen, trembling metal, pigment hues) immerse readers in a tactile paradox of decay and preservation. The setting operates as character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Imagery ("social network archive as digital tomb") and symbolism (elongation as narrative act) resonate powerfully. While some concepts feel didactic, the central metaphor of hidden significance in mundane acts carries emotional weight. The ending's quiet hope lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original in its anachronistic synthesis of Victorian funerary art and modern digital culture. Avoids clich√©s through precise details (sequined gloves, flagged uploads). Occasional conceptual redundancy ("fruitlessly patient" stated rather than shown) but overall possesses distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elegantly constructed but constrained by conceptual priorities over narrative momentum. Elements cohere thematically rather than causally. Achieves atmospheric intensity but lacks dynamic transformation. Lingers in memory as tone poem rather than story.</comment>
