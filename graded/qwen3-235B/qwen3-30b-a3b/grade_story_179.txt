<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic; motivations are implied rather than substantiated through concrete behavior. While envy as motivating force is clear, "confident" aspects remain underdemonstrated in actions or thoughts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence across transformation arc, though climactic moments lack sufficient buildup within constrained word count. Beginning-middle-end structure functional but somewhat compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through sensory specifics â€“ golden hums, slick wax surfaces, coloring rituals. Atmosphere powerfully conveys psychological states through environmental metaphors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphorical resonance between physical objects and emotional states. Subtext about imperfection as strength elevates narrative. Occasional overwritten passages slightly dilute impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>While conceptually original, some phrasing patterns recur (e.g., "echo of yearning"). Avoids genre tropes but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction over psychological specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate with remarkable synergy, particularly ruler-fingerprint-yearning triad. Story's thematic intentionality exceeds its psychological realism.</comment>
