<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's burnt-out state is atmospheric but lacks tangible actions reflecting trauma; motivation (dethroning fear) is stated but underexplored through specific memories or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is aided by tight focus but suffers slight pacing issues; renewal arc is abrupt, and the cliff photo's significance is underdeveloped despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dark matter diner vibrantly realizes atmosphere with tactile details (seaweed's texture, neon flickers), but setting's connection to "shared anxieties" remains undernourished.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mix of surrealism and introspective dialogue ("Wisdom’s a mischievous thing") creates lingering resonance; metaphors (arc as bridge between void and agency) enrich subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Occasional poetic overreach ("memory of a storm") edges toward purple prose, but most imagery feels fresh; emotional subtlety (shifting arcs) overrides explicit exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story coheres despite density, but some elements (dark matter diner’s role, arcs’ mechanics) feel arbitrarily chosen rather than inevitable within the narrative logic.</comment>
