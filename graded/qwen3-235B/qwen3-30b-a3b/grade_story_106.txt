<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character shift lacks nuance; "objectively biased" trait isn't clearly demonstrated. Grandma's quote feels forced as motivation. Emotional transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but feels rushed. The moment of inspiration lacks adequate buildup within the word constraints. Stamps-as-keys concept drives action but mechanical logic of how they function remains unexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses strong sensory details (salt, decay, flickering lights) but setting feels decorative rather than integral. Underwater location doesn't interact meaningfully with thematic elements about boundaries or transformation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolic use of stamps and quilt patches shows potential but relies on overused metaphors ("map of possibilities"). Ending veers toward cliché rather than surprising emotional resonance. Theme of erasing boundaries is inconsistently woven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Contains clichéd phrases ("heart pounded," "quiet defiance") and predictable emotional beats. The "rebel against stagnation" arc follows familiar templates. Sensory details often feel generic rather than imaginatively specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements forced into service rather than organically integrated. Conceptual framework feels imposed rather than emergent. Writing style prioritizes ornamental description over narrative momentum or psychological depth.</comment>
