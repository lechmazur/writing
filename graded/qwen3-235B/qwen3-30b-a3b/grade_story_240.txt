<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflicts are underexplored; her "voice" blends into the narrative rather than asserting distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc, driven by the hammer and song. Cause-effect (miracles causing memory loss) is logical, though the ending feels abrupt despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is lush and immersive, with sensory details enhancing mood. The forest’s decay mirrors the villagers’ plight, though the altitude of “perched” in the timeframe is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice and legacy resonate deeply. The ending is emotionally poignant but lacks subtext about creation’s ethical cost. Symbolism (hammer as prison/key) is effective but overt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in concept (blacksmith soothsayer), though some phrasing (“clawed at the sky”) leans familiar. Tension between nature/superstition is fresh but edges toward purple prose at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cohesive and purposeful; each element interlocks. The brevity underscores thematic weight but leaves some threads (e.g., lost civilization’s history) underdeveloped.</comment>
