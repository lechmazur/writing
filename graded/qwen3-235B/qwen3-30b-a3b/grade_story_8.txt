<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's nobility lacks concrete definition beyond abstract actions; motivation to merge logic/madness is clear but inner conflict underdeveloped through specific memories or stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from solitary acts to communal dialogue but lacks overt conflict; the spiral metaphor structures the narrative cohesively though the resolution feels passive rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid tactile details (smell of lapis, hum of stones) create atmosphere, but the timeframe between lectures remains atmospherically inert rather than shaping the story's rhythm.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors merge cosmic and mundane effectively; ending satisfies through cyclical imagery, though emotional connection to the noble himself remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some ornate prose ("benign ferocity," "empirically rebellious") feels overdetermined; avoids genre tropes but occasionally substitutes metaphorical density for narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve theme over plot; the story's strength lies in conceptual resonance rather than tight storytelling or character complexity within the limited space.</comment>
