<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth; the ranger's obsession is consistent, but internal conflict/stakes feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pacing is unevenâ€”seasonal shifts and plot progression are forced without sufficient emotional or narrative buildup; abrupt ending undermines structural cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid imagery but relies too heavily on surface-level descriptors; mood doesn't fully align with the stated "detached devotion," often feeling more manic than detached.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (seasons as control, globe as mirror) but emotional resonance weakened by excessive exposition; ending is conceptually strong but narratively predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh combinations (plastic cup lid, confessional tapes) but occasionally lapses into ornate prose and generic emotional shorthand.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story possesses conceptual ambition and a haunting central metaphor but struggles with pacing and underdeveloped connections between key elements.</comment>
