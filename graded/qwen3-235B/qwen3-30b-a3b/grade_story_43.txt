<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character’s loud introversion lacks behavioral specificity; motivation to “spark reunion with courage” feels abstract rather than emotionally grounded, weakening the protagonist’s psychological trajectory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on poetic symbolism over narrative causality; the climactic awakening of emblems via CD strains logic, though the circular structure (decay-renewal) provides minimal coherence within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and hauntingly original, using synesthetic fog and neon decay to externalize internal desolation; sensory immersion overshadows underdeveloped temporal context (“after last human story”).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose wields striking metaphors (“cracks mirroring the world,” “defiant light”) that elevate thematic resonance; emotional impact emerges subtly through layered symbols rather than explicit sentiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid imagery occasionally curdles into self-satisfied abstraction (“crooked hope”); avoids total cliché through surreal setting conceptualization but falters with recycled “courage” motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story functions as a potent elegy for lost idealism, though its brevity sacrifices character depth and narrative plausibility; the neon cathedral’s rebirth lingers as a provocative visual metaphor.</comment>
