<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Peculiar yet underexplored traits (telepathy, glacier obsession) create surface intrigue but lack psychological depth; motivations stated rather than dramatized through conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragmented vignettes substitute for plot - repetitive seasonal framing creates false sense of arc; pivotal 'message in ice' revelation feels unearned and undercontextualized.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory tapestry (burnt coffee, thrumming engines) creates haunting atmosphere where every object resonates with thematic tension between decay and resilience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Potent symbolism (cloaks, tools) delivers memorable imagery but heavy-handed thematic declarations undercut subtlety; emotional impact diluted by excessive telling vs showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise compromised by occasionally clich√©d phrasing ("whispers of earth", "weight of secrets") and overly symmetrical structure that feels algorithmically generated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Successful as mood piece but lacks narrative urgency; clever elements exist in parallel rather than collision; thematic coherence outweighs dramatic immediacy.</comment>
