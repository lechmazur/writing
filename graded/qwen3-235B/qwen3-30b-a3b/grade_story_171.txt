<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through lyrical precision, though some phrases verge on ornamental abstraction. Maintains distinctive voice despite occasional overwritten passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>Cohesion achieved through recurring symbols, but conceptual overload dilutes emotional urgency. Final paragraph's thematic crystallization elevates lingering impact.</grade>
