<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from isolation to action is present but shallow; her motivations are poetic but lack psychological depth, relying on abstraction rather than concrete emotional logic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels truncated; the leap into the unknown is thematically cohesive, though the rapid resolution of tension sacrifices nuanced progression for poetic brevity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Visionary prose occasionally veers into purple prose; clichéd motifs ("leap of faith") and atmospheric abstraction dilute originality despite strong worldbuilding gestures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion through lyrical unity, though brevity constraints expose uneven integration of elements like the "borrowed books" timeframe; ambitious thematic synthesis occasionally outpaces execution.</comment>
