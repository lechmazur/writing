<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than emotionally resonant; motivations stem from assigned concept rather than internal complexity; 'patiently frantic' attribute mentioned but not fully integrated into behavioral patterns or psychological makeup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-action plot achieves loose arc within tight constraints, but pivotal moment feels compressed rather than earned; conceptual alignment between 'mirage of safety' and lightning-reflection task drives momentum, though cause-effect logic occasionally strained by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exquisitely rendered sensory details (decaying air, skeletal remains, prism's kaleidoscope) create immersive, thematically resonant atmosphere; 'sky burial site' and 'euphoric agitation' particularly effective; 'during reading' timeframe inconsistently applied.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric language and philosophical undercurrents elevate impact; emotionally ambiguous ending invites reflection; lyrical prose occasionally veers into ornateness; shows through vivid imagery but struggles to fully embed some conceptual gestures.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unusual combinations, though phrases like 'edge of reality' approach overfamiliarity; sensory details mostly specific, but 'frayed like reality itself' exemplifies borderline overwrought abstraction; tone consistent but risks self-indulgence in dense prose passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with thematic purpose rather than mechanical checklist; lyrical density sometimes hinders clarity but serves atmospheric goals; brief format leveraged effectively to explore existential tension; thematic resonance lingers but emotional payoff feels incomplete.</comment>
