<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has atmospheric presence but lacks internal consistency; carelessness wanes without clear motivation shift. The glove's emotional significance feels imposed rather than earned through developed reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows eerie logic but suffers from compressed progression; key emotional beats emerge abruptly, undermining the gradual transformation required for thematic weight within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting's sensory details (pulsing spirals, mossy tension) masterfully create psychological unease. The orchard’s living qualities perfectly mirror the protagonist’s internal unraveling and reintegration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</comment>Storytelling uses elegant metaphors (grove as mind labyrinth, gloves as identity vessels) that deepen themes, though some abstract imagery (collapsing labyrinth) feels overwrought rather than organically resonant.</grade>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</comment>Language avoids overt clichés but occasionally drifts into self-conscious lyricism. The dreamy resignation trope has subtle subversions, though the postcard/memories conceit remains derivative of mythic archetypes.</grade>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</comment>Cohesion exists but feels strained by ambitious scope; thematic threads about memory and freedom remain tantalizingly unresolved despite the poetic surface closure.</comment>
