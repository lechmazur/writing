<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but development feels rushed; the glove as a symbol of servitude-turned-rebellion is effective but lacks nuanced emotional progression.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with logical cause-effect, but the compressed word limit leads to abrupt transitions between key revelations and emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary is vividly atmospheric but sensory details are underutilized beyond auditory imagery; the setting supports the plot but lacks immersive depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses strong symbolism (glove, sanctuary) and subtext about confronting mortality; however, the "final laugh" theme feels underexplored compared to its narrative potential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies slightly on familiar gothic tropes (secret confessions, oppressive institutions); prose is purposeful but occasionally tilts toward generic descriptors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All elements coalesce into a thematically consistent story, though some (e.g., voice notes, auditions) feel strained under the word limit; ending resonates thematically but may sacrifice depth for brevity.</comment>
