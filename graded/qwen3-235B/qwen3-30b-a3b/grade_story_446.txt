<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's obsession and motivation are clear but psychological depth lacks nuance. The gambler's internal conflict between rage and acceptance is underdeveloped despite poetic descriptions of his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear arc from obsession to epiphany, but pacing feels rushed in key transitions (e.g., sudden archive discovery). The "hydrolysis of petals" as plot device stretches credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Breathtaking atmosphere through precise sensory details (firefly glow, decaying petals), but the firefly breeding grounds' symbolic connection to "unbecoming" remains superficial despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical subtext about memory and impermanence. The ledger-to-testament transformation is moving, though the ending leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("liquid starlight," "whispered by dying alchemist"). Conceptual originality is strong, but emotional authenticity wavers between showing/telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically around loss and transformation. The tight word limit sacrifices secondary depth but serves the story's mythic brevity. Ending resonates as deliberately open-ended rather than truncated.</comment>
