<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like sassiness and academic mischief are stated but underdeveloped; motivation drives plot but feels underexplored beyond surface rebelliousness. Actions align with goals but lack nuanced emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear through-line from calibrating order to unleashing chaos; pacing is tight but some cause-effect connections (e.g., Polaroid mechanics) lack explanatory grounding within the world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of sterile office contrasts with surreal sensory details (burnt toast, void skies); twilight timeframe deepens atmosphere but isn't fully leveraged as a narrative catalyst.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (camera as rebellion symbol) and lyrical prose elevate impact; thematically cohesive but occasionally relies on familiar archetypes (mad genius trope).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original conceits (reality-fractionating camera, calibration bureaucracy) standout; occasional purple prose and underutilized elements (e.g., cooking) suggest formulaic tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Impressive cohesion given constraints; elements serve the theme but inconsistently deepen character (e.g., "sassy cook" feels extrinsic to core narrative).</comment>
