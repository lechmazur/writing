<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains underdeveloped; "blunt heretic" trait inconsistently displayed, motivation tied to plot mechanics rather than organic psychology, emotional stakes remain abstract despite teddy bear symbolism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot driven by conceptual momentum but sacrifices coherence—sudden void transformation and cryptic battle mechanics feel arbitrary rather than earned. Pacing oscillates between rushed exposition and atmospheric padding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative but superficially rendered setting combines arcane and financial motifs with unsettling beauty; sensory details (parchment scent, void's tactile absence) anchor mood, but temporal paradoxes ("outdated stock ticker" in ancient temple) undermine logical cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose uses paradoxes and recursive imagery to explore memory versus salvation; emotional impact emerges through symbolic actions (stuffing-as-map) rather than direct exposition. Ending delivers thematic resonance about redefining "victory."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Struggles with tonal whiplash—mythic language clashes with stock market jargon. While glyph-storm omniscience offers originality, teddy bear's sentience emerges without foundation. Avoids clichés through surreal juxtapositions but sacrifices internal logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition overrides narrative clarity—elements like stock ticker feel forcibly grafted to temple mysticism. Technical details (puzzle mechanics, code interpretation) remain vague, leaving cohesion dependent on poetic abstraction rather than structural integrity.</comment>
