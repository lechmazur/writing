<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (sheltering kindness) is hinted but mostly externalized; internal conflict resolving "fervent apathy" with sudden moral awakening feels underdeveloped despite memorable imagery</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tight 500-word arc exists but relies heavily on abrupt revelations; staircase discovery and chamber vision compress narrative momentum in ways that strain coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory marriage of grime and bioluminescence creates immersive paradox; neon-smog contrasts with fungal glow effectively establish thematic dissonance</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High concept density overwhelms emotional nuance; cohesion exists thematically but not fully in execution due to compressed structure</comment>
