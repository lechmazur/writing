<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like 'earnestly frivolous' and 'king without a throne' create intriguing duality, but motivations remain abstract rather than deeply human. Actions align with assigned elements but lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative traces a circular arc from solver to dissolved self, but pacing unevenly compresses time. Betrayal catalyzes transformation logically but lacks visceral progression. Resolution ties concepts neatly but feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lantern-light alchemy and sandstone textures create haunting atmosphere. Sensory detail density borders on overwhelming, but the maze-as-mirror motif amplifies thematic resonance through setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror, fracture, dust) resonate beyond surface narrative. The ending’s philosophical revelation is poetically delivered but risks feeling predetermined rather than organically discovered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but leans on mystical-symbolic tropes with occasional over-ornamentation. Wedding proposals feel arbitrarily whimsical rather than organically absurd. Emotional notes are evoked through imagery more than character interiority.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive through symbolic framework but strained by brevity. Assigned elements shape tone effectively but occasionally feel like checklist items (e.g., weddings). Ending lingers conceptually but lacks gut-punch.</comment>
