<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's rashness and motivation are clear but transitions abrupt; growth feels underdeveloped despite symbolic resonance of postcards with his transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot uses moving day and postcards effectively to drive transformation, but pacing falters in conveying Kael’s internal shifts; resolution ties back cohesively but lacks narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (rain, humming caverns) enhance the mystical atmosphere, but deeper integration of fortress’s symbolism with character’s past would strengthen thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (postcards as keys) and theme of small things holding cosmic weight are effective, but lyrical prose occasionally veers into abstraction; ending resonates but lacks emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends mystical elements with introspection but leans on familiar motifs (dawn of awareness). Sensory details are vivid yet occasionally overwritten; subverts predictability only partially.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly weighted; prose style occasionally hinders clarity. Conceptual depth present but execution lacks sustained emotional or narrative urgency.</comment>
