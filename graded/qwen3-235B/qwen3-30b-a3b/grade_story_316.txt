<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's timidity is shown but not fully explored; the "unapologetic" aspect is underdeveloped. Motivation through maternal promise is clear but lacks emotional depth. Actions align with traits but transition feels abrupt. Seamstress identity shapes imagery more than concrete decisions.</comment>

Beginning-to-end connection exists but feels perfunctory. Pacing prioritizes images over emotional beats. Action-method connection exists but feels contrived rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ancient/modern fusion creates visual interest but lacks sensory richness. Atmosphere leans heavily on poetic abstractions ("whispers of grief") over immersive specifics. Setting supports theme but remains more decorative than integral.

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Literary devices are present but often predictable. Ending connects to beginning thematically but lacks emotional wallop. Central conflict between promise and capability exists but remains surface-level. Writing style shows effort toward lyricism but occasionally tips into purple prose. Message about collective healing isn't sufficiently dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Phrases like "scattered harmony" and "tapestry of shared pain" feel clich√©d. Story follows healing journey template without subverting expectations. Emotional progression relies on telling over showing. Sensory details lack specificity.
