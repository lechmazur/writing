<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains thinly developed—motivation shift from mapping weather to existential discovery lacks emotional grounding, and "tactically reckless" attribute only thinly realized through paperclip choice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through footage and diary reveals, but pacing lags in critical moments (e.g., library’s collapse) and key transitions (e.g., footage flicker to shadow) feel abrupt within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere richly rendered through tactile details (crackling air, brittle pages) and the library-as-giant’s-spine metaphor, but setting’s symbolic connection to the desert’s "memory" remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Powerful imagery (book as tomb, gradience as force) elevates thematic resonance, but subtext relies on heavy-handed exposition (e.g., diary’s "not a metaphor") rather than organic showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with original metaphors (desert as "breathing" dunes) and cohesive tone, but occasional overdescription (e.g., "giant’s bones") veers toward formulaic grandeur rather than sustained innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story hinges on intriguing premise, but forced integration of elements (e.g., paperclip’s convenience, gradience’s vague threat) weakens cohesion; ending’s philosophical weight feels unearned.</comment>
