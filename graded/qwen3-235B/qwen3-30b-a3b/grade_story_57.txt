<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Passive traits dominate, but internal conflict between submission and emergent agency feels underexplored; the character's actions lack sufficient grounding in stated motivations.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on contrived eavesdropping and abrupt liquification; cause-effect mechanics strain plausibility despite the tight arc; pacing rushes the protagonist's transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements strain toward symbolic unity but remain loosely tethered; brief length exposes rather than enhances thematic development; stylistic ambition outpaces structural cohesion.</comment>
