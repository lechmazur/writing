<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped characters; motivations lack emotional depth. Characters function as plot devices rather than rounded individuals with consistent reasoning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Disjointed beginning; abrupt resolution. Pacing favors poetic description over structural momentum, weakening narrative completeness in the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create immersion but uneven integration between cybernetic setting and myth themes. Timeframe through painting is ambiguous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (myths as blueprints) and symbolic telescope use effective. Subtext hinted at but emotionally underdeveloped; ending lacks weight despite lyrical finish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Blends myth/tech concepts inventively. Some overwritten phrases ("bioluminescent veins") verge on clich√©, but the core twist subverts expectations effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ambient strengths offset structural weaknesses. Memorable ideas undermined by inconsistent integration of assigned elements and underdeveloped character arcs.</comment>
