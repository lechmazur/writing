<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's poetically rational trait is hinted but underdeveloped; motivation to control destiny is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced action; transitions between ghostwriter's internal conflict and external actions lack emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot arcs from decoding journals to exposing the politician, but cause-effect between fungal setting and narrative progression is vague; pacing uneven, with abrupt shifts like the orchestra's abrupt silence disrupting coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent orchard creates vivid, eerie atmosphere that mirrors chaos; however, orchestra tuning timeframe feels arbitrarily placed rather than shaping mood or plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("ink bleeding like a wound") and subtextual themes of truth vs. deception; emotional impact diluted by overly abstract prose; ending resonates but lacks visceral connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rich imagery occasionally veers into purple prose ("dance of specters"); coded stanzas and bioluminescence are inventive, but ghostwriter's internal logic feels mechanistic rather than viscerally human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Eerie atmosphere and thematic tension linger, but over-reliance on abstract symbolism overshadows narrative clarity; tighter integration of elements (e.g., orchestra's role) would enhance cohesion.</comment>
