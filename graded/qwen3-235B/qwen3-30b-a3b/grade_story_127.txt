<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; emotional logic in the knight's shift feels rushed despite hints of nuance in Lira's internal conflict and use of memory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but occasionally hampered by abrupt transitions between past and present; the arc resolves effectively yet feels slightly compressed, leaving key emotional beats underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge atmosphere is evocative with specific sensory details (gaslight, gears) but underutilizes its potential to deepen tone; coral imagery integrates with theme but feels loosely connected to setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through metaphor (rust/coral/trust) and subtle symbolism; ending feels earned but lacks layered subtext to elevate the theme beyond surface-level reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar emotional arcs; prose is lush yet purposeful; some metaphorical connections border on predictable despite generally fresh imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>All elements integrate cohesively, though coral texture method and steampunk setting feel less essential; emotional impact lingers, but the story's brevity sacrifices deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
