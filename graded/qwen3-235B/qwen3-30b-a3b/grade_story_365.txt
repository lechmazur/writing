<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's deflated state and lost visions anchor motivation, but backstory remains too abstract; internal conflict is poignant but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ritual action drives the plot, but pacing falters in the climax; the circular structure works but feels rushed due to word constraints.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Creative use of elements creates cohesion; themes of loss and acceptance linger, though some components (e.g., "dreamlike invitations") could be more central.</comment>
