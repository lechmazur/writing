<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's impulsive yet rational nature is stated but thinly dramatized; his transformation into different roles during the performance shows versatility, but deeper psychological nuance and consistent behavioral logic from his attribute are missing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from discovery to reenactment, but pivotal moments (e.g., hidden chamber's revelation) feel compressed; thematic payoff is strong, but some causal links lack textured development within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ruined palace's sensory details (oil scent, fractured light) masterfully evoke decay and memory; "ancient Chinese" specificity remains underexplored, weakening cultural resonance despite atmospheric strength.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (sunlight as ruin/rebirth) and layered themes (art as historical reclamation) create emotional heft; ending avoids sentimentality while delivering catharsis through symbolic precision.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("mosaic of anxiety") and predictable contrasts (ruin/resilience); concept pairing (oil extraction + art) is fresh, but execution leans on familiar tragedy-into-redemption arcs without deeper subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly in execution; the tattered dress and oil-extraction framework are indispensably potent, while the chameleon actor's role occasionally feels contrived rather than organically urgent.</comment>
