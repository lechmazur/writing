<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract descriptors over demonstrable actions; motivation shifts abruptly between conservation and destruction without sufficient psychological grounding. The voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot pivots on underdeveloped revelation about infected butterflies; cause-effect logic between Morse code urgency and viral threat feels rushed. Pacing strains coherence within word constraints, particularly the abrupt climax involving unexplained distillation unit mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Steampunk submarine elements offer visceral soundscape (groaning gears, engine roars) but lack integration with plot mechanics. Atmospheric hints at geopolitical conflict remain superficial, failing to shape sensory immersion or character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like highlighter pen as failed relic hold surface-level symbolism, but emotional beats rely on stated abstractions ("weight of love and loss") rather than earned imagery. Central conflict lacks thematic complexity beyond binary moral choice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Original concept pairing bioluminescent butterflies with steampunk epidemiology is undermined by clich√©d tropes (isolated genius healing the world). Purple prose in mechanical descriptions ("battered marvel") distracts from core tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</question><comment>Excessively ornamental language competes with narrative clarity. Assigned elements function as checkboxes rather than organic components; themes of sacrifice and ethical ambiguity remain underexplored within tight structure.</comment>
