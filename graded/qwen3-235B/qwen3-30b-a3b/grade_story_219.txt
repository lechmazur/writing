<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character remains archetypal; motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond symbolic function, lacking humanizing details or psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Circular structure works conceptually but execution feels compressed; cause-effect logic is abstract rather than visceral, weakening narrative propulsion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vividly dreamlike atmosphere with strong sensory texture; setting functions as an extension of thematic concerns rather than a tangible environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism and resonant metaphors (e.g., swan as consciousness map), but emotional impact is diffused through abstraction rather than earned intimacy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are conceptually fused but cohesion comes at cost of narrative immediacy; length suits contemplative tone but limits emotional payoff.</comment>
