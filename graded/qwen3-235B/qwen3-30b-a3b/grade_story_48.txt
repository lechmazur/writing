<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation remains consistent but lacks layered complexity; voice feels poetic yet underdevelops human emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Story maintains a cyclical structure but leans too heavily on abstract moments instead of organic plot progression within the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends ethereal and mechanical well, but some details (e.g., ship's contradictions) lean on vagueness rather than precise imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment><comment>Moments of poetic resonance and subtext (e.g., "remember") are undercut by occasional abstraction ("translate silence into something held") diluting emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally stumbles into lyrical repetition ("etched in a language no one remembered" twice echoes structurally); metaphors feel fresh but inconsistently grounded.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements serve the story's philosophical core, but tighter integration of the pirate captain's subplot could elevate cohesion and thematic weight.</comment>
