<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation; deputy's apathy vs. sudden yearning lacks emotional grounding despite symbolic gestures with twist tie and bees.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ideas overrun structure; elliptical pacing loses narrative momentum. Artifact theft/resolution feels perfunctory despite poetic transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Richly visualized but unconvincing; cathedral/orchard fusion lacks ecological logic, undermining immersive potential of "petrichor" and bee vibrations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Compounded potential and frustration; elements like cathedral transformation and bee communication could power stronger narrative.</comment>
