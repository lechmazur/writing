<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits exist but lack nuance; motivation is implied rather than examined; reactions to objects feel abstract without emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot flows atmospherically but lacks strong cause-effect mechanics; the 400-word constraint exposes underdeveloped arcs despite poetic linkage of elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details immerse readers; setting/timeframe fusion creates haunting tension; atmosphere elevates the narrative beyond structural weaknesses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (mercury measuring decay) and layered themes resonate; ending feels thematically purposeful but leans overly sentimental; conflict remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements create cohesion through tone rather than narrative drive; the story's conceptual ambition outpaces its execution within the compressed scope.</comment>
