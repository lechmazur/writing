<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; muteness isn't fully woven into actions beyond symbolic gestures. Motivation exists abstractly but lacks nuanced demonstration through character-driven choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic arc with a beginning and end, but pacing feels compressed. Transition between dimensions lacks gradual buildup, undermining emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive atmosphere with sensory details (e.g., "prismatic shadows," "scent of old ink"). The setting's decay mirrors the protagonist's journey, though the harbor's role feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elegant use of symbolism (comet as guidance, silence as strength). Subtext about finding meaning in chaos is clear, but emotional connection to the courier remains distant.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on poetic vagueness over distinct originality (e.g., "shifting dimensions"). Prose is lush yet risks veering into ornate abstraction without grounding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>All elements present and interacting, but cohesion wavers (e.g., comet’s role feels tacked on). The thematic core resonates, yet the brevity prevents full exploration of interwoven ideas.</comment>
