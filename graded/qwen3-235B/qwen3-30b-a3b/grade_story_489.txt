<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Abstract "aggressively kind" attribute shapes actions but lacks human complexity; motivation drives plot yet feels underexplored beyond its conceptual role; no distinct voice as narrator.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic cause-effect but fragmented pacing disrupts traditional arc; whale's call feels contrived within word limit; closing gestures at resolution without earned emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually hypnotic setting where sensory details (breath as wind, glass vibrations) masterfully blend supernatural tension with physical decay; the hourglass-timeframe synchronizes with lighthouse's awakening to create urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism in plastic whistle as bridge between mundane/divine; subtext about preserving intangible heritage resonates; ending's metaphoric strength elevates thematic coherence despite abstract execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Occasional overwritten phrases ("heartbeat of its own") undercut otherwise striking imagery; metaphors occasionally feel predetermined rather than organically discovered; avoids genre clich√©s through surreal juxtaposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements serve story's emotional core more than mechanical plot; brevity creates haunting residue; ambitious structure occasionally strains under multiple concepts but rewards contemplation.</comment>
