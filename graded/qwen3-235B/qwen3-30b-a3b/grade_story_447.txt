<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; Mabel's "dutifully defiant" stance lacks nuanced human complexity, with symbolic objects only superficially revealing inner conflict. Her role drives the plot but lacks distinct psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Premise drives plot but suffers from uneven pacing and rushed resolution. The bulletins’ deterioration concept could deepen stakes, yet cause-effect logic remains intact within the constrained word limit despite feeling abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details like "amber prison" and "stale coffee" create an evocative mood, though the "throughout cooking" timeframe is inconsistently woven into narrative rhythm, diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors ("stitched shadows," "human spirit") elevate the story, but reliance on poetic abstraction occasionally undermines emotional specificity. The theme of community healing is clear but leaves subtextual potential unexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ambiguous futures and symbolic objects avoid overt clichés but occasionally lean on atmospheric vagueness. The "stuffed ear" risks oversimplification, while the news-bulletin device feels conceptually under-exploited, bordering on mechanical plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack interwoven intensity. The brevity amplifies poetic resonance yet limits narrative complexity. The ending achieves closure but lacks lingering philosophical provocation demanded by top-tier standards.</comment>
