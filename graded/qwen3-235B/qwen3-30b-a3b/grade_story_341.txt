<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character transformation signaled but lacks emotional depth; voice remains flat, motivations hinted but not fully explored through actions like the sudden shift from caution to rebellion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc is present but compressed; the rosary-driven events feel logical, yet pivotal moments (fortress becoming a sanctuary) lack payoff due to rushed pacing in the final third.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid but inconsistent sensory details (e.g., "warmth of amber vs. cold stone"); the serpent fortress enhances the theme, but the desertâ€™s symbolic role remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of rosary as a map; the ending resonates thematically but dialogue feels didactic rather than organic, weakening emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by occasional purple prose ("pulsed faintly, as if the desert itself had been pressed into glass") and a predictable revolutionary arc despite fresh imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Holistic cohesion is strained by overreliance on symbolic objects driving the narrative; the theme lingers, but some elements feel checklist-ticked rather than innate.</comment>
