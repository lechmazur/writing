<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (bind old wounds) is present but thinly developed; "trustworthy strange" lacks impact on actions; reactions to elements hint at longing but lack emotional complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed; the catapult activation lacks tactile urgency, and cause-effect between star alignment and time fracture isn't fully visceral within word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (borrowed dawn, lighthouse hum), but setting's internal logic falters—the "line that never moves" is poetic but underexplained; sensory details lean abstract.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (tablecloth as cosmological map) and lyrical prose elevate impact; theme of defiance is consistent, though emotional resonance relies on style over visceral character depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids total clichés but relies on vague, grandiose phrasing ("ghosts still whispered") and occasionally static imagery that feels AI-patterned; originality in combining stars/catapult is undercut by overwrought descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but some feel decorative rather than essential; brevity amplifies poetic tone but limits thematic payoff; achieves mood over narrative complexity.</comment>
