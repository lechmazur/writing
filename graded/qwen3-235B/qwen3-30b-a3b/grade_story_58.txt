<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's loyalty is stated but not consistently demonstrated through actions; motivation shifts abruptly from meditation to radicalizing; journal's influence on decisions lacks depth; voice remains indistinct despite first-person leanings</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Blackout drives plot forward effectively; journal's coded content as catalyst feels plausible; clear arc but rushed conclusion; pacing mostly controlled though some transitions between introspection and action lack fluidity</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Moth observation tower creates potent atmosphere through sensory details (moth-wing rustles, generator hums); blackout enhances tension; symbolic connection between moths' movement and protagonist's rhythm works; journal's physicality underutilized in setting</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Blends surrealism with philosophical undertones to avoid formulaic outcomes; journal's "coded nonsense" approach feels fresh but execution slightly uneven; avoids genre clich√©s though some poetic descriptions border on excessive; emotional resonance emerges through moth synchronicity rather than exposition</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive despite tight constraints; length enhances meditative quality but weakens final act development; premise combines unusual elements creatively; resolution offers intellectual satisfaction but lacks visceral impact</comment>
