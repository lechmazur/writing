<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (escaping “what if”) is clear but lacks deeper emotional grounding; interactions with objects (chalk, clocks) symbolize her struggle, but aloofness remains slightly underdeveloped</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pacing is efficient but slightly rushed; the chalk line’s introduction and vanishing act form a cohesive arc, though transitions between themes feel abrupt in spots</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (smells, visuals) evoke decay and introspection, but blending “space pirate ship” with “cloud paths” creates logical dissonance (atmospheric vs. vacuum environments)</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (chalk as defiance, frozen clocks as regret) and reflective subtext elevate impact; ending resonates emotionally, though explicit “let go” statement slightly undercuts subtlety</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with unique imagery (e.g., chalk as temporal bridge) but contains occasional overwrought phrases (“cartographer of lost chances”); tone and style remain distinctive</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and emotional resonance overall; questionable spatial logic (cloud tracking in space) occasionally disrupts immersion but doesn’t ruin narrative intent</comment>
