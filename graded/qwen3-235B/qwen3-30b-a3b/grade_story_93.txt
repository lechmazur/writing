<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is conceptually clear (sacred geometry, evasion) but underdeveloped emotionally; her backstory and connection to the vanished man lack nuance, making her actions feel plot-driven rather than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses with urgency but feels truncated; corridor revelation is abrupt, undermining cause-effect logic. Sacred geometry’s role in resolution strains credibility, and the word limit sacrifices deeper structural payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (dust, flickering lights) create palpable tension, but the migration archive’s thematic link to sacred geometry and bonds remains superficial. Tone is consistent but underexploits the labyrinth’s symbolic potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pirate radio’s voice adds emotional subtext, but the ending’s “hope” feels imposed rather than earned. Sacred geometry as a “map” is a resonant metaphor, yet its interplay with “unspoken bonds” lacks narrative depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Some phrases (“heart pounding with the weight of what she’d lost”) veer toward cliché, but the labyrinth-geometry-bonds triad is inventive. The “familiar, distorted voice” avoids predictability, though the archive setting leans on genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack thematic synergy; the archive’s shifting walls and calling cards feel like puzzle pieces rather than organic components. The ending aims for poignancy but sacrifices resolution for atmosphere.</comment>
