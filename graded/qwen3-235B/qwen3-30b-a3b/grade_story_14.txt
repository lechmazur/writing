<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually tied to gambling impulse, but lacks psychological depth. "Naivete" manifests only through risky actions rather than internal conflict. Emotional reactions to the candle's success feel abrupt due to underdeveloped interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows recognizable arc from desperation to gamble to consequence, but compressed structure creates forced pacing. Turning point (candle's glow) lacks sufficient build-up. Resolution feels preordained rather than logically earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting functions as active participant through sensory richness - rusted metal, molten wax and salt air create immersive liminality. Atmospheric dread complements thematic tension between human agency and elemental forces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphoric framework (gambling/debt, light/darkness) and haunting imagery elevate craftsmanship. Emotional impact diluted by uneven tone - laughter through tears feels contrived rather than organic. Central conflict between hope and futility remains potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Over-reliance on Gothic tropes (unhinged professors, cursed objects) and rhythmic sentence patterns weaken originality. Some fresh combinations (candle mold as bargaining tool) undermined by formulaic "sea demands balance" moralizing and purple-prose-aspiring descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>ELEMENTS: Candle mold and dock succeed as physical manifestations of thematic core. Professors and timeframe feel like checklist boxes rather than organically integrated components. Conceptual ambition exceeds execution in tight word count.</comment>
