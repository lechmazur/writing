<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (escaping past violence) is clear and tied to actions, but psychological depth feels thin. Dialogue exchanges reveal core conflict but lack nuance—woman's instant thematic exposition undercuts realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows redemption arc but pacing feels compressed. The pivotal museum talisman revelation arrives abruptly, and the woman's sudden shift from hostility to mentorship lacks sufficient psychological groundwork.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Static electricity garden creates mood through crackling sounds/light, but its symbolic function (charged transformation) feels underexplored. Sensory details remain surface-level—no tactile descriptions of electric tingles or ozone smells.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mixed effectiveness. The crate slat as scarified memory object works metaphorically. Ending's "compass"/"chain" contrast feels heavy-handed, but the quietly intense emotional register and tension between silence/voice resonate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes through the charged garden's uniqueness, but redemption arc remains generic. Some telling ("fragile, stubborn hope") and slightly AI-like phrasing ("thread of light in the dark"), though emotional beats avoid pure formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Thematic unity between past scars and future-making works conceptually, but narrative brevity prevents full excavation of possibilities. Leans on "resilience=choice" message without interrogating its complexities.</comment>
