<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's astral nature remains unexplored, reducing it to a label. Compassion drives actions, but lacks psychological depth. The "sometimes always" mantra feels tacked on rather than organically integrated into character consciousness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear flight/rescue trajectory but suffers from compressed logic - key's sentience and child's sudden appearance lack narrative staging. Too many pivotal moments clustered in final paragraphs create rushed resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid decay imagery anchors atmosphere, but carnival's supernatural qualities don't connect to astral elements. Timeframe concept of compressed revelation remains theoretical rather than experiential in prose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sets up compelling thematic duality between survival and compassion, but relies too heavily on stated themes rather than embodied experience. Some striking metaphors (shadow-as-bridge) undercut by abstract closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival tropes clash with underdeveloped astral projection concept. The "tether key" has potential but isn't differentiated from magical object clich√©s. Language veers between purple prose and vague abstractions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than integrate - astral ability remains decorative. Emotional tension diluted by narrator's detached perspective. Brief length exposes structural gaps between conceptual components.</comment>
