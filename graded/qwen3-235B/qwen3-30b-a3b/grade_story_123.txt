<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but lacks depth; "gleefully morose" is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced reactions. Boots are symbolic but under-explored. Actions align with goals but personality remains sketchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but pacing feels uneven—some beats rushed (e.g., terminal discovery), others lingered on. The scuff-as-map concept drives the structure but resolutions feel convenient rather than earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative, visceral atmosphere created through specific details (crunching debris, cold air, cracked terminal). The dying-facility setting and nostalgic tone are masterfully rendered, though temporal shifts between empire transitions could be tighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery (constellation elixir, echoing boots) is striking, but emotional resonance feels curated rather than organic. Themes of rebirth through quiet resilience are clear but undercut by abrupt transitions in tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mixes fresh metaphors ("liquid silver swirling with constellations") with clichéd phrasing ("scars," "flickering light"). Avoids overt tropes but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction that dilutes psychological realism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack organic integration—boots, scuffs, and starlit conversations don't fully intersect. The ending feels thematically satisfying yet leaves unexplored narrative potential within the tight word limit.</comment>
