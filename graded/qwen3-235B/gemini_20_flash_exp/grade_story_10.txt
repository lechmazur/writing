<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but emotional shifts feel rushed; fatal flaw drives plot but internal transformation lacks nuanced progression; traits like 'precisely innovative' remain superficially tied to actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a logical arc but compressed pacing weakens emotional impact; server-room setting initiates character introspection too conveniently; beginning/end connection exists but lacks narrative surprises.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses vivid sensory details (decaying chest, humming servers) effectively; setting evokes isolation but could deepen thematic ties to forgiveness; tone contrasts well with character's internal harshness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance exists via family photos but relies on overt symbolism; ending feels earned yet predictable; theme of forgiveness shows through objects but lacks subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with unique metaphors (elasticizing soul) and mutated recipes; occasional overused phrases ("bitterness consumed him") undercut originality; emotional beats shown through objects more than nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack transcendent integration; brevity works thematically but limits depth; story delivers a satisfying message without groundbreaking execution or lingering ambiguity.</comment>
