<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's "loudly introverted" trait remains abstract, insufficiently shaping concrete actions or decisions; motivation for seeking courage is emotionally resonant but psychologically underdeveloped, reducing existential quest to metaphorical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot achieves structural integrity through cyclical imagery of fading/rekindling light, but meandering action lacks tangible stakes or obstacles; emotional resolution feels earned despite minimal narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Neon cathedral setting is visceral and immersive, with sensory details (eerie light, humming energy, cold air) masterfully constructing post-human melancholia; thick fog and fireflies create haunting visual logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Powerful metaphoric cohesion between damaged CD and fractured courage, but relies heavily on stated emotions; poetic imagery elevates thematic resonance, while overt symbolism occasionally undermines subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Striking atmospheric originality compromised by overadorned sentences ("neon cathedral, its skeletal framework glowing with an eerie, artificial light") and occasionally mechanical repetition; emotional arc feels human but setting approaches cyberpunk trope saturation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic unity between elements creates lingering contemplation about courage's nature, but story's brevity limits deeper exploration; atmospheric brilliance compensates for somewhat skeletal character/narrative construction.</comment>
