<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Presentation of character traits is superficial; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or conflicts; the core trait of "rarely authentic" remains underexplored; character voice lacks distinctiveness despite introspective narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot lacks causal logic and progression; defacement of temple appears disconnected from stated motivations; time compression creates incoherence rather than tension; repetitive circling of themes substitutes for narrative development; cause-effect relationships are arbitrary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Superficial sensory details (humid air, decaying leaves) lack integration with thematic elements; setting functions more as decoration than functional narrative component; inconsistent connection between temple's cultural specificity and protagonist's actions; atmosphere undermines "daring caution" tone by feeling static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on clichéd existential metaphors ("chains", "grid", "jungle");缺乏情感共鸣或智力刺激;缺乏叙事张力或主题深度;结束未解决根本矛盾;修辞重复破坏潜在象征意义;叙事视角未提供独特视角.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>大量重复用语和概念("banish doubt," "unyielding will"); predictably contrasting binaries ("urban grid" vs "chaos");紫色段落密集;情感处理公式化(直接陈述而非具象化);段落结构机械性重复;语气和复杂度变化显示算法痕迹.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>元素拼贴感强烈而非有机整合;写作工艺特征如重复修辞破坏叙事凝聚力;短篇长度未带来形式创新;主题陈述多于探索;无持续性思想交锋或艺术风险.</comment>
