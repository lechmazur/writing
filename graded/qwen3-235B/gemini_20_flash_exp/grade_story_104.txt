<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but inconsistently rendered; "stoic" is contradicted by underdeveloped emotional undertones, and the cameo's symbolism outweighs internal motivation, leaving the steward feeling conceptually constructed rather than psychologically real.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is serviceable but predictable; encoded labels drive minimal action without narrative tension, and the tight word limit sacrifices emotional arc resolution despite technically cohesive bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The miniature world's visual specificity (e.g., "glinting cameo") creates atmospheric intrigue, though underutilized sensory details and disconnected temporal cues (harvest day closure) leave environmental symbolism partially unrealized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic coherence (cracks, conformity, freedom) is undercut by overly explicit thematic signposting; the ending's "quiet rebellion" lacks emotional resonance from surface-level showing that never fully transcends authorial message-fication.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in juxtaposing miniature control with rebellion, but stilted phrases like "symphony of defiance" verge on purple prose; the central method feels logically strained (why shipping labels?) despite subversive novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ideas impress more than execution; the story's concept-driven approach creates intellectual curiosity but struggles with emotional authenticity, and the brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful.</comment>
