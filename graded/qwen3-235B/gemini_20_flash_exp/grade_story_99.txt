<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's casual demeanor is stated but not fully embodied; telekinetic ability serves plot functionally but lacks nuanced integration with personality; motivation for seeking transformation is clear but underexplored thematically</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot unfolds logically through wrapper's memory-triggering mechanism, but flashback transitions feel abrupt; cyclical structure (dilapidated booth returning) works within constraints but resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than organic</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (sunburnt peeling paint, crinkled wrapper) establish haunting atmosphere; carnival decay mirrors theme of lost legends; monastery/marketplace visions provide effective contrast while maintaining cohesive mood</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical treatment of wrapper as knowledge repository creates resonance; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks emotional complexity; subtext about information custodianship is present but thinly rendered</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s by linking telekinesis to ephemeral preservation rather than destruction; flashback integration feels purposeful rather than algorithmic; language maintains specificity without veering into ornate abstraction</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong core concept execution compensates for uneven characterization; elements cohere narratively but thematic depth is occasionally sacrificed to atmospheric flourishes; leaves philosophical questions without overstay</comment>
