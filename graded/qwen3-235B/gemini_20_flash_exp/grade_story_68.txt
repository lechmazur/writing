<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's moral code is clearly tied to actions, but emotional depth and internal conflict remain underexplored, making motivations feel more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression from task initiation to resolution, but pacing feels slightly rushed; some connections between scenes lack emotional payoff despite neat structural symmetry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attempting to merge Roman architecture with steampunk tech creates visual dissonance rather than immersive atmosphere; sensory details are present but unevenly developed across elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolic use of bottle caps and data-recovery-as-justice concept; some emotional beats rely on explicit statements rather than showing; theme of historical memory remains potent yet partially underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing markers but occasionally leans on slightly generic descriptors ("warmth a welcome contrast"); metaphors generally fresh, though "chaotic blend" and similar phrases verge on clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a serviceable narrative but occasionally feel checklist-driven; thematic weight comes through, though tighter integration and deeper exploration could elevate it further.</comment>
