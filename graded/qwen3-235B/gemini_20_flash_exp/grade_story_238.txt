<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character lacks clear motivations beyond vaguely defined light-seeking; abrasive charm is stated but not fully demonstrated through distinct actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Meandering structure without clear narrative progression; atmospheric elements overwhelm underdeveloped plot mechanics despite effective time-limited closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (chipped counter, humid air) create haunting atmosphere; carnival decay complements thematic decay of memory, though some elements remain underexploited.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original concept undermined by occasional purple prose ("storm clouds brewing over forgotten sea") and trope-laden carnival setting; deeper emotional exploration remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric cohesion achieved but narrative necessity questionable; stylistic flourishes occasionally overpower structural integrity within constrained form.</comment>
