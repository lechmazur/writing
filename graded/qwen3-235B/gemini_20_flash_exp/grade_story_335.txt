<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to "make peace with the past" lacks concrete context or emotional depth; "carefully reckless" trait is superficially noted but inconsistently demonstrated through actions that lean passive over paradoxical.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot revolves around static atmosphere over progression, leaving the central quest unresolved; beginning and end disconnected by a meandering middle with no payoff to justify the word count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and symbolic decay of the cathedral amplify the theme, but the setting occasionally overpowers narrative momentum with excessive description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery (amber, cathedral) hints at deeper themes but lacks resolution or subtext; emotional impact diluted by abrupt ending and underdeveloped tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Reliance on brooding tropes (haunted mercenary, mystical relics) and occasionally ornate phrasing undermines originality; avoids AI-like repetition but fails to subvert genre clich√©s.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong atmosphere and concept undermined by flat character execution and plot inertia; elements are stylistically cohesive but narratively underexploited for their thematic potential.</comment>
