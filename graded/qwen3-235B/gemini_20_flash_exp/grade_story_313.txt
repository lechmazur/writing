<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation and remorse conflict are present but underdeveloped; transition from con artist to comforter feels abrupt and insufficiently earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot pivots on a single action (storytelling), but the arc feels compressed; the ghostly interrogation device strains credulity within the tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dystopian farm’s visceral details (rust taste, metal “weeds”) create a haunting atmosphere that deepens the story’s desolation and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges from juxtaposing the con artist’s lies with genuine hope; metaphors (seeds as intangible hope) are effective but occasionally heavy-handed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on AI-adjacent abstraction (e.g., “interrogating ghostly apparitions”); prose sharp but occasionally veers into ornate description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poignant arc; the brevity is purposeful and thematically resonant, though some transitions lack finesse.</comment>
