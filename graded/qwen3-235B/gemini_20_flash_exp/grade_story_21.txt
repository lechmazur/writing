<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character's 'measured diplomat' status is contradicted by vengeful single-mindedness; motivation for revenge lacks psychological nuance despite clear genetic obsession.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Storytelling remains superficially cohesive but elements function as checklists rather than integrated components; brevity feels restrictive, not purposeful.</comment>
