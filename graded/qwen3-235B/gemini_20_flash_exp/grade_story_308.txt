<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's bashfulness and preservation motivation are present but underexplored; internal conflict remains surface-level, while the keychain as a symbol is effective but minimally developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure within constraints, but the executioner’s arc lacks depth; cause-effect ties to the net’s use are logical but could be tighter, and pacing feels slightly rushed during the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (floating studio, tides) but inconsistently layered; sensory details lean heavily on sight, with minimal engagement of other senses to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imagery of captured motion as art elevates the narrative, and the theme of preserving beauty resonates; however, emotional impact is muted by lack of deeper character introspection.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unique premise subverts executioner trope effectively; avoids major clichés but occasionally relies on ornate phrasing that borders on purple prose without detracting significantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively but prioritize concept over depth; brevity works narratively but leaves lingering questions about thematic weight and character authenticity.</comment>
