<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s inner conflict and loyalty are clear, but her shift from duty to self-preservation lacks gradual development; her voice is present but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from observation to transformation, but the arc feels compressed; thematic resolution exists, yet the method (coded routines) is underexplored, creating narrative gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative details (wind, flickering lights) anchor the mood; the moth tower’s atmosphere enhances the protagonist’s isolation, though its symbolic role remains underused.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphor use (storms, flickering lights) and subtext about internal balance elevate the story; emotional resonance deepens through subtle symbolism rather than overt telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise (meditation via street performer’s code) avoids predictability, but some phrasing (e.g., “sanctified dread”) edges toward abstraction without sufficient nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like the journal cover and outage are woven cohesively, though the tower’s role feels peripheral; thematic depth and concise lyricism suggest purposeful brevity.</comment>
