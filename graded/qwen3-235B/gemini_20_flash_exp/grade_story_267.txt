<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation and shallow characterisation; Silas's internal logic is abstract and lacks psychological nuance, while his voice remains indistinct and passive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Predictable arc with vague cause-effect; the transformation plot is underdeveloped, relying on surreal imagery rather than organic progression or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting feels underutilized and disjointed; the "black hole resort" lacks sensory specificity beyond superficial contrasts (manufactured joy vs. shadows).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (unraveling thread, anvil) elevate themes, but emotional resonance is undercut by detached narration and repetitive abstractions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes often overshadow substance; the anvil and "savage bliss" lean on vague symbolism rather than fresh, grounded innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution falters under constraints; elements feel imposed rather than organically integrated, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>
