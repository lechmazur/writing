<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lack nuance; actions align with traits but introspection is overwritten and static. Emotional stakes remain abstract despite elaborate description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but resolution feels abrupt. Storm and confessions drive momentum but structural cohesion suffers from overwritten transitions and uneven pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting provides atmospheric texture but steampunk elements remain superficial. Storm enhances mood, yet details about the observation deck lack functional integration into character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and existential themes (parallel lives, identity) elevate impact. Emotional resonance is undercut by over-reliance on abstract telling rather than embodied tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√© but contains generic phrases ("storm's fury") and inconsistently realized imagery. Writing shows stylistic effort but occasionally veers toward ornamentation over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story remains cohesive despite multiple elements; steampunk and "last code" concepts feel somewhat imposed rather than organically developed. Memorable premise but limited narrative compression.</comment>
