<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is functional but underdeveloped; motivations (nightmares, healing traditions) are clear but inconsistently manifested through actions and introspection. The "spirited" lumberjack trait lacks nuanced grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks traditional structure due to constraints—meandering exploration without concrete resolution. Pacing uneven: rushed internal logic, lingering on atmospheric elements at the expense of plot momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Conceptually rich setting (ossuary-restaurant) underexplored; sensory details sparse. Tonal dissonance between "harsh tenderness" and narrative focus dilutes atmospheric cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some effective metaphoric parallels (ossuary as crucible) but over-reliance on exposition over demonstration weakens impact. Theme of past/future healing emerges but lacks transformative depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but struggles with uneven voice: mixes evocative phrases ("clumsy hands adept") with generic abstractions ("reawakened nightmares"). Occasionally veers into purple prose without sufficient emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially integrated; story feels like checklist fulfillment rather than organic synthesis. Ambitious premise lacks technical execution to justify cohesion or thematic weight.</comment>
