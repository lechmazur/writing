<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's literalness drives her interpretation but lacks deeper behavioral nuance or internal conflict; motivation is clear but surface-level, with limited emotional or psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression via key and notes is coherent but feels streamlined; climax is telegraphed early, limiting narrative surprise, though cause-effect logic holds within tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (e.g., salt decay, ethereal glow) create immersion, but the haunted lighthouse setting and water-war past remain loosely integrated with the protagonist's internal journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery and cosmic revelation evoke wonder, but emotional impact is diluted by exposition; the ending resolves the primary goal but avoids thematic complexity or lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some predictable elements (prodigy protagonist, "key" device) dilute originality, though the fusion of post-apocalyptic setting and cosmic archaeology shows ingenuity; uneven sensory specificity weakens immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion is functional but strainedâ€”elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically woven, though brevity constraints are managed without overt awkwardness.</comment>
