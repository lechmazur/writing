<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lacks depth in character motivations; "quiet mania" is stated but not demonstrated through nuanced behavior or internal conflict. Actions align superficially with traits but fail to reveal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from quest to passage entry, but the roller coaster-key connection feels arbitrary. Pacing is efficient but sacrifices cause-effect clarity; the riddle’s time theme remains superficially resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (rust, wind, decay) evoke mood but lack uniqueness. The roller coaster setting is atmospheric but underutilized thematically; its decay is visual but not tied to the eroding-time concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on generic metaphors ("ink fading with each page turn") to hint at time’s erosion. Ending lacks resolution or subtext; the "riddle of time" is stated but never made visceral or intellectually compelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but defaults to predictable haunted-attraction tropes. Descriptions like "mournful tune" and "beacon in the gloom" border on formulaic; emotional resonance is undermined by heavy exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements are included but loosely connected; the roller coaster and doorknob feel like checklist items rather than organic components. The story ends with narrative inertia, not lingering impact or thematic synthesis.</comment>
