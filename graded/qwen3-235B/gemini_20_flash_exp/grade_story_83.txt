<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (better tomorrow) are stated rather than organically demonstrated through tangible actions; the "suspiciously trusting" attribute creates contradictory behavior without sufficient psychological depth or resolution. The tray-as-divining-rod method feels more plot-convenient than character-shaping.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression follows a linear, foreseeable trajectory through the mirrored maze, but the sudden resolution with the Shadow Beast lacks earned emotional weight or narrative payoff. The wick-tracing method drives the action but feels mechanistically imposed rather than dynamically integrated into pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from visceral details (crackling air, multiplying reflections) and a haunting tone, but the "leaf raking" timeframe serves no functional role. The lab’s decayed grandeur works thematically, though the labyrinth structure prioritizes visual flair over spatial logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses recurring imagery (mirrors, wicks) for thematic resonance but relies heavily on told emotions rather than subtext. The ending’s symbolic gesture of peace feels underdeveloped, diluting its potential impact as a philosophical confrontation between fear and understanding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combines familiar archetypes (abandoned labs, shadow creatures) with a novel method (wick cartography) to avoid pure trope-derivative work. Prose occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction ("mischievous wisdom"), but the metaphor of fragmented selves in mirrors offers conceptual freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story hinges on ambitious concept integration, but execution unevenly balances elements—seasonal setting and "excel" feel arbitrarily applied while the tray/wick method elevates cohesion. Leaves thematic threads dangling rather than resonating with lingering potency.</comment>
