<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Characterization is distinctive and consistent, with social awkwardness manifesting through physical tics and isolation in the diner. Motivation ties tightly to traits but lacks deeper psychological exploration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent setup but lacks traditional progression within word constraints. Time-travel concept through reversed trails creates intrigue but remains underdeveloped, with cause/effect relationships feeling more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eerie diner atmosphere excels through sensory contrasts (coffee hiss vs whistle vibration). Setting/timeframe cohesion achieves near-perfect synthesis, though archive connection feels tenuous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Subtext about redemption through engagement with the past is strong. Ending gains poignancy through restrained showing (trembling finger on map), though emotional payoffs remain more intellectual than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original use of time-travel-as-archaeology avoids genre clich√©s. Occasional purple prose ("build anew") and metaphor density slightly muffle authenticity despite strong voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate with thematic coherence and stylistic cohesion. Story achieves literary resonance through imaginative worldbuilding but sacrifices some narrative momentum in short form.</comment>
