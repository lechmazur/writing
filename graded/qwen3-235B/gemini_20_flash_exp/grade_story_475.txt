<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's detachment is symbolically shown through actions but lacks emotional depth; motivations are hinted at but not fully fleshed out, undermining psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses via repetitive actions but lacks narrative stakes; cause/effect relationships exist but remain shallow within the constrained word limit, resulting in incomplete arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Circus tent atmosphere is visceral but leans on gothic clich√©s; setting details are evocative but inconsistently tied to the character's internal state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphorical themes hint at deeper meaning, but ending feels abrupt; subtext about analog/digital tension is underexplored despite ambitious phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by overused motifs (e.g., "hauntingly bright light"); lullabies and circus setting feel conceptually forced rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imaginative concepts coexist with unfulfilled potential; elements integrate narratively but lack thematic integration to justify all constraints cohesively.</comment>
