<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like reincarnation and "tentatively fierce" lack deep exploration, motivations are somewhat clear but inconsistently realized. The toy soldier connection reveals inner conflict but character depth remains uneven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weather-driven inciting incident propels plot, but pacing and logical gaps (doctor’s chart reference) disrupt flow. Arc exists but feels compressed; cause-effect relationships strain under brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (smells, textures) create atmosphere, but setting lacks connection to character’s psyche. Recipe library feels underutilized as a symbolic space despite initial promise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (soldier, key) carry thematic weight; subtext about tradition vs. change emerges clearly. Ending hints at resolution but lacks emotional payoff. Writing shows skill but avoids risk.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar arcs (redemption via artifact). "Haunting echo" phrasing borders on melodramatic. Tone shifts between whimsy and gravity unevenly sustained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce superficially but lack organic integration. Brief format feels restrictive rather than purposeful; potential for deeper reflection remains untapped.</comment>
