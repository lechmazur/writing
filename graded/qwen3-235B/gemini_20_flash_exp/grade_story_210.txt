<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity; motivations blend into abstract thematic goals. Traits (amiable, doubly singular) inform atmosphere more than behavior. Crossword-solving remains symbolic rather than revealing genuine human response.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Static action works for vignette but lacks narrative progression. Beginning/end connection exists through character's epiphany but feels contrived by tight word limits. Cause-effect logic in timber resonance isn't fully earned emotionally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory cohesion - the haunted lighthouse becomes a living character through creaks, shadows, and wood textures. Atmosphere flawlessly mirrors thematic tension between past/present. Timeframe ambiguity slightly undermines setting integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphor density never feels forced - crossword/grid/ship's bones interlocking brilliantly. Ending carries poetic resolution without neat closure. Subtext regarding historical continuity hums beneath every line. Some "telling" about humility vs showing it.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through material specificity (crosswater clues, vibrating wood), but contains traces of overwritten elegance ("whispers through walls"). Emotional stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Metaphors fresh but occasionally over-explained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained - elements serve theme more than narrative necessity. Word limit embraced as aesthetic choice rather than limitation. Lingering resonance from atmospheric mastery outweighs structural minimalism. Shows craft rather than transcendent innovation.</comment>
