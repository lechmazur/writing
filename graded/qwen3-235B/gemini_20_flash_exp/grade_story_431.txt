<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's introversion and illogically logical mind are mentioned but inconsistently manifested; her identity as a dancer doesn't significantly shape actions or motivations, weakening narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stagnant structure prioritizes mood over plot; lacks clear progression, cause-effect relationships, or resolution despite word constraints, resulting in a static, overly abstract "arc."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shadows, rhythmic needles) and celestial metaphors create a haunting atmosphere; setting complements introspective theme effectively despite underdeveloped context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and lyrical prose elevate emotional resonance, but excessive abstraction and lack of narrative stakes limit deeper impact; ends without earned revelation or closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwrought descriptions and overused metaphors ("storm of thoughts," "pulse of life") verge on purple prose; character psychology feels generalized rather than authentically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmospheric and stylistically ambitious but suffers from narrative inertia; assigned elements coexist more than coalesce, leaving impression without lasting thematic weight.</comment>
