<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Minimal external interaction limits depth; internal motivation to reconcile past/future is present but under-explored. Traits like "dishonestly honest" lack nuanced behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Linear structure functions but strains under brevity; emotional arc is clear but relies heavily on summary over dramatized progression. Symbolic revelation feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Contrasts between sterile clinic and rainforest village establish mood, but village traditions remain vague backdrop. Sensory details (humidity, fluorescent hum) underutilized for deeper atmospheric tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (sheet music, yodel) carry theme effectively, but subtext is thin. Ending achieves thematic closure without emotional surprise; tension remains internalized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar redemptive arcs. Occasional generic descriptors ("gradual revelations") dilute specificity. Language occasionally over-explains rather than trusting imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Elements service theme but lack interconnectivity; detour/clinic framing feels imposed rather than organic. Length restrictions hinder deeper exploration of layered concepts.</comment>
