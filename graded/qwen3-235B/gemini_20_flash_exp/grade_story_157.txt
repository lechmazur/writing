<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like 'elusive puppeteer' are superficially applied without emotional depth; motivations are clear but lack psychological nuance; the ring's use aligns conceptually but feels under-explored as a character-defining tool.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Logical progression from ritual setup to ancestral vision, but pacing drags in middle descriptions; ending resolution feels abrupt despite thematic coherence; cause-effect between rain patterns and supernatural connection lacks organic buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (salt, rain) create immersive atmosphere; setting's isolation contrasts effectively with external tailgating; some inconsistency in how the lighthouse's historical role connects to the ritual mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical use of water/rain imagery; theme of ancestral connection lacks profound subtext; ending achieves closure but feels emotionally muted; tension between absurdity and solemnity is conceptually strong but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; metaphors (dance of water, tapestry of stories) feel fresh; subtle avoidance of purple prose despite ornate descriptions; character psychology remains enigmatic rather than artificially 'humanized.'</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole despite artificial constraints; tailgating subplot and 'specifically universal' attribute strain logic slightly; narrative density prioritizes mystery over clarity but maintains stylistic consistency.</comment>
