<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits motivate action but lack emotional depth; motivations feel imposed rather than naturally emerging from nuanced psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but resolution feels abrupt within word constraints; pivotal action (petrification) occurs without sufficient build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory atmosphere with vivid decay and contrast, but setting connections (pencil box) feel underexploited; tone inconsistent in quieter moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Leverages metaphor and subtext effectively for theme, but dialogue borders on didactic; emotional impact diluted by overly literal exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality in moon-phase curse and truth-as-petrification conceit, but haunted park trope remains unchallenged; occasional overwrought phrasing undermines tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack organic integration; brevity serves plot mechanics more than thematic richness, leaving lingering curiosity rather than profound reflection.</comment>
