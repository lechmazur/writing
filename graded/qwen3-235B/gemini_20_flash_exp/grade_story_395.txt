<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to find manuscripts is clear, but the abrupt shift from duty to rebellion lacks nuanced development. The fortune cookie's role in altering his perspective feels somewhat contrived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot arc from pursuit to alliance is complete but compressed; pacing occasionally falters under the word limit, causing key emotional beats to feel rushed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are functional but unevenly integrated—manuscripts and dance provide cohesion, while forced connections (e.g., music festival reference) and underdeveloped themes limit impact.</comment>
