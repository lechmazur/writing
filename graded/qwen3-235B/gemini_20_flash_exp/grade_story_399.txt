<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear trauma motivation and inner conflict evident, but limited exploration of how "grumpiness" specifically shapes actions beyond surface traits. Transformation feels abrupt despite narrative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear structure with symbolic progression, but resolution feels slightly rushed. Pacing well-managed except for slightly underdeveloped transition between chaos and order. Stargazing motif ties beginning to end effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evoke mystical atmosphere but underutilize sensory potential. The witch's room provides functional setting but lacks distinctive features beyond generic magical tropes. Timeframe connection feels more decorative than integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of mandala as healing process effectively deployed. Some telling ("understood his trauma") undermines subtle imagery. Poetic moments elevate narrative but emotional complexity remains surface-level rather than transformational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elegant prose occasionally borders on redundancy ("restless spirits threatening an uprising within the very fabric of his being"). Fresh metaphors (trauma as "legion of inner demons") but structure follows expected magical healing tropes rather than innovating.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elegant execution of conventional theme. Elements combined competently but not transcendently - story would survive substitutions of "mandala" for "mirror" or "scrying room" for "shrine" with minimal damage to core concept.</comment>
