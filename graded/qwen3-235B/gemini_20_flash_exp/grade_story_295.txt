<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Superficially distinct voice but lacks psychological depth; motivation is logically present yet emotionally thin, relying on inherited tradition rather than organic character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression is clear but lacks narrative stakes; the circular structure (burying/facing doubt) works within constraints, though the transformation feels abrupt without sufficient inner conflict buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (lavender, metallic tang, moonflowers) create immersive atmosphere; the witch’s "elegant mayhem" contrasts effectively with the telescope’s mechanical tradition but occasionally strains believability.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (doubt as weight, transformation as alchemy) resonate, but subtext remains surface-level; the ending’s thematic closure feels under-earned despite poetic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing ("withering vow," "astronomical telescope") borders on purple prose; emotional beats rely on stated feelings ("reluctant," "weight lifted") rather than evocative subtext; avoids major tropes but lacks revelatory reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>6.3</grade>Main elements work in tandem but lack symbiotic urgency; the witch/garden feels peripheral rather than thematically essential; concise execution suggests purposeful brevity but sacrifices nuance.</comment>
