<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent development: knight's weatherbeaten identity lacks specific backstory to anchor motivations. "Grudgingly sweet" emerges abruptly without character voice differentiation. Actions align with redemption arc but lack nuanced reasoning.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coherent progression but rushed resolution. Pattern-to-knocker logic insufficiently explained, weakening plot mechanism. Epiphany feels imposed rather than earned through dramatized events within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere strongly established through sensory details (brine, tarnished objects, lighthouse sounds), but the jagged reef and mirrored confinement remain underutilized as symbolic extensions of the character's psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphorical layering (lighthouse as prison/sanctuary), but emotional arc relies partially on stated feelings rather than fully embodied through concrete actions. Final image resonates thematically.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Combines familiar motifs (haunted knight, lighthouse prison) with moderately inventive pattern-seeking mechanic. Some overwrought phrasing ("mournful song of waves") and formulaic emotional descriptors soften originality impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Element integration mostly cohesive but occasionally contrived. Thematic clarity compensates for minor inconsistencies. Episodic brevity works thematically, though character psychology feels condensed to the point of abstraction.</comment>
