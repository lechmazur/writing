<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's selfless drive is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict; her actions align with her role but motivations feel inherited rather than deeply personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compact structure works within word limits, but the resolution feels abrupt; cause-and-effect in capturing the signal lacks technical specificity to ground the metaphysical elements.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., warped grooves mirroring star-whale songs) immerse readers, but the recycled spaceship’s physicality remains underexplored as a lived space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors and cosmic imagery elevate themes of connection, but emotional resonance wavers due to abstract final lines; "savagery" in grace remains under-embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some phrases (“centuries of longing”) feel performative; tone maintains consistency, but overreliance on alliteration (“savage grace”) risks preciousness without sufficient narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack friction; the story’s brevity feels limiting rather than intentional, with underexplored intersections between legacy and self-sacrifice.</comment>
