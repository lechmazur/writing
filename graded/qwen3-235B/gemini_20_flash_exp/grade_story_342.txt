<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to archive connects weakly to being a "careless pilot"; traits like dreaminess are better integrated. Actions align with his quest but lack psychological depth or complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (entry → deciphering → emancipation), but logic between postcards/labyrinth connection feels contrived. Pacing is efficient but some shifts (e.g., tone shift from resignation to joy) lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive, with vivid sensory details (damp earth, skeletal trees) evoking unease and wonder. Timeframe enhances tension, though its narrative significance remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (doodles as a "language of the earth") and themes of collective memory are layered. Ending resolves emotional conflict satisfyingly, though the small-scale conflict could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some phrases ("swirling nebulae," "skeletal arms") lean on familiar imagery. The postcard-concept feels slightly tropey, and the resolution leans on poetic abstraction over tangible emotional realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly fused; the brevity works thematically but lacks room for deeper character nuance. The theme lingers, but the execution isn’t groundbreaking.</comment>
