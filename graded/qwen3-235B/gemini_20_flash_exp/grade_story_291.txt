<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s daring is surface-level, motivation to confront prejudice remains abstract. Internal conflict underdeveloped despite symbolic gestures like rope. Nuanced voice present but underutilized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot lacks forward momentum; resolution feels abrupt. Cosmic echoes poorly integrated into cause/effect. Pacing stagnates as protagonist meanders. Conceptual underpinning outweighs narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but thinly contextualized. Mirror maze’s grotesque reflections and "calculated wilderness" tone vaguely support theme. Sensory details lavish but disconnected from emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (rope, echoes) present but shallowly handled. Ending’s thematic declaration undercuts subtlety. Conflict resolved through abstract choice rather than narrative tension. Premise lingers but lacks emotional grip.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mirror maze and cosmic echoes verge on cliché. Overwrought phrases ("cosmic echoes of her own making") detract. Emotional resonance derived from exposition, not subtext. Tropes like "spark of defiance" feel rehearsed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist without cohesion. Thematic ambition outpaces execution. Word limit exacerbates structural fragmentation. Stylistic flourishes overshadow clarity, leaving fleeting impression despite high-concept scaffolding.</comment>
