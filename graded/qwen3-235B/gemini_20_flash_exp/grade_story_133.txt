<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (accessing labyrinth) ties to Silas' locksmith identity, but his transformation feels underexplored. Elara's intrigue is palpable but insufficiently grounded. Dialogue reveals surface details about hunting methods but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progression from pottery class to labyrinth works logistically, but the conceptual leap from clay bird to hidden key lacks narrative scaffolding. Pacing mostly controlled despite compressed arc, though the final resolution feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The rooftop labyrinth offers vivid potential, but atmospheric details (e.g., "twisted trees," "colonial town") remain underdeveloped. Sensory engagement is episodic: gloves' texture contrasts with clay's wetness, but these fragments fail to coalesce into a cohesive mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Uses pottery-as-coding metaphor effectively. Dialogue operates on dual levels (craft vs. subtextual secrets), and the key-shaped clay introduces satisfying symbolic tension. Ending introduces thematic questions about preservation, though character interiority remains secondary to atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but employs familiar fantasy scaffolds (mysterious woman, hidden thrones). Voice maintains consistency, though "jaded" descriptors verge on repetition. Some sensory details ("embroidered gloves") feel purposeful, while hunting methods remain abstracted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved through recurring symbols (keys, labyrinths), but thematic ambition exceeds narrative execution. The constrained length amplifies structural weaknesses while underselling emotional stakes. Offers intriguing questions, but lacks definitive resolution or subversion.</comment>
