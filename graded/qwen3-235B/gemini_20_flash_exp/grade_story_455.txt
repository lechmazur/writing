<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character development relies heavily on abstract metaphors rather than concrete actions; motivation to confront ghosts is clear but thinly rationalized through repetitive internal monologue rather than active choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists through shadow-following as a literal and symbolic method, but the tight word limit flattens the arc; emotional resolution feels abrupt without sufficient narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (damp stone, jingling coins) and shadow imagery, harmonizing tone and setting to amplify the character’s internal weight; time frame ambiguity enhances mystique without confusion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyrical prose with layered metaphors (scars as maps, shadows as guides) elevates thematic depth, but overly ornate phrasing occasionally undermines emotional immediacy; ending implies resilience thematically without visceral payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through evocative language, but psychological nuances are hinted at rather than explored—ghosts and scars lean on familiar archetypes; shadow-pattern method feels fresh yet underexplained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but strain under scrutiny—foreign coins and scars serve metaphorical weight while feeling partially superfluous; brevity works against character depth despite deliberate thematic framing.</comment>
