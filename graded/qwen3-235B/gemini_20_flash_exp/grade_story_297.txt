<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is archetypal despite lyrical description; motivations (finding Aethel, reinventing tradition) are clear but lack psychological depth or conflicting desires. Traits like "professionally rebellious" aren't meaningfully tested or evolved in the static narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Preliminary setup dominates without meaningful progression or resolution. The tremor-as-call-to-action lacks narrative momentum within the constraint. Beginning/end coherence exists only as conceptual placeholder for future plot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Volcanic setting merges effectively with sensory details (ozone, hum of cooling systems), creating tangible atmosphere. Slight dissonance between "lava flow" aesthetic and mostly inert coffee shop environment prevents full immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Echoes of forgotten songs metaphor adds thematic resonance; some purple prose ("canvas of swirling ink") distracts. Emotional impact remains surface-level despite poetic effort. Final decision to embrace legacy feels under-earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Relies heavily on mystical artist/lost city tropes without subversion. Flowery descriptors (e.g., "burning desire") and formulaic introspection align with AI-generated patterns. Sensory details occasionally generic despite atmospheric potential.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely interwoven. The brief's constraints overshadow narrative flow. Lingering thematic question about tradition vs. reinvention is promising but underdeveloped. Style occasionally elevates material but often obscures momentum.</comment>
