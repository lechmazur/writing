<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character psychology is thinly sketched; motivations (escape from servitude, "theoretically spontaneous") manifest through vague metaphysical actions rather than concrete behavioral shifts. The sculptor's artistic sensibility is asserted but never demonstrated through tactile details of his craft or tangible interactions with materials.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on fantastical disappearance mechanism that undermines internal logic. The car-washing timeframe creates artificial tension but feels disconnected from the protagonist's existential crisis. Abrupt spatial transition to "infinite possibilities" breaks narrative continuity established in Martian base setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Effective use of Martian dust imagery creates ephemeral beauty against sterile research base. Sensory details about light refraction through glasses convey atmospheric tension. However, the titular "impact crater" remains underexploited as a symbolic landscape—fails to connect geological violence with protagonist's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor of dancing dust as portal works conceptually but executes superficially. Vintage glasses function symbolically as ancestral connection yet lack narrative payoff. Ending presents false resolution—temporary escape feels contrived rather than thematically resonant. Underdeveloped central conflict between artistic impulse and institutional control diminishes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Story exhibits AI writing hallmarks: overreliance on descriptive phrases ("web of intrigue," "murky tenderness") without grounding in lived experience; repetitive dust imagery; sudden metaphysical shifts without narrative foundation; emotionally flattened voice despite first-person-adjacent narration. Overuse of abstract terms ("infinite possibilities") weakens specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements superficially incorporated—car washing, vintage glasses, and disappearance lack causal narrative integration. The 400-word constraint exacerbates episodic structure; brevity exposed rather than elevated. Final line's poetic gesture ("ghost in Martian dust") feels like preordained conclusion rather than earned thematic distillation.</comment>
