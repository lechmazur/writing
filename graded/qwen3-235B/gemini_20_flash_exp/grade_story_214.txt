<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions but lack psychological depth; transformation from grieving trapper to "weaver of light" feels abrupt and underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but compressed; pivotal moments (diagram discovery, energy surge) feel rushed. Resolution lacks narrative weight despite thematic bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective sensory contrasts (metal observatory vs. organic sea glass) anchor atmosphere. "Gritty whimsy" tone inconsistent with somber undertones, weakening emotional cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (black hole doubt, sea glass as hope) elevates theme. Undermined by declarative emotional beats rather than embodied storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</comment>  
</grade><comment>Phrases like "nascent glow" and "symphony of resilience" verge on purple prose. Some elements (shady archives, gritty whimsy) feel prescribed rather than organic. Emotional nuance lost to thematic overstatement.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative functions as intended but lacks narrative ambition. Assigned elements serve plot mechanics over deeper meaning, with thematic resolution feeling teleological rather than earned.</comment>
