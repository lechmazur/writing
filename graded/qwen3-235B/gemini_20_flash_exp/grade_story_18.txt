<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation to find truth aligns with symbolic actions, but emotional depth remains surface-level; telepathy informs passive sensing rather than active engagement with the world.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive and thought-provoking despite tight constraints, though the story leans more on aesthetic juxtaposition than sustained emotional complexity to drive its message.</comment>
