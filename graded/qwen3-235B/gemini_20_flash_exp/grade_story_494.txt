<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character development is undermined by inconsistent execution; arrogance is stated more than shown, and the transformation into humility feels abrupt rather than earned through organic progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure achieves completeness within the word limit, but the pacing stumbles where emotional beats (shackled potential, song's power) are told rather than dramatized, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in specific details (ink scent, distorted shadows) but falters in connecting the calligraphy master's courtyard to the tapestry's lore – the setting feels ornamental rather than integral to the magic system.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in the tapestry's reanimation mirrors character growth; ending resonates thematically, though explicit declarations ("ready to face the world") dilute emotional subtlety. Central conflict of internal struggle is clear but undercomplicated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy tropes (magic tapestries, transformative songs) without distinctive reinvention. Phrases like "harsh tenderness" and "shackled potential" lean into conceptual shorthand rather than exploring nuanced emotional states or magical logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration is functional but not exceptional – the courtyard and song serve more as symbolic stages than living components. Some creative combinations (wedding song unlocking power) emerge, but the brief feels more shaped by constraints than deliberate artistic choice.</comment>
