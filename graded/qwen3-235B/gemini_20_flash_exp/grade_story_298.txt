<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's rational impulsiveness isn't fully demonstrated through actions; motivation is stated rather than shown through concrete emotional unraveling; the chameleon aspect lacks behavioral specificity beyond generic "becoming" roles; the connection between cold-case solving and performance remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Reproduction of the servant's story serves as a weak narrative driver; plot lacks clear progression from beginning to emotionally resonant climax; atmospheric buildup dominates over cause-effect sequences; the tattered dress's symbolic role overshadows its practical function in advancing action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective integration of post-oil decay with palace's physical state; the tattered dress and fractured sunlight create strong visual motifs; sensory details (dust, fabric texture, shifting shadows) immerse but occasionally overwrite; tone of anxious serenity is atmospherically consistent but underexplored structurally.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Poetic imagery elevates atmosphere but sometimes substitutes for meaningful action; emotional honesty theme remains abstract rather than emerging organically; underutilized dramatic potential in merging performance with cold-case recreation; ending feels more like artistic meditation than narrative resolution despite strong symbolic undercurrents.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on melancholic abstractions ("fractured sunlight," "echo of absence"); repetitive explorations of vague "emotional truth"; overly formal diction occasionally distances reader; character psychology relies more on stated paradoxes than nuanced internal logic; atmosphere feels more hand-crafted than organically emerging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elements feel checklist-driven rather than organically interwoven; historical setting and oil-extraction collapse add atmospheric weight but drive little internal narrative logic; core concept of emotional reproduction provides thematic glue but lacks technical specificity; writing shows stylistic ambition but uneven execution.</comment>
