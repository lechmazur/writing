<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character aloofness is evident but motivations lack nuanced exploration; emotional contradictions (e.g., eagerness/resignation) feel underdeveloped; past connections remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure, prioritizing introspection over action; emotional arc exists but coherence suffers from compressed philosophical musings replacing concrete developments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Futuristic mall establishes contrast through sensory details, but settings function more as backdrop than active narrative forces; relic's ties to environment feel superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (tile as map, memory as landscape) work conceptually but execution leans on familiar tropes; emotional resonance undercut by heavy-handed symbolic explanations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stylistically polished but bordering on precious prose; conceptual framework feels deliberately constructed rather than organically emergent; subtext occasionally explicit rather than subtle.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements combine technically well but lack inventive recontextualization; story remains within expected thematic boundaries without transcendent insights or structural innovation.</comment>
