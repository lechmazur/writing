<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's fading glory is established but disconnected from his origami-driven intellectual pursuit; motivation lacks psychological depth, and methods feel arbitrarily mystical rather than organically tied to champion persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Static plot structure with no narrative progression—folding and refolding same origami object creates circular stagnation; fragmented imagery fails to cohere into meaningful arc or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Island atmosphere offers evocative details (whispering winds, churning sea), but setting remains decorative rather than integral; fails to manifest "comforting disturbance" as lived experience versus stated concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ambitious metaphors (origami as consciousness map) create intellectual allure, but obfuscate emotional engagement; ending repeats opening motifs without earning transformative insight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on overwrought poeticism ("fathomless gaze," "realistically imaginary") bordering on self-parody; repetitive descriptors and vague abstractions suggest AI-generated impressionism without authentic vision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Element integration feels contrived—each assigned component acts as checklist item rather than organic storytelling device; attempts profundity through collage rather than narrative cohesion.</comment>
