<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (seeking escape from petty theft cycle) ties to actions, but psychological transformation feels accelerated without deeper exploration of internal conflict or nuanced reactions to the dummy's presence. Voice emerges but lacks individuality beyond poetic diction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows clear arc of transformation through poetry sessions, but pacing compresses emotional beats (e.g., dummy's role as catalyst isn't fully interrogated). Logical progression exists but risks feeling schematic due to word limit constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lighthouse's rust/brine atmosphere and eerie dummy create immersive, symbolic setting. Sensory details (ghostly hum, painted eyes) enhance tension and thematic contrast between decay and creation. Dummy's connection to the transformation feels organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (poetry as sustenance) and symbolism (dummy as silent witness) add depth. Theme of artistic rebirth through spoken word is coherent but lacks subtextual richness. Ending resolves neatly but doesn't linger emotionally or intellectually beyond narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh premise avoids most clich√©s, though "haunted lighthouse" and "pickpocket redemption" risk familiarity. Sensory details specific (brine/rust) but occasional overwrought phrases ("scorching poise"). Shows authorial voice but could push further into disquieting abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive whole: dummy and setting amplify character arc, poetry method serves theme. Length feels deliberate, balancing brevity with emotional resonance. Leaves contemplative aftertaste without overexplaining.</comment>
