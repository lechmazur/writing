<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character’s “indifference” is inconsistently portrayed; the covenant motivation is asserted but not deeply explored through actions or internal conflict. His mystic simplicity lacks nuance in shaping decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels compressed; the ritual’s symbolic resolution is abrupt. The “collection of objects” method drives action but lacks mechanical originality. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive through tactile details (stone, dust, silence), but the cathedral connection feels superficial. Sensory elements excel, though the “between bells” timeframe is underexploited thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective use of objects as symbols (resilience, fragility). Ending resonates faintly but lacks emotional weight. Themes of renewal and covenant are hinted at but leave room for deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some lyrical prose elevates tone, but sporadic abstract phrases (“whispers of the stone”) border on cliché. The story avoids AI-writing markers but leans on familiar ritual motifs without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but occasionally feel checklist-driven. The brevity works for mystery but risks underdeveloped stakes. Conceptual threads (covenant, rubble) are suggestive but not fully interwoven.</comment>
