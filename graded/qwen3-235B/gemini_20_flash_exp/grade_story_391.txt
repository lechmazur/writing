<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional exploration to fully justify the protagonist's obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot shows a loose arc but feels truncated; cause/effect links between discoveries lack development. Pacing stumbles in balancing exposition with action due to tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a haunting underwater decay atmosphere, but the coral reef city’s logic (physics of submerged architecture, ecosystem coherence) remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance between driftwood carvings and collective consciousness; ending creates lingering thematic weight. Lute melodies as questions are underutilized as recurring motifs.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in using driftwood as a consciousness map; avoids most underwater dystopia tropes. Some overly poetic prose (“surging ideals,” “quiet revolution”) borders on cliché without deeper contextualization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements like the apron and piano are cohesively tied to themes but occasionally feel schematic. The story’s brevity serves the “awakening” concept but sacrifices depth in secondary worldbuilding.</comment>
