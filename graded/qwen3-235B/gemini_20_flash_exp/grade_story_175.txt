<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character lacks nuanced development despite symbolic motivations; dialogue reveals thematic intent but feels more archetypal than deeply human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear structure with beginning/middle/end, but resolution feels abrupt; pacing within constraints works though some narrative threads remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (bioluminescent fungi, tarnished cage) create immersive atmosphere; setting enhances tone but underutilizes mushroom village's potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (birdcage decay=tradition decay) are powerful; subtext about confronting truth lingers, though emotional resonance occasionally relies on abstraction over visceral impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI clich√©s with fresh imagery (feral elegance), but some phrasing ("whisper secrets") risks formulaic symbolism; tone remains consistent despite tightrope between poetic and overwritten.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but feel occasionally checklist-driven; brevity works thematically yet leaves character and world textures underdeveloped.</comment>
