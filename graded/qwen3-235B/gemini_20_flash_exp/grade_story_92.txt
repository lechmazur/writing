<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Characters possess surface-level quirks but lack psychological depth; Finn’s motivation as a sanctuary-seeking caretaker is hinted but underdeveloped, while the woman’s fear feels unrooted. Relationships (e.g., Ms. Abernathy) are implied but not substantiated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Establishes mood-driven tension but falters in resolution. The inciting incident (the woman’s presence) disrupts the established order but lacks a clear narrative payoff. Pacing uneven—lingers on atmosphere at the expense of advancing plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Haunting visual motifs (bruised purple light, "predatory" flora) create visceral atmosphere. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally over-saturated, bordering on Gothic cliché. Timeframe enhances the uncanny mood but isn’t thematically integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and tension sustain engagement, though emotional impact is diluted by unresolved conflicts. The botanical collection’s predatory duality offers subtle metaphor, but the ending’s "protector" pivot feels abrupt, undermining thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mix of original and familiar elements: haunted mansion/carnivorous plants subvert slightly, but the blood drive backstory and silent agreement lean on contrivance. Avoids overt clichés but employs predictable emotional beats (e.g., tremulous fear). Language occasionally veers into ornamental excess (e.g., "loud silence").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack alchemy. The mansion and plants anchor the story, while weaker links (blood drive, silent agreement) destabilize logic. Strong imagery lingers, but structural gaps (undeveloped characters, abrupt tonal shifts) hinder memorability.</comment>
