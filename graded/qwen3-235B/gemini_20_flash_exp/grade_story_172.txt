<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Weak character motivation coherence; "unsettled" and "accidentally heroic" traits inconsistently manifested through surface-level actions. Psychological depth sacrificed for plot mechanisms like the puzzle box.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rushed pacing undermines narrative cohesion; prophecy resolution feels artificially abrupt despite clear beginning/middle. Assigned action of "align" via reversed wishes lacks logical internal rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid but uneven sensory details create atmospheric peaks (seashell's glow) and valleys ("deserted beach" genericism). Setting-to-concept integration intermittently strong but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("sharp gentleness") contrast with didactic theme presentation. Ending achieves bittersweetness through concrete image of pearl but lacks layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Mixes clich√©d tropes ("prophecy") with fresh concepts (reverse wishing). Purple prose tendencies ("architectural secrets resonating with reversed wishes") undermine otherwise inventive core.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements inconsistently interwoven; some (pearl) integral, others ("last photo") extraneous. Premature ending suggests conceptual ambition exceeding execution within constraints.</comment>
