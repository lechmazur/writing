<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing attribute and motivation, but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict; reactions feel disconnected from the premise's philosophical potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coherent but shapeless - the assigned elements are strung together without meaningful progression toward a resolution or revelation, creating a technical exercise rather than a story.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting contains promising contrasts (block parties vs. silence) but delivers atmospheric clich√©s rather than original sensory texture that could make the world feel lived-in and urgent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses technology/earth metaphors skillfully, but the ending's lack of pay-off and shallow emotional engagement prevent full thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by overly familiar "sentient code seeking truth" trope; avoids formulaic phrasing but sometimes substitutes strangeness for substance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stylistic competence can't mask the structural emptiness beneath clever concepts; reads as a promising outline masquerading as a finished story.</comment>
