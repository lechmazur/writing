<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's unique trait ("figuratively literal") is consistently applied, but lacks depth in how this drives their core motivations or internal conflicts; reactions to objects are cerebral but disconnected from psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Narrative flow is disrupted by overly abstract descriptions substituting for plot progression; climactic moment lacks emotional payoff, creating an unfinished sensation despite the constrained length.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The setting's cultural specificity is underutilized, functioning more as exotic backdrop than integrated atmosphere; sensory details are unevenly distributed, with sound (echoes) overemphasized while tactile elements remain undeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The butterfly-as-prophecy metaphor shows promise but lacks narrative weight; atmospheric tension and poetic imagery engage intellectually but struggle to generate visceral emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptually inventive but occasionally succumbs to self-conscious lyricism; some phrases strain for profundity without earned emotional gravity, while the core premise remains refreshingly unconventional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story successfully unites assigned elements in theory but struggles to make them narratively compelling; the premise lingers in conceptual realms rather than building tangible narrative momentum or thematic revelation.</comment>
