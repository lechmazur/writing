<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation connects to the curse breaking, but lacks depth in exploring personal stakes. Actions align with traits, but inner conflict feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The plot forms a complete arc within constraints, but backstory integration feels rushed. Cause/effect between acts of kindness and curse-breaking lacks narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong sensory details create atmosphere, but magnetic anomalyâ€™s purpose remains murky. Setting enhances mood but unevenly interacts with plot mechanics.</comment>
