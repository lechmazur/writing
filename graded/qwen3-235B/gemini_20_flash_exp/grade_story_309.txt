<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Corbin’s exhaustion and sarcasm shape his actions, but motivations could be more organically tied to his past cases; his inner conflict is clear but slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rapid transition from investigation to introspection is logical, but the tight word count slightly undermines the clarity of cause-effect in memory sequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vanishing Point Gallery’s decaying vibrancy and the eerie silence create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details (shattered glass, kaleidoscope’s swirl) immerse readers, though sound and touch could be deeper.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope as a metaphor for fragmented memory is poignant; subtext about confronting the past adds depth. Ending lacks a decisive arc but feels purposeful for the tone.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés by linking the detective’s psyche to the surreal method; descriptive language is vivid without feeling forced. Some phrases (“molten sarcasm”) risk pretension but serve character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified narrative; brevity enhances the story’s poetic introspection. Leaves a lingering question about whether memories empower or destroy Corbin.</comment>
