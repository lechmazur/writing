<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character defined by traits but lacks nuanced emotional depth; motivation is clear but reactions feel underdeveloped; object (pen) connects to skill but not guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Skirmish underdeveloped as a driver; ledger restoration forms a clean arc but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect between conflict and protagonist’s goal remains implied, not organic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends evocative sensory details (wind, turbines) but setting feels inconsistent; turbines’ purpose and connection to ancient temple lack logical integration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Vocabulary occasionally veers into cliché (“warm, living story”); some phrases (“resigned exuberance”) feel stated rather than dramatized; atmospheric elements border on ornamental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in structure but strained; elements (turbines, skirmish) feel imposed rather than organic; brevity works thematically but limits narrative complexity.</comment>
