<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character traits (thin lips, formal casualness) superficially sketched but not deeply integrated into motivations or actions; ambition to "gorge on knowledge" is clear but lacks psychological nuance. Reactions to the artifact reinforce obsession rather than reveal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight rise-to-catastrophe structure, but pacing stalls slightly in dense exposition; cause-effect between textbook research and artifact activation is logical, though the climax leans on vague "power" tropes. Ends with implied doom, but arc resolution feels truncated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting excels with claustrophobic decay (dust motes, mildew) and visceral imagery (glowing fragment); the abandoned mine/library hybrid creates a sense of isolation. "Confusing certainty" tone is evoked via eerie light and pulsing atmosphere, though time frame (final calendar page) barely impacts the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in sensory detail but leans on familiar "hubris-unleashes-evil" arcs; some phrases ("forgotten magic," "manic muttering") border on formulaic. Writing is precise but lacks distinctive stylistic flourishes; the ending avoids predictability but doesn’t fully subvert genre expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a central theme of dangerous knowledge, though "formally casual" and the calendar detail feel extraneous. The short form highlights tension but sacrifices deeper exploration. Leaves an impression of looming consequences, if not profound resonance.</comment>
