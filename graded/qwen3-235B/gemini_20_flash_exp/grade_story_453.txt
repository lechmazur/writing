<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth or internal conflict; motivation is consistent but one-dimensional. The "foolhardy" aspect feels underexplored despite obsessive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic arc but feels compressed; the symbolic shift from winter to growth lacks nuanced cause-and-effect progression within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Miniature world evokes visual imagery but underutilizes sensory detail. The detached tone creates emotional distance, weakening atmospheric immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (cup lid as sun, snow globe as universe) are evident but underdeveloped. Ending lacks emotional payoff or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Original premise but relies on familiar archetypes (obsessed scientist, miniature worlds). Some sensory details feel generic, and the "confessional tapes" device seems contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>ELEMENTS ARE INTEGRATED BUT FEEL MECHANICAL; THE SNOW GLOBE AND CUP LID DRIVE THE STORY, WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS (E.G., "STAR GAZING") FEEL TANGENTIAL.</comment>
