<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has psychological depth but motivation wavers between philosophical resignation and active leadership; connection between cartography and leadership lacks full integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure sacrifices some momentum for thematic resonance; cause-effect within the limited arc remains logical but feels slightly static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Oppressive solar panels vs. fragile orchard creates compelling sensory contrast; atmosphere perfectly reflects bittersweet tension but slightly over-explains the symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (maps/pruning/language-as-guidance) resonate; ending loops elegantly but lacks pronounced emotional payoff due to restrained prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s entirely; all elements (solar panels, coded disclaimers, cartography) subvert genre expectations without feeling contrived or self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a singular thematic vision; shorter length amplifies the meditation on subtle influence over overt control; could benefit from more tangible conflict.</comment>
