<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear motivation to marry logic and madness, but character remains more symbolic than fully developed. The 'dazed' trait isn't deeply integrated into his actions beyond vague detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Structured around static actions without significant progression. The word limit results in a vignette-like quality; the beginning and end mirror each other without meaningful evolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Immersion comes from isolated sensory details (e.g., "damp earth") but lacks cohesive integration of the sound garden's unique potential as a setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Relies heavily on abstraction to convey theme. Metaphors like "chalk as a weapon" resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original in premise but hampered by occasional cliched phrases ("cosmic dance") and borderline purple prose in atmospheric descriptions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Incorporates required elements cohesively but lacks narrative urgency. The brevity serves thematic focus while sacrificing emotional depth or plot complexity.</comment>
