<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's strangeness and rebellion are vivid but underdeveloped; motivations feel somewhat external rather than organically tied to his merchant background. The butter churn lacks deep symbolic connection to his persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot's symbolic ascent lacks clear cause/effect progression; the abrupt climb-to-truth resolution feels disconnected from earlier atmospheric setup. Pacing compresses arc too tightly, sacrificing narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stark contrasts between sterile space station and lost Earth create strong atmosphere. Sensory details mostly limited to visual metaphors; deeper immersion through tactile/smell elements missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (churn, peeling poster) and thematic resonance about manufactured reality. Ending feels philosophically weighty but emotionally unspecific; loses impact in abstract final lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Element integration feels concept-driven rather than organic; the butter churn and poster method strain credulity. Writing style leans into occasional purple prose, undermining emotional authenticity.</comment>
