<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Lacks depth beyond surface traits; motivations are clear but underdeveloped. Actions align with goals but reveal little about Silas' internal complexity beyond the established "trustworthy" angle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Basic three-act structure exists but lacks tension or meaningful progression within the word limit. Plot hinges on a single mystical event rather than active problem-solving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Underwater multiverse setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details that enhance the tone. The submerged decay provides effective atmosphere but feels underutilized narratively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Imagery of maps as stories succeeds. The ending delivers thematic resonance about human connections transcending commerce. Subtlety in showing rather than telling is strong, particularly with the phantom hand's emotional echoes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally overdoes "bittersweet" descriptors. The multiverse concept leans on tropes without substantial innovation, though the grafting metaphor offers fresh perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but lack transformative execution. The brief format works effectively for atmospheric moments but struggles to develop character or concept fully within constraints.</comment>
