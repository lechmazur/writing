<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (escape through stamps) is clear but underdeveloped; transformation from sullen farmer to determined visionary lacks psychological depth or nuanced internal conflict despite symbolic use of objects.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean arc from resignation to transformation, but compressed pacing strains plausibility. The quilt's creation feels rushed, with cause-effect between inspiration and action relying heavily on thematic abstraction rather than organic progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements (murky light, industrial decay) create visual texture but underwater setting remains underutilized. The environment doesn't meaningfully interact with character actions or thematic concept beyond symbolic window dressing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric scaffolding (stamps as portalways, quilt as liminal space) elevates the narrative. Emotional resonance remains surface-level, however, with epiphany feeling more narratively enforced than earned through character-specific details.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in stamp-quilt interplay is undercut by familiar "magic object" tropes. Language remains mostly purposeful but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction (e.g., "fluid boundaries") without sufficient grounding in Silas' concrete perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements function thematically but unevenly. The underwater setting feels arbitrarily chosen compared to more organic alternatives; stamp/quilt connection provides cohesion core. The brevity serves the transformation theme but restricts emotional investment.</comment>
