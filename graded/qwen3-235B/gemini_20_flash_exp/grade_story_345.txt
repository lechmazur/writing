<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thomas's existential crisis as a lapsed priest is philosophically rich but lacks concrete backstory anchoring his motivations. His confusion drives the narrative but lacks tangible reactions beyond introspective monologue. The abacus symbolizes his fractured faith but isn't deeply tied to his priest persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Vague internal struggle substitutes for plot. Snow patterns and jogging lack narrative propulsion, causing static pacing. Themes of defiance against fate loop without progression, offering no clear arc or resolution within the word limit. Cause-effect between setting and action feels arbitrary.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Surreal imagery (bean stalks as cathedrals, whispering leaves) creates atmosphere but fails to integrate thematically. The "dull radiance" tone is inconsistently maintained, with brightening skies undercutting the oppressive mood. Sensory details are vivid but disjointed from character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (abacus → lost choices/fait) are effective but underdeveloped. Themes of self-reclamation resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction. The hopeful ending attempts transcendence but lacks earned payoff. Literary devices are competently used but not innovative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Original setting elements (giant bean stalks) contrast with clichéd phrases ("tapestry unraveling," "leaf in the wind"). The priest/abacus combo avoids tropes but leans on overfamiliar rebellion-against-fate rhetoric. Sensory detail specificity is inconsistent, leaning toward poetic abstraction over immersive concreteness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>All elements cohesively orbit themes of self-determination but strain under the word limit. The abacus and labyrinth setting form a symbolic backbone, yet narrative feels cramped rather than elliptical. The ending's hopeful flicker suggests ambition but lacks transformative weight.</comment>
