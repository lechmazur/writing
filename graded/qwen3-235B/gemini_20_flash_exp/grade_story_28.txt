<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Absent internal conflict or distinct voice for Finch; Elara's shallow motivation. Actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Predictable arc; rushed climax feels unearned. Cause-effect logic holds but lacks tension. Pacing uneven—slow exposition, sudden resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid decay in carnival descriptions, but insufficient sensory layering. Atmosphere complements theme but lacks haunting specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weak emotional resonance; subtext about cultural mortality underdeveloped. Fork symbolism works, but clichéd "guardian of heritage" framing dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unconventional premise undermined by over-literary prose. Occasional fresh metaphors compete with generic descriptors. Tropes like "frail elderly keeper of lore" lack subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements exist in uneasy coexistence—carnival setting and "volunteering" tradition particularly dissonant. Memorable symbols undercut by shallow thematic exploration.</comment>
