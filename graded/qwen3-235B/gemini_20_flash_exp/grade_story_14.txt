<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits (naivety, unpredictability) emerge through obsessive candle-making and lectures, but motivation remains abstract. Actions align with desperation but lack psychological depth; voice feels filtered through dense prose rather than distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Vague "capture spark before oblivion" arc exists but lacks concrete cause-effect. Pacing stalls in middling descriptions of turbines and wax; abrupt shifts between abstract yearning and tangible candle feel unresolved within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Contrasting industrial power station with candlelit dinners creates tension, but sensory details (metal, wax) repeat without deeper symbolic layers. The tide-connected lights are underutilized atmospheric elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Candle-as-metaphor cycles through obvious tropes (hope, darkness). Ending's "peace" lacks earned emotional weight. Tension between technology/mysticism hinted but remains conceptually flat; themes never transcend surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwrought phrases ("hulking metal beast," "raw, untamed power") border on purple prose. Bargains-with-nature trope recycled without subversion. Character logic leans on "gambleness" clich√©s rather than individualized logic. Sensory details generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function decoratively rather than synergistically. Length exposes shallow thematic excavation. Residual impression comes from atmospheric fragments rather than narrative cohesion or insight.</comment>
