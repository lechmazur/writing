<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but lacks psychological depth; "aggressively kind" is asserted rather than demonstrated, and the first-person voice remains abstract, serving themes over human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from metaphorical abstraction overshadowing narrative logic; the sequence of actions relies on thematic symbolism over cause-and-effect, with an ending that feels conceptually closed but emotionally unresolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create atmospheric immersion, but some connections (plastic whistle in haunted lighthouse) strain believability; the setting enhances mood more than it drives narrative or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphor elevate thematic resonance, but emotional impact is diluted by excessive abstraction; the central conflict remains metaphysical rather than visceral, limiting lasting impression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Originality is undercut by reliance on romanticized tropes (whale songs as ancient wisdom, haunted lighthouses); some device-driven storytelling and poetic excesses border on purple prose without sufficient subtextual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ideas outweigh execution; cohesive in concept but uneven in element integration, with several components (dancerâ€™s timing, whale connection) feeling imposed rather than organically developed within the constrained format.</comment>
