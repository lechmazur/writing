<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; traits like theoretical rebellion align with actions but remain abstract rather than being demonstrated through nuanced internal conflict or external interaction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks dynamic progression; the cyclical ritual undermines forward momentum. While the beginning-end connection exists thematically (barrenness to tentative life), the minimalist arc feels underdeveloped within word constraints despite clear cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visually arresting setting with comet/orchard duality effectively mirrors character's psychological terrain. Sensory details like skeletal trees and brittle album pages create immersive atmosphere that deepens thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyrical prose employs effective metaphors (flowers as "testaments") but occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction ("language of the earth"). Ending's thematic payoff is emotionally muted despite skillful thematic unification about quiet rebellion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by clich√©d refrains ("quiet defiance," "deliberate wilderness") and overly poetic exposition. Some elements risk becoming aestheticized symbols rather than organic components, bordering on algorithmic pattern repetition in descriptive passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coalesces around its thematic core but occasionally prioritizes lyrical abstraction over narrative specificity. The brevity feels purposeful but sacrifices certain layers, leaving some elements suggestively half-formed rather than fully resonant.</comment>
