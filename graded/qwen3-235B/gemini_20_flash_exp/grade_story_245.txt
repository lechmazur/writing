<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character has distinct traits and voice, but motivation shifts feel underdeveloped; the chopstick's significance is hinted at but not fully explored, leaving his inner conflict only partially realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains cohesion within constraints, though the leap from tea leaves to docking bay lacks sufficient causal scaffolding; ending feels purposeful but slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative with durasteel, pre-dawn chill, and tea rituals, but integrates setting and sensory details inconsistently; spaceport's potential as a symbolic map remains underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) deepen themes; ending resonates with introspective growth, though the central conflict's scale feels diminished by the abrupt resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar motifs (fortune-telling tea leaves); writing style is fluid yet occasionally leans on overly poetic phrasing without undermining originality entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like the chopstick and tea leaves feel organically woven into the narrative; the story's brevity amplifies its thematic focus, though some tonal shifts destabilize cohesion.</comment>
