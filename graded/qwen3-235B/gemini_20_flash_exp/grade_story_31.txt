<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (finding sister) is clear but lacks depth; "endearingly irritating" aspect of possessiveness isn't sufficiently explored beyond brief mention.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compressed scope; sudden shift to digital mapping lacks visceral engagement; "x-out" action drives conclusion but feels rushed within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Neo-Kyoto's cyberpunk atmosphere is visually established but underutilized; garden's sensory details (jasmine, neon) enhance mood but fail to fully integrate with protagonist's emotional state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emotional impact is surface-level; reliance on clich√©d metaphors ("digital darkness," "beacon of hope") dilutes deeper themes; character voice lacks distinction despite first-person narrative potential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("disconnected world," "hidden potential") and predictable cyberpunk-family tropes suggest formulaic thinking; sensory details border on generic, with insufficient subversion of expected motifs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story struggles with tonal consistency; forced juxtaposition of agrarian and cyberpunk elements; central theme of connection remains underexplored despite structural coherence.</comment>
