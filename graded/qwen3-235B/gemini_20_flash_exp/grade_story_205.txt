<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tidy arc but feels compressed; method of hiding the seaweed is logical but lacks tension; resolution is abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ethereal swamp atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory details, but its symbolic weight leans overly on clichéd fireflies as metaphors for hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through subtle symbolism (e.g., corroded cameo holding laughter), but the ending’s thematic exposition undermines subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality wavers between fresh metaphors (“peaceful frenzy”) and formulaic descriptors (“delicate warrior”); some overly ornate phrasing distracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements are competently fused, but the story reads as a polished vignette rather than a profound statement; tone and structure feel slightly contrived.</comment>
