<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks active motivation; "humbly arrogant" trait feels contradictory and underdemonstrated. Psychological depth is minimal, with traits stated rather than shown through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot exists on a single emotional note without variation. The awakening of the globe lacks mechanical logic, and the arc remains static rather than transformative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere works best with tactile details (cold brass, crashing waves) but relies too heavily on stock descriptors ("hush," "forgotten"). Lighthouse setting's symbolic potential is underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong imagery and cosmic metaphor elevate the poetic quality, but the ending's revelation feels predetermined rather than earned, reducing emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh metaphors ("bridge between worlds") and clich√©d phrases ("whisper secrets," "echo of a voice"). The narrative avoids overt tropes but occasionally indulges in overwrought prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist without deep integration; atmosphere strongest component. The concise form feels limiting rather than deliberate, with thematic weight unevenly distributed.</comment>
