<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; "lost heiress" label isn't meaningfully connected to actions or psychology. Motivation stated but not convincingly dramatized. Actions feel abstract rather than personally driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot exists as a series of static, poetic moments rather than dramatized action. The unification attempt lacks stakes or conflict. Pacing even but stagnant, with artificial "resolution."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through bioluminescence/cloud imagery, but worldbuilding remains superficial. The xenobiology setting isn't meaningfully integrated with the conceptual stakes of fragmentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes overwhelm emotional impact. The theme of fractured reality has surface appeal but lacks subtext. Ending feels hollow despite poetic language. Conflict is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on sci-fi tropes (fractured realities, xenobiology) without reinvention. Overly ornate prose ("living brushstrokes") often substitutes for substance. Emotional register remains distant and abstracted.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements mechanically included but not organically integrated. The story reads as a checklist fulfillment rather than cohesive artistic vision. Conceptual ambition outpaces execution.</comment>
