<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced reactions or choices. Actions align with traits but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pacing condenses plot into tight space but creates disjointed cause-effect relationships; ending feels abrupt rather than earned, weakening narrative coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contrast between high-tech center and piano bench creates tension, but sensory details oversaturate rather than immerse; atmospheric elements aren't tightly linked to theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (piano keys as potentials) and subtext about predictability vs. creativity show promise, but ideas overshadow emotional resonance; ending lacks lingering impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose occasionally lapses into abstract phrasing ("quiet rebellion," "vibrant symphony") that feels rehearsed; avoids genre clich√©s but leans on ornate descriptors rather than immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't interlock seamlessly; some choices (piano decoding) strain credulity; style occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity; concept lingers more than execution.</comment>
