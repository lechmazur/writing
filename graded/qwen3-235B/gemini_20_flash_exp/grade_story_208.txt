<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's melancholic duality and quest for meaning are evocative but motivations occasionally border on abstract vagueness; the pen-as-metaphor is compelling but the cosmic absurdity angle lacks sufficient behavioral grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot's metaphysical yearning is poetic but narrative progression remains diffuse; the rewind concept drives symbolism effectively but lacks tangible stakes or cause-effect logic within the compressed structure.</comment>
