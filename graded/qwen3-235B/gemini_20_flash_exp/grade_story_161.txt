<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like vigilance and sardonic glee are present but underdeveloped; motivations are clear but connections between his profession (orchardist) and key actions/symbols feel forced. Emotional depth is stated rather than shown through nuanced behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plotted with clear beginning/middle/end, but pivotal transitions (e.g., decoding peacock patterns into coordinates) lack logical cause-effect. Pacing is brisk but leaves plot mechanics unexplained, weakening coherence despite a complete arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting's odd juxtaposition (paper airplanes vs. conspiracy) creates intrigue but remains unexplored. Atmosphere leans on visual metaphors (peacock feathers, seal) but lacks sensory detail beyond sight; tone contrasts well but isn't sustained through description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Central conflict and symbolism (peacock as coded message, seal as key) provide thematic cohesion. Emotional impact relies heavily on declarative statements about grief/vengeance rather than subtext or layered meaning. Ending feels resolved but abrupt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Attempts fresh integration of quirky elements (peacock as cipher tool, paper facility as sinister cover) but relies on revenge clichés. Some phrases border on purple prose ("cold, determined fire"). Nuanced emotional expression is minimal despite unconventional premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are interconnected but unevenly weighted—peacock/paper airplane facility relationship strains logic. Narrative brevity amplifies conceptual daring but sacrifices explanatory depth. Concept is memorable but execution feels constrained by list-checking rather than organic integration.</comment>
