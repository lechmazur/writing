<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's listlessness and naive sophistication are present but insufficiently nuanced. Motivation to find "intention" drives action but transformation feels abrupt; internal conflict lacks gradual development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a basic arc but pacing stumbles between Auberon's ennui and abrupt emotional shift. Resolution ties back effectively, yet the corn maze's symbolic payoff feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting's sensory details (damp earth, rustling) immerse briefly, but "haunted plain" remains underexplored. Atmosphere leans on vague descriptors rather than original, visceral imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of joy as intention resonate through contrast between Auberon's scarf and commoners' laughter. Ending leans slightly on "show-don't-tell" balance, but metaphors are cohesive and impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in concept but relies on familiar "nobility finds meaning among peasants" structure. Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction without earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some (timeframe, tone) serve more as superficial notes than integrated constraints. Length sharpens focus but limits deeper exploration of ironic awe's complexity.</comment>
