<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation to confront self-deception is clear and drives the narrative, but internal conflict is stated more than shown through tangible actions. The “skillfully incompetent” trait lacks concrete demonstration beyond thematic mentions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure moves from attic to vision to resolution, but transitions feel abrupt (e.g., vortex pull). The sculptor’s chisel metaphor is underdeveloped, weakening cause-effect logic. Pacing compresses emotional beats, sacrificing depth.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dusty attic has vivid details, but clockwork animals serve as inert atmosphere rather than symbolism. Timeframe (“sculptor’s chisel”) disconnects from setting. Tone leans on abstraction (“close distance”) without immersive sensory integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Symbols like the shard-as-mirror offer thematic weight, but subtext is shallow. Ending resolves too neatly without earned catharsis. Internal conflict relies on declarative language over visceral storytelling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies on self-realization tropes without subverting them. Descriptions (“whisper of what could have been”) border on cliché. Metaphors like “layers of bravado” lack specificity. Avoids purple prose but feels formulaic in emotional arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated. Sculptor’s chisel and clockwork animals lack narrative synergy. Brevisity constrains complexity, and thematic cohesion feels strained despite ambitious scope.</comment>
