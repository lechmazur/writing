<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elusive depth despite whimsical surface; motivation is clear but development lacks human/narrative complexity to make the character resonate beyond quaint premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meandering progression undermines coherence; the action’s emotional stakes never crystallize despite atmospheric flourishes, leaving arc hollow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive contrasts (frozen/geothermal) and sensory details elevate the atmosphere, though its thematic integration remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (straw as key) and reflective ending hint at deeper meaning, but tonal inconsistency and diffuse tension limit emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts subversion (solemnly silly caretaker) but leans on familiar ghostly motifs; exposition via “forbidden logs” feels derivative despite quirky execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere minimally; story is constrained by assignments rather than transcending them, though the geothermal orchard’s metaphor shows promise.</comment>
