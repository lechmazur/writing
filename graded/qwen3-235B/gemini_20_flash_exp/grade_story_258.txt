<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's traits (nimble, metaphysical) and motivation (preserving dances) are stated but underdemonstrated; her actions lack visceral emotional grounding despite thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic events rather than causal character decisions; the storm's urgency is abstract, undermining structural cohesion within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, if occasionally overwrought, sensory details create an immersive, mythic setting; metaphysical and elemental elements synergize well with the cultural preservation theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (storm, map as artifact) and atmospheric symbolism elevate the narrative, yet over-reliance on descriptive abstraction weakens emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Excessive ornateness and generic descriptors suggest formulaic tendencies; the jaded wonder tone often reads as affectation rather than earned perspective.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but sometimes mechanical in execution; the premise hints at depth but lacks transcendent thematic payoff or narrative closure.</comment>
