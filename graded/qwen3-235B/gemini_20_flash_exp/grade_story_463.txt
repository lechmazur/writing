<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Assigned attribute "dry-witted" is underdeveloped; character's actions and internal monologue lean toward solemn contemplation rather than wit. Motivation is clear but lacks complex psychological nuance. Actions align with traditional method pursuit but assigned trait's influence remains superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lacks traditional three-act structure within constrained word count. Some cause-effect logic (e.g., confiscation as pivotal choice) but momentum falters through repetitive metaphysical musings. Timeframe device (crossed-off name) creates artificial completion without substantial narrative arc development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric elements excel with sensory details (salt/decay scent, flickering candle shadows) but integration with character psychology uneven. Setting supports conceptual weight of decay/transience but haunted elements feel decorative rather than integral. Object-setting connection strong, though symbolic overemphasis dilutes emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (rope as broken vows) demonstrates thematic intent but relies on conventional symbols. Writing shows poetic ambition through rhythmic prose yet lacks distinctive voice. Ending's philosophical aspirations land mid-range between profundity and clich√©. Conflict remains abstract/internal without concrete manifestation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Derivative elements include haunted lighthouse trope and overfamiliar "weight of past" metaphor. Stylistic flourishes border on purple prose ("reckless precision" repetition). Emotional exploration remains cerebral rather than visceral. Dance motif shows invention but integration fails, suggesting algorithmic element combination rather than organic thematic development.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper narrative synergy. Writing demonstrates technical competence over artistic urgency. Brief format prevents full thematic and emotional flowering. Original conceptual seeds present but execution lacks differentiation from predictable pattern-based composition.</comment>
