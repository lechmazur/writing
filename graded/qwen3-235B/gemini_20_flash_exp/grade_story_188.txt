<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Kenji’s lawman past informs his actions but lacks psychological depth; motivations stated rather than embodied. Interactions with spectacles and letter feel symbolic without emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Seeds and letter drive the plot, but the arc is compressed, creating abrupt transitions. The resolution feels underdeveloped despite cohesive premise. Pacing uneven in tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on familiar seasonal imagery and vague historical associations. Sensory details present but thin; the castle’s history isn’t woven into the character’s journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (key/spectacles, ritual/seed planting) resonate, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract descriptors. Theme of rebirth implied but lacks visceral subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some clichés (“whisper of spring”) and overwrought phrases weaken authenticity. The concept subverts exile tropes slightly but remains derivative. Voice is distinct but occasionally stiff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists, but elements feel imposed rather than organic. The brevity hinders complexity, leaving themes underexplored. Lingering impression is vague rather than profound.</comment>
