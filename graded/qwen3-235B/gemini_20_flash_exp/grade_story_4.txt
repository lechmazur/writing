<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but underdeveloped; Lumina’s god-channeling identity dominates her personality, leaving little nuance beyond her mystical role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a linear mystical journey but lacks tension; the resolution feels abrupt despite effective use of the word limit for closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details (ozone, night flowers) and eerie setting cohesion; the greenhouse’s endless night enhances the mystical tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Impressive imagery and symbolism (thread, crystal) create thematic depth, but emotional resonance is dampened by abstract detachment from character inner life.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality is strong in concept (dj/gods, alchemical greenhouse) but occasionally undermined by ornate phrasing that veers into stylistic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements but occasionally forces them (e.g., filing, sweater thread); concept over character elevates the narrative’s speculative ambition.</comment>
