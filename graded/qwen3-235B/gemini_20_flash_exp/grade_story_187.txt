<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character traits are vaguely defined; "brash tenderness" lacks embodiment through action or dialogue; motivation of archival preservation is stated but not dramatized; reactions to objects/conflicts feel abstract rather than psychologically nuanced; voice remains indistinct beneath ornate prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot advances through static tableau rather than dynamic action; the assigned action "impose" is conceptually present but underdramatized; structure lacks traditional arc due to passive observations over active progression; pacing feels deliberately slow but risks reader detachment; coherence maintained but lacks organic cause-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (chalk spirits, damp earth) create immersive atmosphere; setting functions symbolically as both sacred space and archive; tonal contrast between "bland" floorboard and "vibrant chaos" enhances thematic tension; timeframe's poetic resonance outweighs practical narrative function; objects and place feel mythologically connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (floorboard as archive, chalk as spirits) elevates impact; theme of preservation vs. disruption emerges organically; ending offers contemplative closure rather than emotional punch; "showing" dominates but occasionally succumbs to abstract "telling" about tenderness/resolve; subtext about historical truth is intellectually stimulating but emotionally distant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy genre tropes (stoic wanderers, mystical teachers) without subversion; language veers into purple prose ("necessary lies," "brash tenderness"); sensory details are evocative but occasionally generic; psychological complexity implied but not demonstrated; metaphors like "chalk spirits" are imaginative yet familiar; emotional stakes remain surface-level despite thematic ambition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements coexist thematically but lack narrative integration; some items (floorboard, necessary lies) better utilized than others (nightmares, timeframe); brevity works conceptually but hinders emotional investment; tone/style aim for literary rigor but sacrifice character immediacy; thematic cohesion outweighs plot momentum.</comment>
