<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits are assigned rather than demonstrated; motivation is stated, not shown through meaningful action or choice. Emotional reactions lack nuance and are often told, not shown.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on convenient devices (mysterious phone call, sudden societal invitation); the limited word count doesn't allow sufficient cause-effect logic or emotional payoff for the transformation arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (haunted houses, secret societies, transformative calls) without meaningful subversion; writing style occasionally becomes overly ornate rather than purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements are incorporated but not deeply interconnected; short form reveals rather than explores the transformation; thematic resonance remains superficial despite poetic flourishes.</comment>
