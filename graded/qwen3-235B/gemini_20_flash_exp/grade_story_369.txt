<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character is philosophically consistent but lacks behavioral depth; motivations are conceptually articulated but not always embodied through concrete actions beyond introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plotted as a static meditation rather than a dynamic arc; tension persists but lacks forward momentum typical of publishable short fiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but don't achieve transcendent synergy; the constrained form serves thematic purposes but limits narrative expansion.</comment>
