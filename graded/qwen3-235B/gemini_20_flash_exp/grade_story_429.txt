<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent motivation (reviving heritage) but lacks deeper internal conflict; character traits shape actions but inner depth remains shallow.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression with clear cause-effect but pacing feels slightly rushed, especially in emotional shifts between baking and the family's reaction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (aromas, northern lights) enhance atmosphere; "folding of harvest" concept remains underdeveloped, slightly disjointing setting and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (scale as liberation) and thematic resonance; emotional beats often stated rather than subtly evoked, slightly diluting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concept is original but execution leans on familiar metaphors ("chains," "whispers of ancestors"); prose occasionally veers into ornate clich√© ("celestial chorus").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coherently interwoven but some feel decorative (northern lights' narrative purpose unclear); resonant theme elevates but doesn't transcend length constraints.</comment>
