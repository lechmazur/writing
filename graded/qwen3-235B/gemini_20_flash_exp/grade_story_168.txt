<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Agnes’s ruthlessness and intellectual spontaneity are hinted but underexplored; her actions revolve around curiosity more than ruthlessness, and her compulsion feels vaguely defined despite her methodical use of the comb.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc, but the brevity strains narrative momentum. The pause between verses drives urgency yet feels arbitrarily imposed, and the resolution—while thematic—is abrupt, leaving cause-effect logic underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stone circle’s atmosphere is vivid (sunlight, melancholic music) but sensory details lack specificity. The tone of “polite anarchy” contrasts poorly with the mystical setting, diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of observation vs. reflection resonate, but emotional impact is muted. Metaphors (stones as mirrors) are conceptually strong but undercut by exposition-heavy resolution. Dialogue feels artificially cryptic rather than natural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on “haunted by dreams” tropes. Prose is occasionally ornate (“whirlwind of connections” detracts from nuance) and the “watcher’s burden” reads as overly abstract, hinting at thematic overreach.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not symbiotic. The comb and rock art drive character and plot, but the “ruthless” flower arranger and “polite anarchy” lack narrative weight, making the story feel conceptually fragmented.</comment>
