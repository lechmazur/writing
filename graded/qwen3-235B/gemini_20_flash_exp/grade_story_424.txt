<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; the "oddly typical mild zealot" label lacks clear behavioral manifestation. Motivation (sacrifice via forgotten wishes) feels consistent but lacks psychological complexity. Emotional reactions often stated rather than shown through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a clear emotional arc, but lacks tension or conflict. Visualization sequence flows logically but remains static—no active progression or stakes. Pacing leans contemplative rather than urgent, which suits the theme but weakens narrative drive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Contrasts between sterile lab and tactile currency create effective atmosphere. Sensory details (humming machinery, faded bills) immerse readers, but "strange attractor laboratory" feels underutilized. Timeframe's "shifting powers" lack concrete narrative function despite atmospheric hints.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elicits reflection through symbolism (bills as scars of legacy) and vivid imagery (Moroccan souk, war-torn village). Ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional crescendo. Metaphors deepen the plot, though some sections rely on abstract assertions rather than immersive subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (redemptive power of historical empathy). Prose occasionally veers into ornate description ("rustic refinement," "tapestry of lives") without sufficient payoff. Subtle subversions—sacrifice framed through quotidian acts—offer originality, but execution risks sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but inconsistently in practice. The lab setting and "shifting powers" add mystery without narrative purpose. Language displays stylistic control and thematic ambition, but constrained by a lack of character dynamism or plot propulsion. Lingers intellectually rather than viscerally.</comment>
