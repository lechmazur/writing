<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyra's rebellious nature and role as an obituarist for the living are established, but her internal complexity remains underdeveloped. Her connection to the mask and organ chamber reveals motivation, yet emotional depth feels abbreviated in the limited space.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear structure—introduction to task, journey through symbolic setting, climactic writing—but the 500-word constraint strains cohesion between revolution references and the central obituary theme. Pacing shifts abruptly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elegant imagery (skeletal pipes, labyrinthine shelves) creates visual atmosphere, but sensory details remain sparse. The revolutionary backdrop's tension isn't integrated into setting or tone, weakening thematic resonance between decay and societal unrest.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The central metaphor—obituaries as life-reclamation—packs conceptual punch. The mask's shifting expressions and symbolic organ resonance show craftsmanship, though emotional weight feels diluted by brevity. The ending's thematic clarity elevates impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes, but revolution rumors and "almost-dead" concepts border on abstract. The organ chamber's mysticism lacks grounding logic. Language occasionally leans on familiar Gothic flourishes without fully reimagining them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are cleverly interwoven (mask-organ synergy) yet unevenly weighted—the revolution thread feels tacked on. The compressed format sacrifices depth in character emotional arcs and worldbuilding, though the core obituary concept lingers memorably.</comment>
