<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Main character's motivations as a "social media exorcist" feel abstract and underexplored; actions lack psychological nuance. The protagonist's internal logic remains inconsistent despite an intriguing premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but uneven pacing; transitions between locations rely on superficial connections. Cause-effect progression exists but lacks narrative urgency within the compressed scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere built on generic descriptors ("grime," "dimly lit"); inconsistent sensory details fail to ground the reader. Evocative potential squandered through vague, repetitive imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Elegant prose contrasts digital/real duality with poetic efficacy. Subtle emotional undercurrents present, but surface-level thematic exploration prevents deeper resonance. Ending requires greater specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Conceptual framework offers innovation, but execution occasionally relies on modern clich√©s ("digital demons"). Avoids outright tropes through atmospheric originality despite some imprecise details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic layering destabilizes cohesion; assigned elements feel partially forced. Narrative brevity works conceptually but undermines character and setting development.</comment>
