<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character traits of impulsiveness and whimsy inconsistently manifest; motivation (righting historical wrong) is clear but underdeveloped beyond surface-level family lore.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed yet coherent, but celestial tracking method strains plausibility; pacing uneven, with rushed resolution undermining emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elegantly rendered atmosphere with vivid sensory details; ruined fortress and twilight timeframe enhance mood, though deeper integration with character’s internal state is missing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Uses metaphor and imagery effectively, but emotional resonance is undercut by told emotions rather than fully embodied subtext; ending feels slightly sentimental rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in concept (celestial mapping) but occasionally relies on ornate phrasing; whimsy risks feeling performative rather than intrinsic to character voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock mechanically well but lack transformative cohesion; the brief length amplifies narrative elegance while limiting thematic depth.</comment>
