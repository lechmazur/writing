<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's hardheadedness and brokenness are consistent but underexplored; her introspective monologue dominates over revealing traits through actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure is coherent with an arc from seeking solace to resolution, but the tight limit leaves pacing uneven, with rushed transitions between introspection and realization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective sensory details (snow's crunch, cold metal) enhance mood; snow and gallery evoke melancholy but lack deeper symbolic integration with the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., library fading) hint at internal growth, but themes of healing/vulnerability are stated more than shown, diluting emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but has overly ornate phrasing; emotions are occasionally nuanced (e.g., demure audacity), though some elements like the grove feel predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but lack narrative urgency; the ending provokes reflection but feels incomplete—promising, yet not fully realized.</comment>
