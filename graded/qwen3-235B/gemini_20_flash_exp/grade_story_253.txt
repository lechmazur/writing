<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth; "polite bandit" trait remains superficially portrayed without concrete demonstration of how it impacts interactions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear path but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between harp's melody and chip discovery lacks sufficient narrative scaffolding; timeframe compression weakens stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through rich synesthesia - servers humming, light pulsing, and harp's dissonance create immersive techno-ruin vibe; time-scarred setting remains consistent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Premise provokes philosophical questions about time but relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than embodied experiences; symbolism feels occasionally pretentious rather than illuminating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s but contains borderline purple prose ("silence a little more profound"); some metaphors fresh (servers as electronic wilderness) while "master of time" concept leans on genre tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements forced into coherence rather than emerging organically; writing demonstrates technical proficiency but lacks authorial voice that would elevate material beyond well-crafted exercise.</comment>
