<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mute trait remains superficial, motivation hinted but not deeply interrogated; boldness lacks nuanced manifestation beyond ritual compliance; courier identity disconnected from narrative function</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Portal creation drives linear progression but resolution feels abrupt; structural integrity maintained within constraints yet lacks narrative tension or subversion</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cumulative effect is striking yet unevenly executed; brevity serves theme but sacrifices organic character evolution and logistical coherence</comment>
