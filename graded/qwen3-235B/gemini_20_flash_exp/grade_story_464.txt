<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's sassiness and mischief are present but underdeveloped; connection between "cook" and actions feels forced. Motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth, actions align with goals but lack emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot is driven by the "fracture" action but relies on vague machinery - cause/effect between chests and consequences glossed over. Arc exists but is shallow - beginning/end connection present yet underdeveloped within word count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective use of sterile vs. chaotic imagery; twilight framing creates eerie atmosphere. Polaroid visuals and distorted realities enhance mood, but deeper connection between "reality calibration" mechanics and sensory details remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "simmering plan" and "jelly walls" show creativity. Evokes curiosity but not deep emotional resonance - tension between order/chaos theme is surface-level. Ending lacks philosophical or emotional pay-off.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains slightly ornate descriptions ("delightful absurdity"). Sensory details specific yet occasionally generic. Shows moderate originality through reality-warping mechanics but doesn't fully subvert expectations about chaos agents.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively with occasional friction. Short form works for chaotic vignette but lacks lingering impact. Combines components creatively though some (cook background) more decorative than structural.</comment>
