<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; "bizarre" traits are stated, not demonstrated. The necromancer's abilities lack integration with actions, weakening personality distinctness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through discovery of mural coordinates, but pacing feels rushed. Logical gaps (e.g., sudden map revelation) disrupt flow; ending lacks resolution, undermining narrative completeness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid retro gaming visuals and pixelated atmosphere enhance mood, but sensory details remain superficial. The simulated moonlight and glitching mural connect to setting but fail to deepen thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attempts thematic depth (systemic lies, rebellion) but relies on surface-level tension. The glowing fishhook and mural-as-map have symbolic potential undercut by abrupt pacing and lack of emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but blends necromancy-digital worlds unevenly. Some imagery (glitching colors, digital hammer footsteps) feels fresh, while phrases like "battleground for truth" lean formulaic. Subtlety in character psychology is missing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly fused. The story aims for mystery but lacks depth to sustain its themes. The brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, leaving concepts underexplored despite creative core.</comment>
