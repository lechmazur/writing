<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rationally emotional smuggler is inconsistently realized; traits mentioned more than demonstrated through nuanced decisions. Desperation for acceptance drives action but lacks layered internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alarm structure provides clear scaffolding but feels mechanical rather than organic progression. Pacing maintains momentum yet sacrifices deeper tension development within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cobweb textures, metallic alarm sounds, and decaying funhouse details create atmospheric tension. Contrast between clover's fragility and setting's decay amplifies thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (clover/alarms) carries emotional weight but relies heavily on stated motifs. Jubilant despair concept is intriguingly paradoxical yet underexplored beyond surface descriptions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Haunted park and acceptance-seeking tropes remain conventionally rendered. Alarm method borders on gimmickry; emotional beats often summarized rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but story feels like framework awaiting richer development. Short form exposes rather than fulfills narrative's potential depth.</comment>
