<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth; motivations are stated rather than dramatized through consistent, meaningful actions tied to "shifty" or "spontaneous" traits. Internal conflict remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Minimalist structure shows determination but lacks causality between elements. Parole hearing and caravan chasing coexist without narrative propulsion. Pacing balanced but static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere through sparse imagery (tattered screen, shifting amethyst) but insufficient sensory immersion. Setting functions as mood rather than integral pressure-cooker for character's actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical ambition with crystal patterns mirroring emotions, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized. Theme of redemption through obsession underdeveloped despite symbolic framework.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Purple prose emerges in "crystalline dust" descriptions, while surrealism borders on pretension. Originality in caravan mineralizing method countered by clich√©d redemption arc scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stylized fragments create intriguing tonal experiments but lack narrative cohesion across elements. Attempts to blend philosophical inquiry with magical realism remain half-formed.</comment>
