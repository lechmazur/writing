<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character development feels conceptually sound but emotionally distant; motivations are stated more than dramatized, with empathy emerging mechanically rather than organically from his backstory, though his childhood envy ties coherently to his fixation on understanding others' "echoes of yearning"</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through a single transformative action, but the pivotal moment of projecting fingerprints strains verisimilitude with abrupt resolution; the tight word limit creates narrative imbalance between setup (personal backstory) and payoff (hive transformation), though the circular structure connecting past/present is effective</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visionary setting (beehive as restless living organism) is underexploited—auditory motifs dominate at the expense of other senses, creating atmospheric flatness; the hive’s physical architecture remains abstract, weakening the impact of Silas operating within it as both sanctuary and "restless beast"</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric fingerprints-as-identity succeed thematically but falter technically (could microscopic patterns actually convey "yearning"?); the final symphonic unity of voices creates emotional resonance, though the narrative leans on poetic abstraction rather than earned emotional beats to achieve catharsis</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unique conceptualization (police-state metaphors averted) but employs familiar redemption-through-understanding arcs; prose maintains consistent tone despite occasional over-decorated phrases ("chorus of recognition"), while the central device (fingerprint mapping as societal panacea) lacks scientific plausibility at critical moments</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but occasionally forced—the ruler becomes a thematic anchor through repetition rather than organic integration; the brevity emphasizes symbolism over realism, creating a polished allegorical surface that invites analysis but lacks visceral impact</comment>
