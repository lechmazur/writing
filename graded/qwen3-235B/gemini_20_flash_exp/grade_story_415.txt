<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but relies heavily on abstract sensory associations rather than concrete actions or internal conflict; the palate-as-mnemonic device feels underexplored despite its potential for deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is fragmented; the method of tracking rain trails lacks logical cohesion, and the transition from stadium to valley feels abrupt; the word limit strains the narrative arc's believability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vivid but inconsistent sensory details—taste dominates at the expense of other senses; the "yodeling valley" and stadium are juxtaposed without sufficient thematic or emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses metaphor effectively (forgiveness as a "journey, one taste at a time") but leans on clichéd phrasing ("symphony of bitterness"); the ending is emotionally resonant but risks oversimplification.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Idea is original but execution strays into purple prose ("synthetically organic artifact," "ruminative exasperation"); emotional depth is undercut by overly abstract descriptions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves thematic cohesion but struggles with pacing and conceptual clarity; its brevity feels constrained rather than purposeful, leaving some elements underdeveloped.</comment>
