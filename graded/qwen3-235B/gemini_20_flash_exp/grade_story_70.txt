<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation feels somewhat abrupt, but his motivation and actions related to the bulb/adhesive do illustrate internal conflict and growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot connects beginning and end thematically, but the sudden realization lacks sufficient buildup; the adhesive analysis feels narratively forced despite logical coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (graveyard greenhouse, metallic aroma) enhance mood and theme; the setting’s liminality mirrors Elias’s psychological transition effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (adhesive as empathy) are potent, and the ending’s thematic clarity elevates the narrative, though the emotional payoff feels slightly sentimental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by subverting "magic versus science" tropes; the witch’s cryptic role and Tesla bulb feel fresh, though some phrasing skirts ornateness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere for the most part, but the story leans on symbolic abstraction over narrative specificity; the brief length constrains deeper exploration of the transformation.</comment>
