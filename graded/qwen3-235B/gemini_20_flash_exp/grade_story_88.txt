<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional dimensionality; motivation is clear but abstract, actions lack nuance, and the "mathematically poetic" trait remains underdeveloped. Voice is consistent but overly diffuse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Predictable cyclical structure lacks tension; plot progression is inert, driven by exposition over action. Cause-effect relationships are blurred, ending feels artificially repetitive rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Visually striking but tonally disjointed; the Sumerian palace/toaster juxtaposition and "shouting silence" concept clash rather than complement. Sensory details are stylized but emotionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Relies on poetic descriptions to mask narrative inertia. Themes of preservation/ephemerality are hinted but unexplored. Ending offers no revelation or emotional payoff. "Telling" dominates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Excessive metaphor density (e.g., "mathematically poetic," "shouting silence") verges on abstraction. Tropes like AI archivists and holographic relics feel derivative; emotional motifs are stated, not earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements are superficially included rather than integrated; the brevity amplifies structural gaps. Ambition exceeds execution, resulting in a hollow, ornamental aesthetic without thematic rigor.</comment>
