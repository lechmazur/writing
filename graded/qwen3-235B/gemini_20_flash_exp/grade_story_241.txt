<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., pulsing vest, train flickers) create immersion, but the floating cloud cafe’s surreal potential is underutilized, weakening its thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (e.g., silence as a canvas) suggest depth, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract, often vague declarations of inner states without concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but rarely intersect dynamically; the story’s brevity feels constrained rather than purposeful, with themes hinted at but not fully interrogated.</comment>
