<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits motivation (guilt), but lacks depth in psychological complexity and consistent emotional demonstration through actions rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure has clear beginning/ending, but thin middle development. Pacing uneven; cause/effect logical but lacks layered progression within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting attempts immersive atmosphere with sensory details, but connection between "jungle curator" role and temple remains underdeveloped. Visual elements present but thematic integration inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (ice violin/growth), but emotional impact diluted by explicit statements like "roar of guilt." Ending conceptually resonant but execution lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original premise elements (ice violin, floating museum) avoid clich√©s, but contains predictable emotional arcs and ornate phrasing that occasionally distracts from substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Element cohesion adequate but not exceptional. Some forced aspects (e.g., "road trip" terminology), and the brevity limits thematic exploration despite poetic undertones.</comment>
