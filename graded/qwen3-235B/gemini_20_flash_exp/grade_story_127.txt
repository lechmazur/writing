<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to seek peace feels underdeveloped; reactions to the gauntlet and coral memory lack nuanced psychological depth, making emotional transitions abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves a basic arc within constraints, but the pivotal memory-triggered breakthrough feels contrived; pacing unevenly balances introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Steampunk lounge atmosphere is superficially vivid but jarringly contrasts with coral reef flashbacks; sensory details fail to cohesively merge these disparate worlds.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Powerful central metaphor of the gauntlet as both weapon and bridge; the haunting melody's subtext effectively conveys unspoken reconciliation, though ending feels unresolved.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Some forced transitions (coral texture inspiring music) and clich√©d phrases ("tapestry of past") undercut originality; emotional desperation relies too heavily on explicit descriptions.</comment>
