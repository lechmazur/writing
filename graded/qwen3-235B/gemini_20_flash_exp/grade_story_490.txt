<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; motivations expressed through abstract concepts rather than relatable behaviors. The paradoxical traits of "methodically random" and "enthusiastic apathy" remain rhetorical rather than embodied in meaningful character actions. No observable change or realization despite narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical structure (beginning/ending with lavender imagery), but lacks dramatic progression. Hacking sequence feels static - discovery of star system lacks emotional or narrative consequence. Pacing suits meditative tone but sacrifices momentum, with cause-effect relationships existing only at superficial level.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rust/salt atmosphere effectively establishes desolation, but sensory details remain isolated observations rather than integrated environment. The caravan repair station's specific mechanics (tools, machinery) aren't utilized to enhance plot or character. Timeframe implication of post-wave world is atmospheric but underexploited narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness (tumbleweed, newborn galaxy) elevates prose, with atmospheric tension between organic lavender scent and mechanical decay. The paradoxical tone creates thematic resonance about emptiness and fulfillment. Ends with thematic clarity but lacks emotional punch, offering contemplation over catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unusual combinations (enthusiastic apathy, methodically random), but occasionally lapses into ornamental abstraction rather than visceral specificity. The "digital labyrinth" metaphor works, though hacking remains vague. Descriptions prioritize poetic resonance over technical authenticity, risking slight genericism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coherently interweave with central theme of seeking meaning in decay, though lavender's symbolism feels schematic. Voice maintains consistent tonal register, with brevity feeling purposeful. Prompt elements (hacking archives, post-wave setting) structurally function well, but some components (caravan mechanics) remain underutilized.</comment>
