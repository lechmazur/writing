<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Motivation for pushing limits remains abstract, inconsistent with poison harm; philosophical framing lacks emotional depth despite verbose introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels rushed—cryptic clues/payoff dynamic underdeveloped; scavenger hunt pacing strained by word limit, undermining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Museum atmosphere evocative but underutilized—"dusty starlight" works visually, but auditory/tactile details (e.g., skateboard echoes) sporadically deepen setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphor integration (fractured rapier as fragility) and ironic subtext (art as weaponization) elevate thematic resonance despite narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on "tortured artist" tropes; poetic flourishes (e.g., "hummingbird heart") balance against vague psychological nuance in villain logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused—skateboarding/museum juxtaposition and rapier symbolism stand out, while "code of instinct" and gravity themes remain underexplored.</comment>
