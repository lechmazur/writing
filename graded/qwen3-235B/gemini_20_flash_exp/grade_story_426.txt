<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "angrily peaceful" are conceptually intriguing but feel stated rather than demonstrated. Motivation (preserving heritage) is clear, but reactions to objects (teapot, playlist) lack sufficient nuance to fully embody his internal conflict. The paradoxical calm/anger dynamic remains superficially sketched.</comment>   
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot has a coherent structure (discovery → journey → harvest → resolution), but marathon training and ghost train repetitions add vague tension rather than concrete narrative progression. Pacing feels slightly compressed, with playlist-hacking process under-explained despite its central role.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Haunted amusement park creates an evocative, eerie backdrop, with effective decay-scent details and ghost train symbolism. Atmosphere supports the melancholic tone but underutilizes the setting’s potential to mirror cultural erasure themes. Sensory details are vivid but inconsistently distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The teapot and playlists create meaningful symbolism around memory transmission. The final herb-harvesting moment achieves emotional resonance through understated physical gestures. Some clichéd phrasing ("angrily peaceful," "aloof passion") undercuts deeper thematic exploration of cultural preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Haunted park and "coded playlists" veer toward familiar tropes. Metaphors like "manufactured horrors vs. real fears" feel conceptually thin. Emotional beats (tear, teapot hug) lean on conventional imagery rather than psychological specificity. Writing occasionally slips into portentousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story coherently incorporates all elements but unevenly integrates them—marathon training and ghost train repetition feel tangential rather than thematic necessities. Brevity creates elegance in some moments (herb discovery) but truncates others (playlist decoding process). Lingering emotional impact is modest.</comment>
