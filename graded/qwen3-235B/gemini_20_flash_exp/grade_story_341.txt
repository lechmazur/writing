<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development feels slightly rushed; Elias' internal transformation lacks nuance despite clear motivations. His cautious archivist persona is consistent but under-explored beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structurally sound but predictable arc; transitions between acts lack tension. The central action drives progression, but the word limit weakens the sense of risk or stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting is visually vivid but underutilized; the serpent skull fortress could deepen symbolism. Sensory details are present but unevenly distributed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes resonate intellectually but lack emotional punch. Symbolism (rosary as compass) is effective yet feels somewhat contrived. Ending leans on closure over complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "solitary scholar finds purpose" archetypes. Language occasionally veers into florid abstraction; subtext could be more layered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not innovatively reimagined. The story’s ambition exceeds its execution within the constraints; ideas outweigh visceral impact.</comment>
