<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "subtlety" is abstract and inconsistently demonstrated; motivations for seeking wisdom are stated but lack psychological nuance, reducing depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but occasionally feels rushed; cause/effect is logical but some transitions between revelations are abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (e.g., "calcified branch," "translucent hollows"), though the petrified forest's connection to the schematic is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and subtext (wisdom through restraint); ending resonates thematically but emotional impact is uneven due to abstract prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Frequent poetic abstraction borders on purple prose; motifs like "lucid confusion" feel overused, reducing uniqueness despite original thematic framing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solid cohesion but lacks breakthrough innovation; thematic layering is present but doesn't fully transcend genre conventions.</comment>
