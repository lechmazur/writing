<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's role as a soul-broker lacks depth; motivation to learn forgotten songs is stated but not emotionally shown through nuanced actions. Personality remains abstract, defined more by descriptors than lived choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear sequence but feels compressed; cause-effect connections between decoding labels and summoning melodies rely on vague metaphysical logic. Pacing lags in mid-section but culminates in an evocative resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric setting evokes atmosphere through shimmering light, whispering air, and tactile mist/sound details. "Weirdly static" energy and recycling time amplify mood but remain underexplored conceptually.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic rain of petals resonate thematically, though emotional stakes lack intimate grounding. Metaphors for cultural memory are profound but occasionally undercut by overly ornate phrasing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally indulges in ornate descriptions ("grandiose modesty") that feel performative. Reversed-label mechanic borders on artificial puzzle-box construction rather than organic narrative device.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements coexist but unevenly integrate; the soul-broker profession and choreography feel extraneous to the core mystery of lost melodies. Conceptual elegance outweighs structural precision in this brief form.</comment>
