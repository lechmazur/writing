<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations are abstract and inconsistently rendered, with vague connections between actions and assigned traits. No distinct voice or emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks cohesive arc or momentum; events exist in isolation without strong causality or resolution. Pacing meanders without clear direction despite word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting is visually rich but underutilizedâ€”sensory details feel vague or generic. Atmosphere contrasts tone and concept unevenly, failing to deepen narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Themes of mortality and impermanence are present but underdeveloped; symbolism and imagery lack emotional resonance. Ending feels thematic but hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (art-meets-science, prophetic devices) without subversion. Some fresh metaphors obscured by ornate but hollow phrasing and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ideas are conceptually intriguing but unevenly executed; elements feel compartmentalized rather than integrated. Lingering questions about theme are underexplored.</comment>
