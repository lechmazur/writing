<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character traits like "shifty" and "spontaneous" are superficially mentioned but inconsistently demonstrated; motivation to "unify conflicting hearts" lacks psychological depth or earned emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Fragmented structure mimics Lester's mental state but sacrifices coherence; surreal elements (circus caravans, mineralization) drive the plot yet feel arbitrarily introduced without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lunar-lit drive-in and mineralizing caravans create haunting visuals, but the "anguished joy" tone is unevenly sustained; sensory details focus disproportionately on sight while neglecting other senses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (projection as healing, microscope as redemption) show promise but remain underexplored; the ending's "unspoken harmony" feels unearned rather than transcendently poignant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on surrealism-as-substance; "mineralizing sorrow" concept borders on vague symbolism; dialogue absence avoids the issue but sacrifices character nuance; atmospheric flourishes overshadow thematic rigor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overloaded with conceptual elements that compete rather than coalesce; brevity exposes structural weaknesses rather than enhancing focus; memorable imagery cannot compensate for thematic murkiness.</comment>
