<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent voice but motivation feels vague. The stoicism clashes with sudden emotional shifts; interactions lack psychological nuance despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive arc within constraints, but the wallet-return subplot strains believability. The encounter-to-sanctuary transition feels slightly curated rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lush descriptors create atmosphere but disconnected settings—neon bar vs. moonlit hives lack narrative glue. Timeframe (post-band play) is underutilized to build tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like the paper plane work symbolically, but emotional depth is surface-layer. Theme of sincerity resonates yet relies too heavily on declarative phrasing over subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through idiosyncratic combinations (pirate radio + beekeepers). Subverts "pompous humility" trope effectively. Minimal purple prose, though some phrases flirt with affectation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements are individually rich but unevenly integrated; the wallet and sanctuary feel more tacked-on than thematic. Lingering question of sincerity vs. pretension lingers ambiguously.</comment>
