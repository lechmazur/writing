<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Characters lack depth; Darius' swindler facade and redemption arc feel underdeveloped, with insufficient nuance in his internal conflict. Marisol's role is functionally symbolic but emotionally unexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot pushes forward through arbitrary connections (e.g., dropped book) and a rushed climax. Cause-effect logic is present but strained by the compressed word limit, making the resolution feel imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shattered glass prisms, humming generator) create atmospheric tension. The setting’s blend of decay and renewal enhances the story’s emotional undercurrents, though some elements (invisible allies) remain detached.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in the blank price tag and coded logs, but emotional impact is dulled by clichéd redemption tropes. Subtext about truth and accountability exists but lacks complexity due to insufficient character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting is original, but the redemption arc follows predictable patterns (rogue’s conscience, meet-cute catalyst). Purple prose appears in over-explaining concepts ("gentle harshness") rather than embedding them through subtext and action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere勉强 (barely), but the story leans too heavily on trope-based construction (e.g., dropped book) rather than organic integration. Literary ambition is evident, yet constrained by formulaic structure.</comment>
