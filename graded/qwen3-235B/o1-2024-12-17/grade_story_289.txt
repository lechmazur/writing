<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character's traits and motivations are stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; the porcelain doll serves as a symbolic device but lacks organic integration with character decisions; inconsistent voice and underdeveloped internal conflict undermine emotional investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses predictably with formulaic revelation; ephemeral art as a method feels arbitrarily disconnected from resolution; pacing swings between rushed exposition and stagnant description; cause-effect chains weakened by unearned emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from vivid sensory details (bioluminescence, neon waves) that inconsistently support tone; futuristic timeframe feels superficially applied rather than organically shaping the setting; object-environment relationship underdeveloped beyond basic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Attempts at poetic diction and metaphor occasionally land but often feel forced (e.g., "awkward elegance"); theme of fragility/strength lacks narrative embodiment; ending provides closure but fails to deliver emotional or intellectual resonance beyond surface-level sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Repetitive abstract descriptors ("ephemeral," "fashionably timeless") signal formulaic phrasing; overreliance on genre tropes (mysterious bay, lost civilization) without subversion; inconsistent tone shifts suggest algorithmic transitions; emotional resonance primarily stated rather than shown through character nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Weakened cohesion from competing elements; many assigned components feel checklist-ticked rather than organically integrated; style prioritizes ornamental diction over clarity; short length exposes structural gaps rather than amplifying tension; thematic underdevelopment prevents lingering impact.</comment>
