<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Statue's motivations (truth-seeking, emotional resonance) are conceptually clear but underdeveloped through active choices; reactions to the hair tie and calligrapher remain abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structured as a lyrical vignette rather than a plot-driven narrative; progression from isolation to connection feels logically coherent but relies on poetic juxtaposition rather than cause-effect dynamics or narrative tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Richly textured with steam, soot, and gaslight details; the setting's oppressive beauty enhances the tone but doesn't influence character decisions or thematic resolution materially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Skillful use of symbolism (hair tie as lost promises, calligraphy as truth-seeking) creates emotional resonance; ending delivers thematic closure but lacks visceral immediacy despite lyrical prose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Demonstrates stylistic mastery and thematic cohesion but feels more like a fragment of a larger narrative; brevity amplifies poetic impact at the expense of structural ambition.</comment>
