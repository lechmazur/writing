<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Few distinct traits beyond assigned descriptors; motivation and actions feel abstract, not deeply rooted in psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Structure follows predictable redemption arc with abrupt resolution; pacing uneven within tight constraints but maintains basic coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</question><comment>Elements function but coexistence feels additive rather than transformative; formal qualities admirable but insufficient for transcendent impact.</comment>
