<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prophet's conflicting traits surface but lack depth; motivations implied through abstract goals rather than concrete development. Voice remains thematic, not fully human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot hinges on conceptual motifs rather than conventional structure; progression from introduction to oath feels linear but abstract, with underdeveloped cause-effect dynamics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original combination of elements (rummage-sale puzzles, cosmic scramble) avoids clich√©s; occasional overwrought phrasing distracts but doesn't fully undermine ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists, but execution feels constrained by imposed elements; abstract style intrigues yet hinders emotional resonance.</comment>
