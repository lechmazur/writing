<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but underdeveloped; motivations are hinted but lack psychological depth. Impulsively thoughtful nature is inconsistently demonstrated through overly poetic abstraction rather than concrete behavioral patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear redemption arc but suffers from compressed pacing; key turning points feel rushed, particularly the genius's rekindled hope. Assigned elements drive the narrative unevenly, with social upheaval never meaningfully intersecting with the underwater mission.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Underwater laboratory's sensory details create a compellingly claustrophobic atmosphere; "fractured grace" effectively permeates environmental descriptions. Timeframe's social upheaval remains an unexplored background element rather than atmospheric pressure shaping character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbolism of charcoal as a token and metaphor for extinguished/relit creativity is poignant; ending achieves emotional resonance through subtle gesture rather than grand declaration. Some emotional beats rely on abstract language over visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival descriptions ("waterlogged labs," "dust-littered beakers") border on formulaic melancholia. Core concept's exploration of betrayal feels clich√©d through echo metaphor repetition, though the underwater genius/savior dynamic offers moderate originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements mostly integrate without friction, but several (charcoal's power, superstition mechanics) operate without narrative consequence. Tight word count leaves social upheaval and genius's technical failures underexplored, weakening thematic unity.</comment>
