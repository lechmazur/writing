<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Ghostly caretaker's motivation to communicate with animals is clear but lacks psychological depth; "solemnly silly" attribute remains superficially sketched despite vivid actions that partially embody it.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity through frozen orchard's bookends, but pacing compresses mystical progression; forbidden logs' influence on actions feels narratively efficient yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Frozen orchard's geothermal contrast offers rich imagery, but the plastic straw's whimsy clashes with atmosphere; sensory coherence weakened by tonal dissonance between mystical and mundane elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cosmic loom" elevate themes, while the owl/badger scenes show skillful showing-over-telling; ending's ephemeral resolution balances poetic ambition against underexplored emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inventive combinations (geothermal orchards, plastic straws), but occasionally slips into ornate abstractions like "gentle chaos" that border on self-indulgent artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story achieves formal cohesion through persistent metaphors and tight structure, though conceptual ambition exceeds emotional investment; crystalline imagery lingers despite underdeveloped character interiority.</comment>
