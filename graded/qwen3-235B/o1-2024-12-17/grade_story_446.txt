<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character remains abstract due to over-reliance on repetitive descriptors ("peaceful anger," "amiable") without psychological depth; motivation is stated rather than dramatized through specific actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Plot circles static imagery rather than progressing through causally linked events; lacks discernible arc or resolution despite tight constraints; repetitive phrasing ("hydrolyze," "petals") undermines momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Vivid but disconnected sensory details (fireflies' glow) contrast with sterile metaphysical concepts (unbecoming); setting lacks integration with plot or character psychology beyond occasional symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwrought metaphors and tautological symbolism (petals = unbecoming) dominate; no meaningful subtext beneath surface themes; emotional tone feels preordained rather than earned through narrative revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Showcases algorithmic tendencies through redundant phrasing ("hydrolyze," "petals"), pseudo-profound abstraction, and generic emotional beats; metaphors lack specificity while straining to evoke "depth."</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Narrative feels like checklist fulfillment of assigned elements rather than organic synthesis; themes remain declarative rather than emerging through concrete storytelling; style obscures rather than enhances substance.</comment>
