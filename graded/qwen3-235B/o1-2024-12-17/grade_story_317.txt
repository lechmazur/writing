<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are stated rather than demonstrated; motivation is clear but the android's nostalgic elements feel underexplored, with actions driven more by plot needs than organic development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc, but transitions between exploration of betrayal and technical sabotage feel rushed; coherence maintained despite constraints, though some developments lack buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively described but inconsistently grounded; sensory details focus on visuals/tech, but emotional weight of dawn and crystals could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of betrayal and sacrifice resonate, but emotional engagement is filtered through exposition; literary devices like crystal-etched data are creative but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some originality in blending sci-fi with mystery, but character reasoning feels overly mechanistic; reliance on tropes like "hidden sabotage" and slightly overwrought metaphors detracts from human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Elements are serviceable but occasionally forced; the brevity feels limiting rather than deliberate, though the levitation concept ties cohesively to the stakes.</comment>
