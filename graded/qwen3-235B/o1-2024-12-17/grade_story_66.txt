<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking belonging) is consistent and ties to actions, but internal psychology lacks depth. The 'quiet deserter' persona is evocative but remains abstract rather than viscerally lived.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a wandering emotional arc rather than clear cause-effect progression. Beginning and end connect thematically but lose momentum through overly abstract transitions and underdeveloped key turning points.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory details (flickering lights, glowing plants), though the sterile lab setting could be more distinctively realized. The 'dizzyingly grounded' tone works well within the constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (mirror/reflection as fractured hope) and lyrical metaphor. The ending synthesizes theme and image effectively, though emotional resonance is occasionally undercut by occasionally ornate prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s through innovative pairing of plant communication with existential human themes, though some poetic phrasing ('noble foolishness') feels self-consciously literary rather than organically developed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the narrative purposefully, with particularly strong integration of mirror and belonging themes. The compact form works despite occasional pacing unevenness, leaving a haunting impression of fragmented searching.</comment>
