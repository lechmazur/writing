<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is conceptually distinct but lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but thinly explored within the word limit, relying more on symbolism than authentic human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot moves from contemplation to resolution but feels compressed; prophecy anchors the arc, though pacing unevenly balances exposition and revelation, with some abrupt emotional shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually evocative (glowing patch, steam, chamber) but sensory details lack specificity; setting supports tone but doesn't deepen the narrative's thematic undercurrents.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Solid use of metaphor and symbolism, but emotional resonance is undercut by abstract generalizations; ending resolves the arc but lacks visceral impact or lingering ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ideas avoid strict clich√©s but lean on familiar archetypes (prophecy, cosmic destiny); language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction, and subtext is hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is achieved but strained; elements serve the theme but feel curated rather than organically integrated; style leans on lyrical abstraction, risking clarity for depth.</comment>
