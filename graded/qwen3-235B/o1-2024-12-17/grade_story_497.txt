<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Logical progression through the palace exists, but the 500-word constraint makes discoveries feel rushed. Coded scuff mark resolution connects structure but lacks gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Post-glacier setting provides dystopian context, but "pristine chaos" tone often feels vague. Sensory details like spectral water are evocative but unevenly distributed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don't fully integrateâ€”skating rink/coded marks feels contrived. The ending delivers thematic closure but lacks lingering complexity for post-reading reflection.</comment>
