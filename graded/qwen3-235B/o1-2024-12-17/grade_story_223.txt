<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (confronting lies) is clear but inadequately explored; "awkwardly charming" trait barely influences decisions or interactions; seasickness is mentioned but doesn't meaningfully shape choices or voice</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has formal structure (arrival -> moon tracking -> confrontation) but rushes key developments; cause/effect relationships (bulb/moon phase connection) feel arbitrary; pacing uneven in tight word limit</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Crystal fortress and canyon offer vivid, immersive visuals but atmospheric elements (centuries of longing) remain abstract; setting supports tone but lacks tangible connection to character psychology</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery (moonlight "captive" in mirrors) but relies on telling over showing (vow-keeping, defiance stated rather than demonstrated); theme of truth vs illusion emerges late and superficially</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original combinations (ghost orchid + moon phases) exist but undercut by overwrought metaphors ("lifeline in stormy seas") and predictable fantasy tropes; emotional delivery feels mechanical rather than organic</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>All elements present but some (timeframe, traded secrets) feel forced; brief length suits mythic structure but lacks emotional or conceptual depth; stylish surface without lingering resonance</comment>
