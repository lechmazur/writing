<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Character's restless ambition and motivation are clear but remain abstract without deeper psychological exploration; actions like adapting to road closure are consistent but lack personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has coherent arc from obstacle to improvised solution, but pacing feels slightly meandering; cause-effect between road closure and spiritual climax is implied but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere of layered tranquility is vividly rendered through sensory details like shimmering pearls and damp walls, though deeper integration of "cave pearl diving school" as a thematic space is missing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery ("ghost of unformed ideas") and recursive structure (opening/closing with reflection) provide emotional resonance; subtext about creativity as spiritual inheritance emerges subtly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "complexly simple" verge on clich√© despite fresh context; tone remains consistent but occasional ornate phrasing ("transfigured reality") distracts from emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohere thematically, though "road closure" feels contrived to force plot; poetic language elevates the narrative but cannot fully mask structural schematicity.</comment>
