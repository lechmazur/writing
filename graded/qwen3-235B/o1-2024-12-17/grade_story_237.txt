<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits (psychic, genealogist, "proudly humble") are stated but not dramatized through action; motivation (hushing heartbreak) drives narrative but lacks visceral emotional grounding; connection between chipped dice and her actions feels symbolic rather than practically integrated into decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a circular arc between imprisonment and imagined escape, but pacing feels compressed; cause-effect relationships (e.g., diary discovery leading to capture) lack intermediate steps; ending resolution is poetic but undermines tension by implying hope without concrete action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid atmosphere merges claustrophobic brig with cosmic desolation through sensory details (humming corridors, flickering lights, shadows); "grave playfulness" manifests in juxtaposition of heartbreak with dice-as-fate imagery; setting enhances themes but lacks physical specificity (e.g., scent of rusted metal, weight of chains).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors ("alarm bells of heartbreak") and recurring motifs (dice, diaries) create thematic resonance; subtext about intergenerational trauma is hinted but underdeveloped; writing style mixes poetic imagery with vague exposition, creating uneven emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on abstract emotional descriptors ("quiet devastation") rather than visceral showing; some phrases ("whispers incantations") veer into purple prose; cosmic genealogy concept is original but occasionally overwhelmed by ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Story feels constrained by checklist-like integration of assigned elements; diaries/bullet trains and space pirates coexist uneasily; thematic momentum toward "hushing heartbreak" is clear but resolution feels abstract; style oscillates between mythic and mechanical.</comment>
