<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character remains overly abstract; motivations stated but not deeply explored. Eccentricity feels superficial. The whip and radio directives lack psychological integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Circular narrative lacks clear progression. Fragmented radio device feels arbitrary rather than structurally functional. Pacing lingers without building momentum or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vivid soil descriptions contrast with underdeveloped harvesting setting. The "giant's shoe" concept is imaginative but inconsistently rendered through sensory details beyond sight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors about sediment as history show promise, but thematic payoff is vague. The ending fails to coalesce ideas into memorable impact despite ambitious undertones.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Original elements (giant's shoe, radio frequencies) undercut by clich√©d "whispering artifact" trope. Some purple prose ("echoes of history embedded in every grain") and overly declarative emotional states.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely assembled. Length exposes underdeveloped arcs. The story's contemplative tone lacks visceral resonance, feeling more like a concept sketch than complete narrative.</comment>
