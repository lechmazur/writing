<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Empathic traits are mentioned but underdemonstrated; actions tie to motivation yet lack psychological nuance; "drowsy enthusiasm" remains a superficial descriptor rather than shaping decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marrow-weak cause-effect between fragmented clues and plot resolution; pacing balances poetic contemplation against narrative inertia but struggles to sustain tension within confinement.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cramped, decaying space hideout vividly contrasts with ethereal themes; sensory details (dust, flicker, echo) deepen desolation while subtly mirroring the protagonist's fractured psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbolism (marionette/reassembly) carries emotional weight; cosmic heartbeat climax transcends abstraction to evoke transcendence; subtext about fractured minds/unity feels urgent yet delicate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in merging Buddhist-inspired wisdom with sci-fi salvage yard; occasionally strains under florid phrasing ("astute fusion," "cosmic heartbeat"); marionette ritual borders on familiar mysticism tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Accumulated elements cohere more through poetic linkage than structural necessity; brevity forces abstraction over immersion; leaves intellectual residue without visceral narrative punch.</comment>
