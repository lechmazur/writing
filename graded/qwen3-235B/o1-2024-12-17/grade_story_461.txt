<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's sardonic tone and generational conflict are clear but lack nuanced emotional evolution; motivation to heal old wounds is explicit but not deeply interrogated beyond surface reconciliation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot momentum relies on repetitive internal monologue; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic coherence, with insufficient escalation of stakes or consequences for failed attempts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich with sensory details (candlelight, whispered memories) but the witch's study/childhood bedroom duality remains underexploited as a metaphor for entrapment versus liberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong integration of heartbeat motif with pendant's pulse creates resonant symbolism; subtext about reconciling lineage through meditative surrender elevates the narrative beyond literal ghost-taming.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery often feels like polished genre tropes (ghostly comfort, glowing pendants) rather than fresh metaphors; emotional shifts lean on direct statements rather than layered subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent synthesis of required elements with thematic thread about ancestral reconciliation, but lacks bold reimagining of how those elements interact within the fantasy framework.</comment>
