<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped. The assassin's calmness and humor contrast with lethal actions but lack emotional depth or evolution. Motivation remains vague, surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear progression. The butterfly-pattern method feels arbitrarily imposed, and the ending lacks resolution. Pacing drags due to excessive abstract description over action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting offers vivid but superficial details (lanterns, marbles). Atmosphere blends suspense and whimsy but lacks cohesion; tone shifts disrupt immersion in the palace’s cultural specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (prophecy, petals) hint at subtext but remain underexplored. Prose is stylistically ornate without sufficient emotional payoff or thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd phrases ("whispers of longing") and inconsistent tone. Overuse of "figuratively literal" phrasing feels forced; lacks organic character nuance or innovative structure.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Story lacks narrative cohesion. Elements feel compartmentalized rather than interwoven, and the brevity exacerbates structural flaws. No lasting thematic resonance.</comment>
