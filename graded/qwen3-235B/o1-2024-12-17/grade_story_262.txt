<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character defined by traits rather than actions; motivations remain abstract, not rooted in specific behavior or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Chronology ambiguous; lacks structural progression—more a series of poetic images than a narrative with cause/effect or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush but surface-level; setting’s historical and fantastical elements don’t cohesively interact with plot or character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor present but often opaque; emotional impact diluted by lack of narrative focus or character agency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Perilously close to pastiche; clichéd descriptors, inconsistent tone between mystical and grounded elements, and predictable thematic beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Elements included but not integrated; feels like a collage of isolated ideas rather than a unified, purposeful story.</comment>
