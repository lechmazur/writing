<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's traits lack depth; transformation from aimless to determined feels abrupt. Motivations (preserving recipes via hopscotch patterns) lack psychological nuance. Internal logic of linking factual imagination to archaic recipe decoding remains unconvincing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has circularity but lacks causal momentumâ€”the hopscotch board's relevance to culinary preservation is unexplained. Pacing sags under excessive atmospheric description at expense of narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich but sensorially incomplete (herbs/spices underdescribed). The snowflake motif creates eerie tone, yet setting functions more as backdrop than active force shaping character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Literary devices (snowflake metaphor, handkerchief symbolism) are present but surface-level. Ending's emotional resonance is diluted by stated emotions rather than visceral demonstration of cultural loss.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids common tropes by pairing hopscotch with culinary archiving, yet overreliance on flowery abstraction (e.g., "seeds of vigilance") and predictable melancholy-indigenous-wisdom framing weakens originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved but feels assembled to brief rather than organically developed. Strong opening/closing lines can't compensate for underexplored conceptual connections between key elements.</comment>
