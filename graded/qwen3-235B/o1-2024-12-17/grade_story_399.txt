<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is surface-level; motivation to heal from trauma is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced actions; internal conflict resolved too neatly.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc within constraints, but pacing feels slightly rushed; stargazing timeframe and mandala ritual connections lack layered development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (celestial glow, trembling scroll) enhance mystical atmosphere; setting supports theme but lacks deeper integration with trauma concept.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Use of symbolism (mandala, scroll) is effective but occasionally undercut by over-explanation; ending provides resolution but lacks lingering emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some poetic phrasing competes with overused descriptors ("luminous," "somber"); trauma exploration borders on clich√©; shifts between lyrical and mechanical tone.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent whole but lack transcendent interplay; theme of trauma-as-transformation hinted at rather than dissected; pacing uneven.</comment>
