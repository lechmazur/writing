<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character traits are stated more than shown; "practical" bard is inconsistently demonstrated, motivation feels generic despite surface-longing connection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable arc with clear cause-effect but rushes key moments (e.g., riddle-solving). Resolves neatly but lacks narrative tension beyond surface progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk atmosphere is vividly described (gears, steam, pipes) but world-building lacks emotional integration—settings remain backdrops rather than extensions of character/theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Surface-level emotional beats without subtext; instrument-as-harmonic-key moment shows potential but lacks deeper symbolic resonance or thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Leans on genre tropes (hidden libraries, guardian quests) with steampunk twist, but "precisely imperfect" instrument and screw-as-key add ingenuity; prose avoids overt clichés but skims thematic depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but predictably; no single aspect transcends genre conventions to create enduring impact. Style prioritizes clarity over stylistic innovation.</comment>
