<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's fractured psyche is evident but motivations lack consistent grounding; his math struggles weakly influence actions beyond occasional references. Fragmentation as both trait and plot device inconsistently shapes decisions. Distinctive voice diluted by overly poetic narration that obscures psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure mirrors theme but sacrifices cohesion; the leap from decoding to athletic experimentation feels forced despite thematic ties. Ending's thunder serves as a resolution but transitions lack logical buildup. Pacing falters under dense descriptions that overshadow plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Post-human treehouse library evokes haunting desolation through creaking floors, static sparks, and dust imagery. Setting's decay parallels character's psyche. Some inconsistencies in timeframe implications (e.g., how post-human era coexists with physical artifacts) but atmosphere remains immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythmic leaps as metaphor for redemption are poignant. Subtext of fractured identity seeking wholeness enriches narrative, yet emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction. Writing style balances lyricism with narrative urgency, though occasional opacity impedes deeper engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of dream theft and post-human melancholy avoids formulaic tropes. Some clich√©d phrases ("echoes of stolen aspirations") and sporadic purple prose. Mathematical struggle feels imposed rather than organic, but fragmented structure and sport-as-metaphor demonstrate ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively into atmospheric narrative, though the sport element feels underdeveloped. Brief length amplifies isolation theme rather than constraining it. Lingering reflection on human connection vs. fragmentation succeeds despite occasional narrative vagueness.</comment>
