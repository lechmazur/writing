<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's hardheadedness and broken state shape his actions, but emotional depth feels surface-level despite his final choice. Inner conflict lacks nuanced progression through the 500 words.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc from pursuit to resolution, but pacing feels unevenâ€”some transitions between introspection and action lack smooth connective tissue necessary for a tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cold, fragile atmosphere masterfully mirrors character's psyche through sensory details (crunching snow, melting sculptures) and supports thematic concerns about transience and corruption.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (ice statues, shadows) and thematic resonance (power vs. harmony) create emotional impact. Lyric prose enhances, with subtext about healing through surrender rather than dominance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overused phrases ("whispering shadows") and repetitive descriptors (three mentions of "demure audacity") suggest formulaic impulses. Tension between poetic language and human authenticity remains unresolved.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through strong core concept, despite brief moments of dissonance. Ends with emotionally satisfying thematic resolution that invites reflection on power and personal integrity.</comment>
