<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's "strictly casual" trait conflicts with deep commitment to forbidden knowledge; motivations are clear but underdeveloped. The chopstick wrapper's significance drives action but reveals little about his core self beyond curiosity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot arc exists but feels compressed; transitions between workshop and carnival booth lack nuance. Flashbacks complicate pacing, while cause-effect logic holds. The ending's thematic loop about sacrifice is present but shallow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Eerie carnival details (shattered glass, rusted toys) and mystical workshop imagery create strong atmosphere, but "tapestry of lost legends" remains vague. Sensory details enrich setting but inconsistently tie to metaphysical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., knowledge as gilded tomes) are evocative but occasionally overstated. The ending's tension between transformation and sacrifice resonates, though emotional depth feels filtered through abstraction rather than visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in juxtaposing mundane chopsticks with mystical carnival; some phrases ("whispers of ancient secrets") lean clich√©. Tone shifts are purposeful, but overly ornate descriptions occasionally obscure meaning. Subtext about costs of obsession is present but under-explored.</comment>
