<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth or inner conflict despite consistent actions; motivation remains abstract rather than visceral, functioning more as thematic conduit than fully realized person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric vignette rather than structured narrative; cause-effect logic between cosmic observations and character influence is implied but not demonstrated, undermining narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion through incense-smoke atmosphere and tactile descriptions of petals, but setting specifics (ancient Japanese castle reimagining) feel decorative rather than integral to thematic momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor and symbolic resonance between celestial patterns and fragile flora creates memorable subtext; however, emotional impact remains intellectual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but leans on lush prose that occasionally veers into self-conscious poeticism; metaphors remain fresh while tonal consistency wavers between mystical allegory and grounded melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion achieved through persistent motif repetition, though tight word limit leaves many elements (ghosts, art students) feeling underexplored as narrative devices rather than purposeful brevity.</comment>
