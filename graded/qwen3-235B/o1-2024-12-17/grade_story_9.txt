<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s sarcasm and panic are distinct, but inner conflict between cynicism and hope lacks depth. Motivation is clear but psychological complexity is underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc of desperation to hope, but pacing is uneven. The resolution (seed revelation) feels impactful but rushed within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid, unsettling atmosphere with neon desert and saloon details. Setting directly mirrors themes of consumerism vs. ecological collapse, sensory immersion strong.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (puzzle box as stewardship, seed as hope) resonate. Ending blends irony and optimism, but subtext about collective responsibility feels slightly underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but leans on “seed of hope” trope. Language occasionally florid (“molten sarcasm”), but tone and imagery feel authorially distinct.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of elements with thematic weight, though some narrative edges are ragged. Lingering questions about the world’s lore and character’s past undermine completeness.</comment>
