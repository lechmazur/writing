<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's "eagerly unwilling" trait inconsistently applied; storm-chasing past poorly connected to monastery setting; restoration motivation feels imposed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows logical arc but struggles with tight word limits - decoding mechanics feel rushed, cause/effect connections between tapestry and carousel restoration lack gradual buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Contrasting desert/monastery settings underdeveloped; sensory details present but generic; atmosphere doesn't fully support nostalgic innovation theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (storms/restoration) functional but not fresh; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks emotional punch; showing dominates over telling without sufficient depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Predictable contrasts (desert/monastery, restlessness/tranquility); overuse of "nostalgic innovation"; contrived character conflict; atmospheric elements feel template-driven.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Juxtapositions (tempest/solitude, decay/restoration) conceptually sound but execution lacks cohesion; thematic elements check boxes without resonant integration.</comment>
