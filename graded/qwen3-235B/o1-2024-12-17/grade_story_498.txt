<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but under-explores the "nervous kingpin" duality; internal conflict between past authority and current vulnerability remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven; the detour feels tangential rather than driving plot. Resolution is coherent but underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (frost, weathered stone) evoke midwinter bleakness effectively, but the enclave’s xenophobia lacks visceral cultural specificity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Formulaic phrases (“tyranny of indifference”) and predictable overcoming-hostility arc suggest AI-influenced writing; lacks subversive depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain narratively; the detour and monument feel contrived rather than organically integrated.</comment>
