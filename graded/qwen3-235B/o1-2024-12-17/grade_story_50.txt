<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character’s internal conflict is implied but remains abstract; motivations shift abruptly without sufficient psychological depth. Voice lacks distinctiveness, blending poetic abstraction with emotional vagueness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a minimal arc but lacks causal momentum—events occur impressionistically rather than cohesively. Pacing is uneven, with critical decisions feeling unearned or disjointed within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly surreal, with effective sensory immersion (crystalline reflections, resonant hums), but atmospheric elements (monarch’s migration, piano echoes) feel thematically unanchored rather than integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rich imagery and metaphor hint at themes of faith and transformation, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract phrasing. Ending achieves poetic closure but lacks narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Originality is undercut by clichéd spiritual motifs and repetitive descriptors (“capriciously consistent,” “alone intimacy”). The piano-decoding conceit feels artificial, suggesting formulaic construction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by forced integration of elements (e.g., piano echoes). The brief format highlights gaps in character nuance but allows atmospheric richness to linger as a vague impression.</comment>
