<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on mystical tropes ("hidden realms," "braille-like bumps whispering secrets") without subversion; prose leans into vague, flowery phrasing that weakens authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elements are loosely interconnected but lack cohesive synthesis; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with underexplored thematic potential.</comment>
