<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia shapes her reactions but her motivation to study human behaviors lacks sufficient narrative demonstration; her "boldness" feels underexplored despite key moments of vulnerability and resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses through episodic interactions with minimal cause-effect cohesion; tremor and stranger’s intervention feel disconnected from Elara’s central study-of-jams premise, weakening narrative arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (lavender steam, flickering candles, claustrophobic stone) create an immersive, dreamlike atmosphere, though the floating rock’s physics remain unexplained, slightly marring cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery and thematic parallels (secrets in preserves, healing via shared rituals) add depth, but emotional stakes are diluted by overly ornate phrasing; the ending’s "quietly bold" resolve feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some elements (floating tea house, stranger’s psychic touch) lean on fantastical tropes without subversion; jams-as-storytelling-device is inventive but underutilized, while excessive adjectives occasionally border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story incorporates all assigned elements, yet several feel contrived (floating rock’s relevance, Alvyn’s mystique); concept-driven construction prioritizes checklist completion over organic thematic unity.</comment>
