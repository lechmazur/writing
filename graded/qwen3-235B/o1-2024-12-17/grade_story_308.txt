<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strength: The bashful executioner’s dual nature (shyness vs. ferocity) is conceptually present, but underexplored; his motivation to preserve tradition is clear but lacks emotional depth through his interactions. The keychain’s symbolic value is stated rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: The festival timeline creates urgency; the rehearsal arc shows progression. Weakness: Pacing feels uneven—backstory about family dance traditions interrupts momentum, and the resolution feels abrupt despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Festival atmosphere and floating studio are vividly rendered with sensory details (lanterns, music, waves). Weakness: The oceanic setting’s connection to “soothing tides” is underutilized as an active narrative force, leaning more on imagery than thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: Metaphors blending dance/yoga and tradition/serenity are evocative. Weakness: Emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on descriptive abstraction (“benign ferocity,” “kinship”) rather than concrete, character-driven subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weakness: Phrases like “culminating ceremony” and “living heritage” border on cliché; some sensory details (glowing lanterns) are generic. Strength: The core concept of merging executioner lineage with cultural preservation offers ingenuity, though tone shifts lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strength: Conceptual cohesion around legacy and transformation is apparent. Weakness: The short length leaves underdeveloped threads (e.g., festival’s role, executioner’s societal position), and the resolution leans on symbolism over narrative payoff.</comment>
