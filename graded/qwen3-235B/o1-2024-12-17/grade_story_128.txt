<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Closely tied to plot, but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel abstract rather than lived, and the character's "voice" remains indistinct despite poetic descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually linear progression, but strained by compressed form—resolution feels abrupt, and the interplay between fading photograph and recipe lacks sufficient causal logic to sustain a fully cohesive arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich visual texture (e.g., "whispers of centuries") but inconsistent tonal grounding—blending Egyptian motifs with modern references like "jumbled TV subtitles" undermines atmospheric unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some evocative imagery (e.g., "shimmering liquid flickering like starlight") and thematic hints about memory/storytelling, but emotional resonance remains superficial, leaning on poetic vagueness rather than earned impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occasional fresh metaphors (recipe as "blueprint for unseen dimensions") compete with clichéd phrasing ("weight of centuries") and tonal whiplash between mythic grandeur and anachronistic modernity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively on a plot level but lack thematic synergy; the brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful, with underexplored ideas about storytelling’s power.</comment>
