<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Weaknesses in inconsistent motivation alignment; character's 'elegantly clumsy' trait occasionally feels superficial rather than integrated into deeper behavior patterns. Strength lies in tying his ghost perception to professional/everyday contexts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Promising cyclical structure undermined by compressed pacing; pivotal revelation about the flower crown feels under-prepared despite satisfying thematic symmetry. Resolution maintains coherence within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong sensory atmosphere in sand laboratory and haunted spaces, but world logic questions remain unaddressed (e.g., function of preservation lab). Atmospheric elements outpace world-building fundamentals.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant theme of release through acceptance, enhanced by evocative metaphors like "sand on the wind." Occasional sentimental risk counterbalanced by effective showing in final scenes with ghost's silent tears.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique combinations (technical profession with supernatural sensitivity), though some phrases trend toward poetic abstraction. Emotional nuance more developed than typical AI-generated arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Achieves narrative cohesion through recurring motifs despite element density. Leaves lingering emotional imprint through dual redemption arc rather than plot complexity. Structural compromises evident under extreme brevity constraints.</comment>
