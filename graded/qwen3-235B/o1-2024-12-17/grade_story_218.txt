<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie, cohesive atmosphere with vivid sensory details; setting meaningfully reflects psychological states.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated effectively; brevity works but sacrifices deeper character transformation; leaves mild impression without profound lingering impact.</comment>
