<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and meticulous messiness are superficial traits; motivations for non-violence lack depth; actions feel predetermined rather than organically arising from inner conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed—key moments (attic confession, spectral resolution) lack emotional or logistical buildup; cause/effect connections are present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Neon-lit city and haunted attic offer atmospheric potential, but sensory details are vague or reused clichés; "empty abundance" tone is inconsistently rendered.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors and theme of non-violence provide thematic cohesion, but emotional impact is dulled by abstract, tell-don’t-show writing; imagery lacks freshness to truly linger.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Relies heavily on tropes (haunted attic, drunken confessions) with minimal subversion; writing avoids purple prose but leans on predictable descriptors and slightly artificial-feeling phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly present but often functional rather than vital; some creative interplay (poetry vs. chaos) exists, but brief length exacerbates the sense of checklist-driven construction.</comment>
