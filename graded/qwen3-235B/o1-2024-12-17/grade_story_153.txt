<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Juniper's motivation is clear, but their personality remains sketchy; "detached devotion" feels imposed rather than organically revealed through actions or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot achieves basic completeness but feels rushed; Juniper's transformation lacks sufficient emotional weight or narrative groundwork due to constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid in moments (e.g., flickering headlamp), but the mole people and underground city lack depth; "gifted burdens" concept isn't fully leveraged.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of collective immortality and legacy resonate; effective symbolism with the headlamp, though emotional resonance is uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some originality in blending sci-fi with mythic imagery, but the "lone seeker" trope and overly ornate prose detract; metaphors feel partially generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack deeper integration; the storyâ€™s ambition outpaces its tight structure, leaving ideas underexplored.</comment>
