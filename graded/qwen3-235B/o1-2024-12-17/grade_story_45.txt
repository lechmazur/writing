<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by vague guilt and abstract actions, with minimal interiority or distinct voice; motivation implied through symbolic gestures but lacks psychological depth</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts a circular arc but pacing is uneven; abrupt transitions between museum, road trip, and temple; climax relies on vague mystical causality rather than tight structural payoff</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Sets up haunting visuals (ice violin, floating museum, crumbling temple) but underdevelops sensory details beyond sight; atmospheric tone feels more decorative than thematically resonant</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Uses metaphors like "ice and secrecy" and "seeds of exotic plants" for thematic weight, but emotional beats remain stated rather than embodied; ending lacks narrative or philosophical closure</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Contains intriguing elements (floating museum, ice violin) but execution leans on ornate abstraction and vague mystical tropes; emotional resolution feels prescribed rather than earned</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements function individually but cohesiveness is strained by abstract plotting; ambitious theme of guilt-to-renewal lacks concrete emotional anchoring; lingers more as ambiance than impact</comment>
