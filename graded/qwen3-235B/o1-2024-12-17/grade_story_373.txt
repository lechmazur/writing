<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic, with underdeveloped psychology and motivation; lacks emotional depth or nuanced reactions despite intriguing premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot adheres to ritualistic arc but feels compressed and episodic; pacing prioritizes poetic imagery over clear cause-effect logic within constrained word count.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated; forced connections (motels) and lack of human-scale stakes prevent cohesive literary distinction.</comment>
