<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is present but surface-level; motivations around immortality are clear but lack deeper psychological nuance or transformation beyond a binary choice to "safeguard" knowledge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but compressed; the judge’s verdict framing device feels loosely connected to the alchemist’s arc, with key emotional beats (e.g., moral reckoning) underdeveloped within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (floating marketplace, creaking balloons) but underutilizes the setting to deepen thematic tension; the "technically wild" design feels decorative rather than integral to the character’s dilemma.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Emotional impact is modest; while the moral choice about immortality introduces tension, subtext is limited, and metaphors (scale, scuffs) are functional rather than evocative. The ending resolves too neatly for a "cursed" theme.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on ornate descriptions (“whispering crystals,” “patterned balloons”) that occasionally border on formulaic. The twist—concealing the blood ritual—is somewhat fresh, though execution lacks tonal complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but lack synergy; the judge’s hush and forest-trail mapping feel extrinsic to the central dilemma. The story is serviceable but lacks audacity or lingering resonance to justify premium placement.</comment>
