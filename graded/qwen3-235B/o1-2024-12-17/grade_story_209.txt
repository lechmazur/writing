<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation linked to guilt and self-forgiveness is clear but lacks emotional depth; his 'despairing cheer' voice feels underdeveloped, though the antique hairbrush ties effectively to his history. Motivation aligns with actions but needs more tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot structure is compromised by tight word constraints: transitions between hospital memory, mapping railways, and catharsis feel abrupt. The echo-measurement gimmick drives climax but lacks setup. Resolution exists but feels compressed rather than cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Radio wave garden and water tower offer vivid, surreal imagery but underutilize sensory details beyond sound. Atmospheric tension between technology and decay is strong, though emotional resonance remains surface-level. Despairing cheer tone is inconsistently maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mixes overwrought metaphors ('short-circuit emotions') with effective symbolism (hairbrush). Ending lacks payoff; themes of honesty/redemption feel trite. Writing style alternates between poetic and ponderous, often telling rather than showing. Central conflict lacks urgency despite lyrical descriptions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Contains AI-like patterns: repetitive descriptors ('despairing cheer'), generalized sorrow without nuance. Uses 'haunted past' trope without subversion. Some fresh details (static-conducting tower) but undercut by overly formal phrasing and predictable emotional arcs. Lacks distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements forced into symbolic roles without full integration. Short form hinders emotional investment. Attempts layered themes but execution lacks precision. Conceptually ambitious but misses publishable polish. Lingering impression is vague melancholy, not profound insight.</comment>
