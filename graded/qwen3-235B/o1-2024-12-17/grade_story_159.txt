<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits and actions align but lack psychological nuance; motivation is clear but underdeveloped beyond archetypal rebellion against betrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progression follows labyrinth exploration, but truncated arc and rushed resolution undermine thematic payoff. Logical cause-effect exists but feels mechanistic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sandstone labyrinth provides rich atmosphere with evocative visuals (floating lanterns, shifting kaleidoscope light), but emotional resonance between setting and themes remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphor use (kaleidoscope as shifting perspectives) and thematic heft around betrayal's duality, though ending's heavy-handed forgiveness message weakens subtextual complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasionally flowery, redundant phrasing ("weather-beaten kaleidoscope" overused; "earnestly frivolous" repeated verbatim). Metaphors like dancing shapes contain promise but lack sustained innovation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements generally cohere, though confetti-coded proposals and wedding motif feel shoehorned. Tight word count enhances atmospheric concision but restricts emotional dimensionality.</comment>
