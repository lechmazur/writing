<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. The 'rationally rebellious' attribute lacks concrete behavioral manifestation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is functional but lacks narrative tension. Pacing unevenly handles exposition and resolution within constraints; thematic arc feels imposed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid visual elements present but some assigned components (e.g., 'cheerful gloom') underutilized. Sensory details unevenly integrated with emotional/plot development.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambient symbolism and lyrical prose create emotional echoes, but themes are occasionally heavy-handed. Strong imagery compensates for occasionally schematic character/plot relationship.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Phrases like 'cheerful gloom' show invention, but overreliance on poetic abstraction risks obscuring concrete human nuance. Some elements feel like checklist fulfillment rather than organic choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Solid cohesion despite numerous constraints, but element integration varies. Strongest when exploring cultural preservation through atmospheric symbolism; weaker in character/plot execution.</comment>
