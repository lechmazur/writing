<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (personal tragedy) is clear and consistently drives actions, with distinct voice in his obsessive methods. However, sardonic glee feels under-explored beyond surface descriptions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from investigation to resolution but suffers from compressed pacing. Connections between evidence (shipments, seals, peacock patterns) feel contrived in places, and the climactic demonstration lacks sufficient setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines industrial (fluorescent lights) and natural (orchard memories) elements effectively, with vivid sensory details. However, the paper airplane test facility's logic and conspiracy ties remain underdeveloped and inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Utilizes symbolism (peacock eyes as hidden codes, letter seal as familial legacy) effectively. Ending delivers thematic payoff (vigilance overcoming grief). Dialogue absent, but subtext in actions and objects sustains tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but contains overwrought details (peacock-eye decryption). Emotion shown through actions (stamp comparisons), not just narration. Tone remains consistent, though some metaphors feel strained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements (letter seal, orchard trauma, paper planes) cohere into a functional conspiracy narrative. Style is purposeful but occasionally ornate. Leaves questions about broader implications of smuggling, though depth is limited.</comment>
