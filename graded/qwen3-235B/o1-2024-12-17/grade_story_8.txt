<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (wed logic/madness) is clear, but lacks emotional depth; actions align with traits but feel symbolic rather than psychologically grounded. 'Dazed' aspect remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Loose structure exists but lacks traditional arc; beginning/end connection (chalking lectures) feels underdeveloped within word limit. Concept drives plot more than character agency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (rustling daisies, marble statues) and metaphorical setting enhance theme, though sound garden's musical elements remain underutilized beyond ambiance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (cosmic dance, chalked vines) create resonance, but over-reliance on adjectival phrases weakens emotional impact. Theme coherence fluctuates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Some original imagery undercut by repetitive abstractions ("benign ferocity," "empirically rebellious") that feel formulaic rather than organic to character/thought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack visceral emotional engagement; story feels more like poetic sketch than fully realized narrative.</comment>
