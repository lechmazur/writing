<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's transformation feels underdeveloped despite poetic introspection; motivations are hinted at but lack concrete behavioral anchors to fully convince.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing uneven: tension introduced but resolved too abruptly within constraints, though the spider-web motif provides minimal narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid's grandeur contrasts effectively with emotional intimacy, but excessive architectural description occasionally distracts from human elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mixed success in showing vs. telling; striking metaphors (dawn-cradling, cosmic breeze) elevate thematic resonance but occasionally verge on abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps (original setting, emotional nuance) but occasionally indulges in self-consciously "literary" phrasing that feels performative rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Element integration mostly coherent but occasionally mechanical; the asteroid setting feels like set-dressing rather than narrative necessity, weakening overall cohesion.</comment>
