<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is abstractly poetic but lacks psychological depth; actions align with goals but humanizing flaws or growth are absent, reducing emotional engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot orbits a central quest but lacks forward momentum—descriptive stasis outweighs narrative progression; resolution feels symbolic rather than earned through climactic tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized through surreal juxtapositions (apple trees/concrete rubble) and mythic decay, though sensory immersion leans heavily on visual cues, neglecting other senses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (e.g., orchard as dying Eden) and haunting imagery elevate the prose, but emotional impact is muted by diffuse tension and a fragmented focus on themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending post-apocalyptic mysticism with bureaucratic decay, though some phrases ("whispers of lost dreams") border on cliché; overall tone avoids formulaic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a haunting vignette, but the story's brevity constrains thematic payoff; style is distinct yet occasionally obscures narrative clarity.</comment>
