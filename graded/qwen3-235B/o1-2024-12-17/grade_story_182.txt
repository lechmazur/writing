<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Characterization relies on abstract descriptors over concrete motivations; reactions to spoon and chaos lack emotional depth; voice remains stylistically uniform without distinct inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot follows dreamlike logic but lacks clear stakes or agency; structure leans on set-piece imagery over cause/effect; abrupt transitions between elements (murals, projector, chamber) undermine cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details (dust, chipping paint) and synesthetic descriptions; magnetic mountain and flickering projector create a haunting, liminal world that supports thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but leans on lyrical abstraction as a crutch; some phrases ("frolicsome regret") feel self-consciously clever; metaphors are evocative but occasionally undercut by overly dense prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>High stylization creates lingering atmosphere but obscures narrative urgency; elements assembled with thematic ambition but uneven execution; ends with emotional ambiguity rather than transcendent impact.</comment>
