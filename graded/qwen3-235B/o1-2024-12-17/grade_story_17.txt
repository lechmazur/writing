<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are clear, with consistent actions supporting his internal conflict. However, internal depth remains surface, and "atypically typical" overcoat lacks connection to personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing is taut but occasionally rushed (e.g., sudden crone encounter). The arc from exploitation to redemption is coherent, though cause/effect logic for chamber's power feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mood is effectively eerie (graveyard, chamber), but sensory details lean on predictable tropes (candle wax, herbs). Morning walks establish rhythm but lack atmospheric integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Symbols (bowl, runes) convey theme of redemption. Subtext about exploiting grief for profit enriches narrative, and the ending's shift to honoring legacies feels earned but lacks visceral emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on redemption arc conventions. Chipped bowl subverts expectations by actively absorbing guilt, though chamber's magic lacks logical foundation. Language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere around guilt and redemption, but some (e.g., "atypically typical") feel arbitrarily assigned. The brevity serves the arc but sacrifices resolution depth. Lingering resonance stems from ethical dilemmas.</comment>
