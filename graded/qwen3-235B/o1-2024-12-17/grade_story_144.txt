<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Weakness in inner conflict; motivation is clear but lacks personal stakes or psychological depth. No dialogue hinders distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mechanical arc forced into word limit; cause-effect between stew sharing and conflict resolution feels abrupt. Pacing uneven with underdeveloped emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere well-crafted through sensory details (steam, phantom laughter) but timeframe ("long-forgotten lullabies") remains abstract and inconsistently woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "cradle of hope" create thematic resonance. Ending lacks sharpness, though the concept's emotional undercurrents and cosmic symbolism are effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Combines unique elements but relies on food-as-unity trope without subversion. Sensory details occasionally veer into overwrought description rather than emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack synergistic depth. Brief length highlights forced integration of some assigned prompts.</comment>
