<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations vaguely tied to actions. Traits like "gentle" are stated, not demonstrated, and internal conflicts remain underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is present but minimally developed; cause-effect connections are occasionally murky, and the tight word limit strains narrative cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack tight integration; brevity undercuts thematic depth, though the story lingers conceptually.</comment>
