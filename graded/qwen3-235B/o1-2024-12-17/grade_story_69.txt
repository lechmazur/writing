<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character motivation remains abstract and intellectualized rather than dramatized; "uncertainty" manifests only in metaphysical abstractions rather than concrete choices or emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Raised by atmospheric cohesion but weakened by inconsistent chronology and abrupt transitions between wandering past and technical present; resolution feels decorative rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding creates eerie, layered tension between decay and possibility through tactile descriptions of machinery and holographic fragility; lacks deeper integration with character psychology.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Occasional striking imagery ("swirling geometric shapes that pulsed like fragile stars") elevates the narrative, but thematic assertions about chaos/harmony remain undercontextualized; ending lacks emotional gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Relies on algorithmic markers: excessive adverbial qualifiers ("lethargically"), redundant metaphors ("back-alley auditions"), and vague symbolic gestures; atmosphere feels constructed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Technically atmospheric but conceptually fragmented; many elements function as checklist items rather than organic narrative components; short-form compression highlights, rather than enhances, these limitations.</comment>
