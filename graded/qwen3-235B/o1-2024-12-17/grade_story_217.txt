<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks consistent alignment with actions; shared cuisine vow feels disconnected from her rebellious defiance, while the 'sadly joyful' trait remains underexplored despite emotional moments.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but thinly developed; the haunted house corridors serve as repetitive obstacles, and the resolution with red beans/rice lacks narrative causality despite symbolic intent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere excels through sensory details (dusty mirrors, carnival music), with 'ephemeral gloom' tone vividly entwined in the setting, though cuisine integration feels unrelated to the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotional symbolism (pocket knife as adaptation, final meal) delivers impact, but relies on telling over showing; themes of resilience and transformation are present but occasionally diluted by abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repeated phrases ("ephemeral gloom," "sadly joyful") and contrived emotional beats suggest formulaic tendencies; haunted house tropes persist without innovation, while the cuisine element feels artificially inserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly woven; the narrative's brevity restricts cohesion, with themes and objects feeling compartmentalized rather than organically interacting to create depth.</comment>
