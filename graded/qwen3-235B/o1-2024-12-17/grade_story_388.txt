<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable mythical arc with efficient pacing, but compressed word limit sacrifices nuanced progression; tonal peaks feel rushed despite strong thematic throughline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, almost overwrought sensory tapestries create an immersive atmosphere; settings amplify thematic resonance, though occasionally at the cost of emotional immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors counteract formulaic quest structure; tone occasionally borders on poetic excess but avoids overt clich√©s through specific botanical and musical details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Functional cohesion exists but relies on atmospheric compensation rather than narrative invention; elements are competently integrated without transcending their checklist origins.</comment>
