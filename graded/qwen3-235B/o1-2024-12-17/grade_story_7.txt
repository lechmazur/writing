<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; traits are symbolic rather than human, with motivations conveyed through abstract descriptions rather than meaningful actions or choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Purposeless progression through surreal imagery lacks causal logic; "plot" exists primarily as a sequence of visual impressions rather than coherent narrative development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ethereal setting built on excessive adjectives creates vague atmosphere; sensory details overwhelm function, with environment rarely influencing character decisions or plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on empty abstraction muffles emotional impact; literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) remain superficial without thematic throughline or narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Text drips with overwritten clich√©s ("cosmic gloom," "ethereal grit") and artificial solemnity; feels algorithmically generated through trope combinations without authorial voice or subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Story prioritizes atmospheric ornamentation over narrative cohesion; elements appear randomly inserted rather than organically integrated, leaving no lasting thematic impression.</comment>
