<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's sentience as both mechanic and empath lacks emotional depth beyond stated traits; motivations hinted at but not earned through action or internal conflict</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but feels rushed; cause-effect between elements (e.g., opera glasses â†’ mosaic) lacks gradual build-up; resolution feels abrupt despite clever throughline</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clever integration of elements overwhelms thematic cohesion; strong conceptual skeleton visible beneath occasionally suffocating descriptive layers</comment>
