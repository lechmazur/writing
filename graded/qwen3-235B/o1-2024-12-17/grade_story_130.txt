<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's traits are abstract and inconsistently manifested. Internal struggles lack nuanced motivation, reducing depth. Actions align with broad themes but not individualized psychology. Third-person poetic voice obscures distinct personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Non-linear structure privileges atmosphere over causality. Transformation feels abrupt despite attempts at thematic coherence. Pacing balances poetic reflection with narrative stasis, sacrificing plot momentum for abstraction. Beginning/end connection is thematic but underconstructed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Interstellar orchard imagery creates visual wonder but fails to integrate with character's psychological journey. Sensory details favor sight while neglecting other modalities. Tone oscillates between melancholy and optimism without deliberate contrast, weakening atmospheric immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of recurring symbols (nest, orchard) and metaphoric language deepens thematic exploration. Ending's epiphany feels earned but generalized. Literary devices elevate craft, though emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral. Central conflict between despair/hope is underdramatized yet clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original setting elements counterbalance formulaic "lost apprentice" archetype. Metaphors lean toward overused abstraction (cosmic illusions, reverse-engineering). Emotional nuance is hinted at but often filtered through conceptual language. Stylistic density occasionally crosses into ornate excess without sacrificing coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically but relies heavily on poetic resonance over narrative force. Assigned elements provide scaffolding rather than organic growth. Style prioritizes lyrical texture over clarity at times, yet leaves lingering meditative quality about growth through vulnerability. Doesn't fully transcend its constituent parts.</comment>
