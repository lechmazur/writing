<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character exists as poetic abstraction rather than fully realized person; motivations feel intellectually constructed rather than organically felt, with emotional states assigned rather than embodied through specific reactions</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mysterious progression undermines coherence; scenes connect thematically rather than causally, with pivotal actions feeling predetermined rather than earned, though the circular structure attempting to mirror bird patterns shows ambition within constraints</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with crystalline logic: salt mines' mineral decay complements digital decay theme; flickering light patterns create rhythmic pulse mirroring both computer data and hearts; atmospheric details generally precise but occasionally lapse into generalized "eeriness"</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (flickering data/bird formations) create resonance; ending achieves thematic synthesis but relies too heavily on direct statement over experiential revelation; tension between uncertainty and action remains underexplored despite surface consistency</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Uneven balance: crystalline stalactite imagery fresh, but "joyfully tragic" repeats rather than manifests; "counterpoint of hearts" introduced conceptually rather than dramatized; avoids major AI tells but exhibits occasional abstract vagueness masking emotional specifics</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements combine in mosaic rather than machine-like precision; atmospheric success contrasts with narrative ambiguity; thematic cohesion present but execution lacks distinction between poem and prose, leaving overall purpose uncertain</comment>
