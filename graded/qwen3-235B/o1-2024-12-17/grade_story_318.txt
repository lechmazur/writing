<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a vague arc from drifting to decision but lacks traditional cause-effect; the memory-translation action keeps narrative moving but feels repetitive rather than progressive; ending has thematic resonance but structural weaknesses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rich metaphysical metaphors create vivid imagery but over-reliance on abstract descriptors (shimmering, gloomy cheerfulness) mutes sensory specificity; the "architecture of the mind" and crystal library work conceptually but lack tangible physical details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical language and thematic echoes about memory and perseverance; lacks emotional immediacy despite lyrical passages; some literary devices feel decorative rather than integral; ending attempts character transformation that feels underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Premise has potential but execution leans on poetic abstraction rather than unique vision; metaphor layering shows intentionality but sometimes becomes forced or repetitive; emotional landscape relies too much on stated contrasts rather than demonstrated complexity; occasional purple prose weakens impact.</comment>
