<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character remains a static symbol; motivations are stated more than demonstrated through nuanced actions. Assigned attributes shape surface-level behaviors but lack psychological depth or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure; cyclical pacing suits thematic arc but weakens narrative momentum. Assigned action (rewriting diaries) drives progression, but closure feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned through cause-effect.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Starless night and whisper collection point create haunting sensory atmosphere. Setting details (lantern light, key ring jingles) effectively immerse, but "noble chaos" tone occasionally veers toward pretentious abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (crosswords as healing, keys as promises) offer intellectual resonance, but emotional impact is dulled by excessive abstraction. Central theme of reconciliation emerges clearly but without visceral subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases ("indefinitely absolute," "whisper collection point") and overly ornate syntax suggest formulaic patterns. Emotional beats rely on descriptive statements rather than subtle characterization or symbolic action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but sacrifices narrative specificity for thematic breadth. Length limitation exposes underdeveloped tensions, though atmospheric linger and symbolic density hint at deeper possibilities.</comment>
