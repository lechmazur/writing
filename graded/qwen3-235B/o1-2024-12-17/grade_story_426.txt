<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Adelina's secretive nature and aloofness are present but underdeveloped; her "forgotten prodigy" status is stated more than demonstrated through action or memory consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from rushed transitions between marathon training, the amusement park, and cryptid quests; pacing is uneven despite attempting a full arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Creative atmosphere with vivid carnival decay and spectral details, though the teapot's symbolism occasionally disrupts immersion with forced metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (e.g., fractures as potential) work, but the ending feels abrupt and thematically under-resolved despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by overwrought descriptors ("cryptids with herb-lore") and repetitive emotional cues; some elements (playlist hacking) strain plausibility.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unsettling tone and unique premise showcase creativity, but tighter integration of marathon training and emotional subtext would elevate cohesion.</comment>
