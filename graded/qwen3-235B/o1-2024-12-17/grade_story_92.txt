<question>1</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Character voice remains passive surface-level observer; motivations (wealth seeking, professional duty) inconsistently fleshed out against the surreal demands; reactions to supernatural elements feel underdeveloped despite first-person narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows haunted mansion tropes with underexplored cause-effect (why blood drive encounter leads to botanical dog-walking); pacing uneven—concludes abruptly after ledger reveal; tight word limit exposes underdeveloped resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, oppressive atmosphere built through sensory contradictions (gleaming tea vs. blood drive shadows); haunted mansion's sentient qualities (shifting portraits, theatrical floors) amplify psychological tension; time frame integration ("color bleeds") enhances disorientation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective symbolism in "tea as whispered vows," "black ledger lineage," and botanical darkness-dependent flora; ending lacks emotional payoff despite rich metaphors; theme of silent complicity hinted but thinly explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptors ("carefully careless," "labyrinthine grounds") border on cliché; sudden narrative skips (dog walker's seamless acceptance, blood drive setup) lack human nuance; atmospheric originality undermined by occasionally formulaic phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Element integration feels checklist-driven (blood drive, botanicals, haunted room) rather than organically fused; intriguing motifs remain superficial; promising central conflict underdeveloped; style over substance in places.</comment>
