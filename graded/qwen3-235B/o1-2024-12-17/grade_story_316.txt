<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's timidity contrasts with her bold quest goal but isn't fully integrated into decision-making; motivations are clear but emotionally underexplored beyond surface-level devotion to promises.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence with tight arc despite word constraints, though the connection between typing and achieving collective healing remains abstract; pacing occasionally stalls during atmospheric descriptions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting masterfully blends ancient and industrial decay with sensory details, though symbolic connection between marble/neon and the scoreboard feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery and metaphorical resonance (e.g., mosaic hum) elevate craft, but emotional impact is dulled by overreliance on poetic abstraction over concrete character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on ornate phrasing ("tarnished display with triumphant glow") that verges on decorative rather than revelatory; originality in blending arcade/scoreboard with ancient temple is strong.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements combine creatively, but thematic cohesion feels engineered rather than organic; brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of collective healing's mechanics or societal implications.</comment>
