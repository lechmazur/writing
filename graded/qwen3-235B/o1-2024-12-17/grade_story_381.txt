<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Necromancer's motivation exists but lacks emotional depth; his connection to old movies as a driving force feels underexplored and superficially tied to his actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression through the cave but struggles with condensed pacing; climax feels abrupt, weakening narrative payoff despite coherent structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crystalline cave’s sensory details create strong atmosphere, but "futuristic nostalgia" clashes unevenly—film references feel tacked onto tech elements rather than organically merged.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery (e.g., "luminescence that danced like phantoms") elevates the prose, but explicit emotional declarations ("yearning for revelations") hinder deeper subtext and thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While the baseball cap and cinematic nostalgia attempt originality, clichéd phrasing ("echoes of restless spirits") and predictable tropes (obsessed protagonist seeking redemption) undermine uniqueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story adheres to constraints but feels engineered to include elements rather than organically developed; the ending’s sudden declaration of "fate" lacks earned resonance.</comment>
