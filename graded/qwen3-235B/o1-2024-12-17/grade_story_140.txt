<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains abstract, motivation hinted but not deeply explored; traits shape actions superficially but lack nuanced backstory connecting duty to personal history or emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Predictable arc with uneven pacing—climax feels rushed despite poetic imagery; cause/effect between flashbacks and present actions lack concrete narrative stakes or tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambiguous timeframe weakens tension; setting is vividly rendered with sensory details but doesn't materially shape character choices or deepen thematic conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stirring imagery and metaphor, but emotional momentum hinges on stated feelings ("haunted," "fearless devotion") rather than subtext; ending feels pat, lacking lingering resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwrought descriptors ("hush of dawn’s second breath") and cosmic clichés sap originality; planetarium encounter feels inserted didactically rather than organically shaping character.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story hinges on prescribed elements but struggles to integrate them cohesively; tone shifts inconsistently between poetic yearning and narrative detachment.</comment>
