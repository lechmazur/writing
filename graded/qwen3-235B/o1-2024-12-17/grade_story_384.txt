<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Frantic cook lacks depth; motivation to expose illusions is vague and underexplored. Professional skills tie only superficially to plot actions, failing to create meaningful contradictions or insights about his role.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear progression but feels compressed. Beginning and end lack organic connection; cause-effect logic strained by leaps in "discovery" moments that prioritize poetic imagery over narrative cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Richly described but inconsistent. Seismic setting clashes with culinary training; sensory details overwhelm without clarifying why this location sustains centuries of dust or how it physically impacts the character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Attempts metaphorical layering (kitchen/seismic patterns) but relies too heavily on stated contrasts. Ending's "truth surfaced" feels hollow - lacks earned emotional weight or revelation tied specifically to character's perspective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by formulaic phrases ("swirling apparitions," "frenzied tranquility") and overwrought transitions between scenes. The cook-seismic connection shows potential but gets lost in excessive adjectives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Elements included but unevenly integrated. The required components create narrative friction rather than synergy; brevity feels restrictive, not strategic. Attempts depth but leaves most thematic threads poorly developed.</comment>
