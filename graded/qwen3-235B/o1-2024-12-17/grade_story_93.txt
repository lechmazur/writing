<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (sacred geometry obsession) drives plot, but lacks depth beyond frantic archetypal traits; reactions to calling cards and pirate radio feel narratively functional, not psychologically layered</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Crisis-to-elevator escape creates superficial momentum, but compressed word limit strains cause-effect logic; abrupt shifts between archive search, radio evasion, and farewell undermine coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Sparse sensory detail weakens atmosphere; "cosmic puzzle" and "drifting signals" hint at mystique but lack visceral environmental texture to ground labyrinthine/celestial themes</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Metaphors linking geometry to cosmic patterns suggest depth, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract declarations versus earned narrative revelations; unresolved farewell lacks thematic payoff</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Florid phrases ("daggers of urgency"), repetitive "unspoken bonds" references, and labyrinth-as-cosmic-metaphor border on algorithmic tropes; attempts at uniqueness feel strained rather than organic</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements awkwardly stacked rather than organically fused; elevating "pirate radio" and "calling cards" as central devices strains credibility, though cosmic-labyrinth conceit offers marginal thematic cohesion</comment>
