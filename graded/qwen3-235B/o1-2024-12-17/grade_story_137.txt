<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character remains an abstract vessel; motivations (language of the heart) are clear but lack psychological depth or tangible stakes to anchor their actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc (seeking answers via lace patterns), but pacing falters in places—resolution feels abrupt despite efforts to suggest cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory fragments (columns, gauzy fabrics), but the "temple in the clouds" lacks grounding in tangible logic, undermining immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Leverages metaphor/symbolism (tapestry, binder clip) skillfully, but abstract themes (healing, loss) overshadow emotional resonance; ending is poetic but under-earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Visionary approach avoids tropes but veers into purple prose; atmospheric details are potent yet sometimes dissonant, risking cliché through excessive abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements strain under the weight of metaphor; coherence hinges on poetic rhythm rather than narrative urgency, diluting the story's impact despite inventive conceits.</comment>
