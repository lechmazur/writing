<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's grief is symbolically conveyed but lacks nuanced depth beyond persistent sorrow; motivation to chronicle technology feels underexplored despite surface plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Linear progression with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing leans static; resolution of renewed purpose feels abrupt without deeper narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ambient details evoke mood but lack visceral specificity; setting's secrecy aligns with themes but shadows/bell imagery remain underdeployed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbols (bell, nightmares) carry thematic weight, but emotional resonance leans on abstraction rather than earned subtext; ending purposeful but unexceptional.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally relies on melancholic lyricism as a crutch; originality in framing grief as archival impulse is undercut by predictable tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements nominally cohere, but synthesis feels calculated rather than organic; brevity works for mood but limits character/thematic complexity.</comment>
