<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pacing uneven—lyrical descriptions contrast abrupt shifts; structure resolves logically but skirts superficiality in transitioning between mystery and solution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid contrasts between decay and "strange new power" immerse readers, yet post-oil setting feels underexplored, weakening thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but leans on familiar motifs (haunted palaces, coded patterns); prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction, diluting immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually rich but uneven execution—elements like the doll’s dress feel organic, while temporal shifts and the "oil extraction" framing lack narrative integration.</comment>
