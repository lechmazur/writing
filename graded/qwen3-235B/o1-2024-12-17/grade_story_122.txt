<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is present but underdeveloped; "patently frantic" is shown but not fully integrated into behavioral patterns or decision logic. The cyber-templar's collision course with reality lacks concrete psychological stakes beyond surface-level determination.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but strains under word constraints. The connection between storm confrontation and sky burial site remains superficial. Cause-effect between prism use and storm transformation is abrupt without sufficient mechanical or thematic scaffolding.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid atmospheric details create strong immersion, particularly in storm descriptions and burial site imagery. Sensory integration is lopsided toward visuals, missing opportunities with tactile sensations (electricity, wind force) or audio depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative passages exist but unevenly spaced. The final storm-defiance moment works well, though the central conflict's philosophical implications (nature vs. technology, ritual vs. progress) remain underdeveloped beneath stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Strong originality in concept blending (cybernetics + mysticism), but execution leans on storm imagery clich√©s and overly ornate phrasing ("euphoric agitation," "cosmic fury"). Prism-reflection mechanic feels conceptually thin despite vivid description.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Story achieves visual cohesion but struggles with tonal unity - mystical language sometimes clashes with cybernetic elements. The ending resolves the immediate conflict but leaves thematic questions (about safety, proving worth) underexplored for maximum impact.</comment>
