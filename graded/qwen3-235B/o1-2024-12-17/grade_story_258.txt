<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivation is stated but lacks visceral depth. Physical metaphysicality isn't fully integrated into psychology. "Jaded wonder" manifests unevenly without clear narrative consequences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed. Cause-and-effect is implied rather than dramatized. The orchard's curse resolution follows logically from the dance, but narrative arc lacks emotional peaks/troughs within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's strongest element: brine, groaning driftwood, electric storms, and trembling leaves create immersive synesthesia. Timeframe and setting work symbiotically but occasionally verge on mystical vagueness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (locksmith as keyholder of cultural memory) and symbolism (unlocking vs. dancing). The ending satisfies thematically but lacks lingering metaphysical heft. Conflict between erosion and preservation is clear but under-examined.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some phrases ("jaded wonder," "storm of secrets") feel troped. The yearbook annotations device is underdeveloped, bordering on gimmick. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally overwrought (e.g., "centuries of sorrow and hope in one blinding flash").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story feels conceptually ambitious but executionally uneven. Elements like the orchard and dance are strong, but narrative cohesion is strained by compressed abstraction. Leaves thematic questions but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
