<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Purely plot-driven; motivations lack psychological depth. The ranger's foolhardiness doesn't create meaningful conflict or inform choices beyond surface-level persistence. Actions don't demonstrate how "steadily creative" influences decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Meandering structure: repetitive descriptions outweigh dramatic progression. Storm transitions serve atmosphere better than plot logic. Resolution feels imposed rather than earned through cumulative narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Visually rich but emotionally inert setting. Snow globe physics never interrogated for thematic tension between containment and chaos. Frost motifs are decorative rather than structural.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Symbols (cup lid, tapes) have surface metaphorical value but lack subtextual resonance. Ending provides closure without earned emotional gravity. The "language of wind/waves" remains abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI signatures through distinctive cosmic metaphors, but occasionally leans on vague poetic abstraction ("symphonies of air and water") that risks obscuring genuine emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Coherence exists at surface level, but elemental integration feels checklist-driven rather than organically fused. The miniature world concept's potential for exploring control vs. surrender remains untapped.</comment>
