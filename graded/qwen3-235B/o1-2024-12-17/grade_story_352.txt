<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Poetic but lacks character depth beyond archetypal traits; motivations are clear but not fully explored, with actions only tangentially revealing inner complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose arc but lacks clear progression; the action of conserving musical traditions drives it, yet cause-effect relationships are obscured by lyrical abstraction and abrupt shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with sensory details, though some elements (e.g., "invisible ink") strain coherence; setting enhances tone but occasionally overwhelms narrative clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong literary devices and lyrical prose engage intellectually, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; themes of preservation and memory are compelling but underexplored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original concept execution avoids clich√©s, with fresh metaphors and a distinctive voice; minor issues with over-stylized prose in isolated passages.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive but occasionally prioritizes poetic imagery over narrative momentum; elements support the theme, though some (e.g., "leaf falling") seem disconnected.</comment>
