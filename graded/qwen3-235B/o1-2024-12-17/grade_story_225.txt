<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is conceptually consistent but lacks emotional texture; motivations are poetic but underdeveloped beyond symbolic functions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot has clear trajectory but feels compressed; connections between key moments (e.g., crew dynamics to climax) need stronger causal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lush sensory details effectively saturate the steampunk setting, though some descriptions verge on aesthetic overload without deep functional purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery and thematic resonance are strong, but overly declarative statements weaken subtext; emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction over earned nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blends inventiveness (e.g., underwater butterflies) with familiar motifs (loner seeker, hidden cure); metaphors often prioritized over psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole, but some choices (highlighter pen, Morse-coded "infection") strain plausibility to serve symbolism.</comment>
