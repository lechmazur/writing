<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fidgetiness manifests in physical actions but lacks psychological depth. Motivation to hold chaos at bay is stated but underexplored, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ritual progression follows a clear arc but feels rushed; pivotal moments (keys spinning, rift sealing) lack build-up, undermining narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lavender field’s sensory details evoke mood, but industrial ruins remain atmospheric backdrop rather than meaningful contrast. Starlight symbolism is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overuse of adverbs (“frantic lines,” “trembling faith”) and clichéd metaphors dilute impact. Chalkboard trope and chaos vs. order theme feel derivative despite minor inventive flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements are functional but unevenly integrated; lavender essence and starlight connections feel decorative rather than essential. Conceptual ambition outweighs thematic depth.</comment>
