<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's "loudly introverted" trait feels insufficiently woven into action or voice; motivation for seeking courage lacks visceral emotional grounding despite thematic hints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear quest arc but relies on repetitive environmental descriptions to simulate progression; resolution feels abstract rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The neon cathedralâ€™s vivid visuals create immersive atmosphere, but its connection to the "post-human storytelling" timeframe remains superficial; tone oscillates between mystical and overwritten.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism (cracked CD, light) elevates thematic resonance, though emotional impact is diluted by abstraction; ending leans too heavily on poetic vagueness over narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Striking imagery occasionally descends into decorative prose; metaphors like "crooked hope" feel conceptually rich but lack contextual innovation; overall voice risks becoming self-indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres around its assigned elements but often through checklist integration rather than organic synthesis; tone and pacing sustain interest despite structural predictability.</comment>
