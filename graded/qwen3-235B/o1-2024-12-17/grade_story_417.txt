<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Zealot's motivations and personality are distinct but secondary characters lack development; motivations align with actions but emotional layers remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect logic exists but abrupt shifts in crisis resolution (monster's retreat) weaken cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid but unevenly integrated—Victorian parlor/jungle contrast lacks thematic payoffs; sensory immersion is strong but inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability and unity resonate; atmospheric tension and symbolic objects add depth, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality hinges on surreal juxtapositions (e.g., bottle cap as relic); avoids clichés but occasionally veers into ornate phrasing without deepening subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but prioritized as aesthetic devices over narrative drivers; tone and thematic threads hint at depth without full realization.</comment>
