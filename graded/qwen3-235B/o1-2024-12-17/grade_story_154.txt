<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character's "strongly weak" nature feels repetitive rather than developed; motivations (tracking urban legends, social change) are stated, not demonstrated through meaningful choice or struggle; transformation upon touching ink pot lacks earned emotional weight; narration repeats psychological states rather than revealing them through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot relies on convenient discoveries (shimmering ink pot) and abrupt transitions (levitation, instant unity); limited room to establish cause-effect within word count; beginning/middle/end structure exists but feels mechanically imposed rather than organically connected; urban legends method doesn't influence plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setting provides visual motifs (charcoal etchings, recycled architecture) but lacks immersive sensory texture; Celtic reimagining feels superficial, disconnected from themes; "between games" timeframe has no discernible impact on mood or events; atmosphere prioritizes poetic abstraction over concrete, evocative details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emotional impact undermined by constant telling rather than showing ("jubilant despair," "strongly weak"); strands of courage concept has thematic potential but remains vague; ending's "fragile unity" feels contrived rather than earned; writing style over-relies on alliteration and abstract nouns; tension exists only at conceptual level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrases ("strongly weak," "jubilant despair") suggest formulaic pattern-recognition; generic fantasy elements (magic ink pot in Celtic village) without fresh subversion; uneven sensory detail (vivid visuals vs. absent other senses); emotional states declared rather than inferred; tone shifts between despair/hope lack nuance; metaphors feel like surface-level adornment rather than integral to narrative logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Numerous assigned elements function more as checklists than narrative drivers; style obscures clarity with excessive abstraction; word limit exposes forced exposition rather than creating deliberate brevity; conceptual theme about courage/social cohesion lacks specific textual embodiment; no lingering resonance beyond stated messages.</comment>
