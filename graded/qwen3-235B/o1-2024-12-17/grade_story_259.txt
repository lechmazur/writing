<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters function more as archetypes than fully realized individuals; motivations are stated but lack emotional depth despite alignment with traits. Distinct voice absent in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative has cohesion but lacks tension or arc; plot progression feels like checklist of set elements rather than organic momentum within strict word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (clanking limbs, vibrating canvases) create immersive atmosphere; "comforting unease" manifests through tactile contrasts between organic human action and synthetic environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (machines with "sparks of divinity") and symbolic objects (telescope bridging eras) add theoretical depth, but emotional impact remains muted; theme of legacy threads throughout but lacks visceral resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visionary premise undercut by occasionally ornate phrasing ("writhing cables and luminous monitors"); avoids genre clich√©s but leans on abstract descriptors rather than concrete emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition apparent but execution prioritizes atmospheric flourishes over narrative cohesion; structure feels dictated by required elements rather than organic storytelling choices.</comment>
