<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivations are partially realized but inner conflict lacks visceral nuance. "Guarded disclosures" drive action but social nature remains superficially portrayed through passive observation rather than active engagement.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is generally cohesive with satisfying resolution, but pacing stumbles during dance-to-puzzle transitions. The "synthesize" action drives progression logically though compressed cause-effect sequences strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends mystical and clinical elements effectively through symbols and mirrored rooms, but sensory details remain abstract (e.g., "peculiar symbols," "shifting walls"). Timeframe-dance connection establishes rhythm but underutilizes the setting's potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clever puzzle symbolism offers intellectual engagement, yet emotional impact remains muted. The theme of bridging mysticism/science emerges clearly, but heavy exposition in final paragraphs ("forging a bridge") undermines subtlety through overt telling rather than immersive showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unique fusion of exorcism rituals with empirical dance research avoids genre tropes. Some overused phrases ("antechamber revealed," "forbidden lore") surface, but the original concept of "dance as cryptographic key" demonstrates inventive recombination of elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements with minor forced connections (coy aggression feels tacked on). Short length amplifies narrative tension through compression rather than limitation. Leaves questions about postcard's mentor lore rather than delivering deep thematic resonance.</comment>
