<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mute attribute shapes visual determination but lacks emotional depth. Motivation to find hidden meanings drives plot but isn't meaningfully interrogated. Muteness primarily serves as narrative silence rather than influencing specific choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Assigned action (generate portal) clearly structures plot progression. Logical use of guide and comet guidance, but pacing uneven - atmospheric descriptions slow momentum while key plot mechanics remain underexplained. Beginning/end connection present but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shattered mirrors, flickering chandeliers) masterfully create haunting atmosphere. Snow and storm enhance mood, but opera house's decay doesn't meaningfully intersect with interdimensional concept. Setting used for texture over narrative function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("ghostly dancers") and cosmic imagery create memorable tone. Theme of escape receives surface-level treatment. Ending offers visual transformation but no emotional resolution. Strong style overshadows character depth or thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some original combinations undercut by clich√©d phrases ("tears from the heavens"). Tropes (haunted opera house, chosen one quest) remain unchallenged. Sensory details specific but occasionally overwrought. Voice distinctive yet occasionally veers into self-conscious lyricism rather than organic storytelling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function superficially but lack organic integration. Atmospheric strengths contrast with underdeveloped thematic and character dimensions. Prose style demonstrates mastery but length feels restrictive rather than purposeful. Ends on stylistic flourish without meaningful narrative payoff.</comment>
