<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Incomplete integration of character traits with action; motivation is hinted but lacks psychological complexity; cloth bag as symbolic object is underdeveloped; inconsistent application of "fiercely apathetic" attribute weakens characterization</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Static progression; meteor shower resolution appears arbitrarily connected to overcoming; circular structure lacks causal momentum; pacing oscillates between rushed internal shifts and leisurely descriptions</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Visually rich but atmospheric elements (waterfalls, incense) remain decorative rather than thematic; floating monastery's existential implications for the character's crisis remain unexplored; sensory details occasionally undercut emotional stakes through overelaboration</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (starbursts-as-hope) elevate craft but verge on clich√©; emotional impact diluted by explicit labeling of feelings rather than embodied expression; conclusion achieves thematic resonance but lacks narrative surprise</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reliance on archetypal redemption arcs; occasionally purple prose ("knowing naivety," "twisted cynicism"); inconsistent tone shifts between philosophical gravitas and poetic abstraction; character voice risks becoming indistinct under stylistic embellishment</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Technical competence evident but lacks transcendent quality; elements function as checklist fulfillment rather than organic components; stylistic polish cannot fully compensate for thematic shallowness; brief format reveals structural weaknesses</comment>
