<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lack of interiority and underdeveloped voice undermines motivation; character's actions inconsistently reveal depth beyond surface symbolism of bread paddle.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on passive progression; cause-effect between analyzing postcards and escape lacks logical scaffolding; abrupt transitions mask narrative gaps in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (gears, splintered paddle) establish baseline atmosphere but spacetime folds and island visions remain abstract; tone shifts feel unearned rather than intentional.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mechanical birds as emotional barometers) elevate surface narrative; resolution feels rushed despite thematic cohesion, limiting deeper emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on familiar rebel-against-system tropes; some vivid imagery ("industrial claws") undercut by generic descriptors like "dreamlike;" avoids excessive purple prose but lacks linguistic distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements incorporated mechanically rather than organically; brevity strains thematic consistency; memorable imagery outweighs structural weaknesses but fails to fully transcend constraints.</comment>
