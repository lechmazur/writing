<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; motivation to seal covenant remains vague, unlinked to specific trauma or growth. "Indifference" too passive to drive narrative urgency, though ribbon's symbolism offers fleeting introspective moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure follows descent-as-metaphor, but lacks narrative stakes or concrete consequences for failure. Connection between bells/time-shifting and covenant ritual feels underexplored. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (flickering torches, crumbling relics) and conceptual resonance of labyrinth-time between bells. Catacombs feel like physical manifestation of psychological entrapment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story evokes haunting mood but struggles to sustain emotional engagement. Literary devices (whispering walls, covenant-as-forging) suggest depth but lack payoff. Ending feels like abrupt cessation rather than resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but relies on familiar gothic imagery (ruined chalices, chanting). Language occasionally veers into overwrought description without deeper significance. "Haw" as anchoring device borders on gimmickry.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story prioritizes tone over thematic cohesion. Assigned elements function as scaffolding rather than organic components. Lingering questions about covenant mechanics and character backstory feel unresolved rather than intentionally ambiguous.</comment>
