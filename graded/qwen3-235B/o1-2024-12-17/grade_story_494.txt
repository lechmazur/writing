<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's arrogance and doubt are present but lack layered internal conflict; motivations are implied rather than demonstrated through action; reactions to the tapestry are symbolic but thinly developed; voice lacks distinctiveness in narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on abstract transitions; the calligraphy master's role shifts abruptly; the tapestry's revelation feels tacked on rather than earned through preceding action; pacing lags in mid-sections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative details (sword rasp, calligraphy strokes) but lacks full sensory immersion; setting functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than active participant; harsh tenderness tone is inconsistently applied across descriptions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (shackled potential, ancestral tapestry) elevate themes, but emotional impact is diluted; ending resolves arcs predictably; subtext about authority and lineage is clear but not freshly explored.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vocabulary occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ('harsh tenderness,' 'resolute lineage'); blends familiar tropes (arrogant hero's redemption) with unique combinations (calligraphy/swordplay); emotional nuance feels more stated than shown through specific actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't seamlessly integrated; some forced connections (wedding song's abrupt appearance); length feels restrictive rather than deliberate; style balances poetic and concrete but occasionally obscures clarity.</comment>
