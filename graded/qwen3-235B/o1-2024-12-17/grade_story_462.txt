<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's weariness and yearning are symbolic but lack psychological depth; motivations are clear but not grounded in tangible history or unique voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Linear progression works within constraints, but the arc hinges on esoteric symbolism rather than organic cause-and-effect; resolution feels abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere with rich sensory details; setting acts as metaphor and emotional catalyst, anchoring the story's ethereal themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor (cradle, tapping), layered subtext, and resonant ending; style elevates theme, though emotional beats occasionally veer toward abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes with original imagery (e.g., "hammered repose"), though some phrases lean lyrical without sufficient grounding; tension between mystery and clarity maintained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Compelling thematic cohesion despite narrow arc; brevity amplifies metaphorical focus rather than limits, but impact relies heavily on atmospheric vagueness.</comment>
