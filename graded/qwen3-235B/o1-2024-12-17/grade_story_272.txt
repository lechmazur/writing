<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's socially awkward nature is present but mostly through isolation rather than authentic interactions; motivation to build anew from regret is clear but lacks visceral emotional grounding; "hopeful cynicism" remains abstract without sufficient behavioral manifestation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc (discovery → epiphany) is present but compressed unevenly; cause-effect coherence between manuscript study and archive unlocking feels underdeveloped; pacing balances introspection and action but resolution arrives abruptly despite atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Diner setting's sensory details (neon flicker, lukewarm coffee) establish mood effectively; however, "encrypted message archive" remains purely conceptual rather than integrated space; atmosphere supports melancholic tone but disconnects from physical diner environment during climactic scenes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Use of metaphor ("tree of regret") and symbolism (whistle as fractured past) creates thematic resonance; however, emotional impact is diminished by abstract tell-over-show approach (e.g., "unspoken regrets" stated rather than embodied); ending provides closure but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (lonely inventor, redemptive artifact) without strong subversion; writing occasionally becomes overwrought ("crumbling manuscripts" → "reversed trails" progression lacks organic flow); metaphors conceptually engaging but insufficiently grounded in specific detail.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>All elements technically cohere thematically but unevenly drive narrative; diner setting and whistle work best synthetically; "reversed trails" and "archive" feel loosely integrated; prose style maintains consistency but struggles to balance lyrical abstraction with narrative clarity.</comment>
