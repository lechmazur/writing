<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Limited behavioral evidence for "patient" designation; internal conflict only mildly demonstrated through passive recollection rather than active choices; motivation to bury hatred lacks tangible stakes or consequences; voice remains abstractly poetic without distinctive authorial fingerprint.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Non-linear memories create coherence issues; thematic resolution exists but lacks narrative momentum; pacing stalls during ornamental descriptions; cause/effect diluted by excessive atmosphere; word limit exacerbates abrupt transitions between reflection and transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Steampunk elements superficially vivid but mechanically disconnected from emotional core; sensory overload weakens focus; "savage grace" concept only loosely embodied in imagery; cogs/music juxtapositions lack symbolic payoff; atmosphere occasionally becomes setting's sole purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors occasionally resonate (cogs/orchestra) but often verge on clich√©; emotional impact diluted by excessive abstraction; theme of ephemeral success is clear but underexplored through character actions; ending avoids sentimentality but feels contrived through sudden conversion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Formulaic "cogs as memory" mechanics; overly polished descriptors ("savage grace") without earned gravitas; inconsistent emotional progression; melodic transitions between memories feel algorithmically patterned rather than psychologically motivated; mixed success avoiding purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structured around elements rather than organic development; forced poeticism complicates clarity; length restricts emotional buildup but suits micro-epiphany structure; atmospheric originality outweighs derivative emotional arc; lingers briefly through sensory resonance rather than thematic profundity.</comment>
