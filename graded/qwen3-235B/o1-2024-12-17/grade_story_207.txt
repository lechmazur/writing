<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "meekly assertive" trait is inconsistently demonstrated through vague actions rather than concrete behavior, weakening the connection between his personality and oaths. His motivation is stated but lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through rumor-sifting, but the resolution feels abrupt and underdeveloped. The device's introduction lacks foreshadowing, disrupting the arc's coherence despite the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Abandoned medical bay's atmosphere is evocative but underutilized; "joyful loneliness" is stated rather than embodied through sensory details. The setting's symbolic potential (regret, renewal) is only partially realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (dried flowers, humming universe) and subtext about sacrifice resonate, but the ending leans on sentimental closure rather than earning emotional impact through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("secret song," "raw edges"). The peddler’s blend of mercy and obsession feels human, though the "rumor-laden columns" border on contrived plotting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack synergistic depth. The brevity amplifies weaknesses in character and theme, though the central quest maintains a haunting, if familiar, philosophical core.</comment>
