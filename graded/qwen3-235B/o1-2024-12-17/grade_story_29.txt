<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cleaverly naive is inconsistently portrayed; while stated, actions lack nuance that would make the trait organically influential. Motivation to sabotage machine is clear but underexplored beyond surface-level desire. Reactions to elements like jigsaw edge don't deepen characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Action drives plot but feels rushed within word limit. Connection between beginning and end exists (streetlamp motif) but lacks gradual build. Cause-effect logic for syncing frequencies feels tacked on rather than earned. Pacing veers from atmospheric to abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Orchard's sensory details create immersive atmosphere, though hedge maze feels underutilized. Streetlamp flicker as timeframe device works but doesn't shape atmosphere. Regret-storing sculptures add conceptual weight, but mechanical elements clash tonally with mystical garden.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Final paragraph evokes emotional resonance, but earlier sections rely on stated emotions like "agonizing bliss." Symbolism (regrets as machine fuel) has thematic potential but is superficially explored. Central conflict resolved too neatly for the scale.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "phantoms caught in moonlight" show ingenuity, but knight/sabotage tropes are generic. Sensory detail of "electric tingle" lacks specificity. Writing occasionally veers into purple prose ("spiraling vines and luminous fruit"). Emotional arc resolves predictably without subverting redemption arc expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve plot but lack deeper synthesis. Brief length works for fairy-tale structure but limits thematic payoff. The machine's defeat feels functional rather than narratively inevitable. Tension exists but isn't sustained through quieter moments.</comment>
