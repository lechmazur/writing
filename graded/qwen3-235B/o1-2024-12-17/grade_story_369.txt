<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation is implied rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. The puzzle maker’s fanaticism lacks complexity in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fragmented structure undermines coherence; plot elements are crammed without organic cause-effect progression or a fully realized arc despite atmospheric bookends. Pacing unevenly balances urgency and introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative, concrete details (gulls, machinery, salt-stained walls) immerse readers in a haunting, tactile environment. The lighthouse’s physicality profoundly shapes mood and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism (string, puzzles) hint at deeper themes but culminate in a perfunctory resolution. Tension between secrecy and revelation is felt, but emotional authenticity remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overly stylized prose occasionally verges on self-indulgent (e.g., “lethargic excitement”), while the isolated, obsessive protagonist risks cliché. Some phrases feel formulaic despite flashes of inventiveness in setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack unified purpose; the story’s brevity highlights forced integration of assignments rather than leveraging constraints for artistic depth. Lingering impression is atmospheric but underdeveloped.</comment>
