<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation for mastering silence is clear but underdeveloped; his self-awareness feels abrupt rather than earned, and his "wide-eyed" trait lacks follow-through beyond initial description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on message-hijacking as a central action, but the method is abstractly executed without tangible stakes or clear cause-effect; pacing oscillates between rushed details and stagnant introspection, undermining cohesion within the tight limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Underwater setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (glowing jellyfish, algae-choked walls) and tone cohesion, but the submerged city’s uniqueness doesn’t deepen the character’s arc or thematic concerns beyond atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imagery like "silent revolution" and rune-glimmering metaphors add subtext; the ending’s thematic resonance with restraint is effective. However, introspective passages occasionally overwrite, favoring abstraction over visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose veers toward ornate descriptors (“hazy lights dancing,” “errant clues”) and clichéd phrasing (“flowing in his veins”), but the hybrid of streetwise cunning and mystical elements avoids total predictability; emotional stakes are felt but not fully embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elegant fragments of originality exist (message-board subterfuge as quiet rebellion), but the story leans on atmospheric density over narrative momentum; elements cohere thematically but lack structural urgency within its brevity.</comment>
