<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character remains consistent but lacks depth; motivations are implied through symbols and actions rather than fully realized internal conflict or distinct voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structure exists but lacks clear progression; the ending feels abrupt and underdeveloped, with cause-effect relationships implied rather than earned through narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory details immerse readers in the steampunk setting, though some descriptions verge on excessive without advancing plot or character.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on steampunk and parallel world tropes without fresh subversion; repetitive phrasing ("improbable confessions," "subtly menacing charge") and ornate prose undermine uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements are tightly interwoven but feel like checklist items rather than organically unified narrative; brevity sacrifices narrative depth.</comment>
