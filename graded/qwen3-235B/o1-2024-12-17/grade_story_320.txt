<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Shyness is superficially portrayed but inconsistently affects actions; motivation to fix cosmic imbalance lacks layered connection to personal traits; character's internal/external contrasts remain underdeveloped despite symbolic self-reflections.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but feels compressed; the social media method introduces abrupt conceptual shifts; cause-effect between photographs, posts, and cosmic resolution lacks sufficient throughlines to fully satisfy within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Underwater setting is vividly atmospheric with coral, runes, and currents, but sensory details lack variety; tone aligns with cosmic themes but insufficiently explores tactile qualities of submerged reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of photographs and psychic tapestry; ending ties to beginnings through transformed imagery; conceptually engaging but emotional weight remains diffuse despite lyrical prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through hybrid elements (social media in ancient ruins) but occasionally strains credibility; metaphors feel fresh though some phrases flirt with ornateness; balances AI-generated coherence with imaginative leaps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not all organically integrated; underwater setting and timelines work well, but social media's role feels contrived; conceptually ambitious yet uneven in execution for publishable perfection.</comment>
