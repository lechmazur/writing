<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Absence of internal conflict or emotional depth undermines the "jumpy" motivation; actions like raising skeletons lack personal reasoning and fail to reveal nuanced character psychology despite surreal context.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot advances through checklist-style progression of assigned elements rather than organic causality; resolution feels perfunctory despite minimal arc, with pacing alternating between rushed code-labyrinth journeys and stagnant exposition-heavy paragraphs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Masterful integration of glitch-logic visuals and interactive media language ("sprites," "polygonal mountains") creates distinctive sensory layers that unify setting and tone more effectively than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Protest mural symbolism contains potential thematic power but remains surface-level; vivid imagery and conceptual contrasts (resurrection vs digital decay) elevate craft above conventionality despite uneven emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on video game clich√©s ("unmask revered icon") and AI-typical compound metaphors ("spectral code") undercut originality, though specific details about paint drip cryptography offer inventive fusion of analog/digital aesthetics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres through stylistic momentum more than structural integrity; elements work together aesthetically but lack thematic cohesion, leaving concept of "jumpy necromancy" under-explored while retro-digital aesthetic dominates.</comment>
