<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but remains abstract without emotional depth or internal conflict. Actions align with assigned traits but lack nuance in psychological realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc within constraints; movement from exploration to discovery to resolution is logical. Pacing occasionally lingers on atmospheric details at the expense of momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered through sensory details (rotting seaweed, cracked scrolls) and atmospheric contrasts between decay and hope. Underwater multiverse cohesion feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rich imagery and thematic resonance around shared resilience enhance impact, but emotional engagement relies heavily on tone rather than character-driven stakes or subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s through inventive combinations (orchardist in underwater archives), but some phrases ("phantom fingers," "bittersweet grit") lean on poetic abstraction over fresh metaphorical innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Highly cohesive across assigned elements with purposeful integration, though the multiverse concept feels more decorative than integral. Themes resonate but depth is limited by brevity.</comment>
