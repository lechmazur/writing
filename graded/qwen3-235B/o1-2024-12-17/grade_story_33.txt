<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic, traits stated more than demonstrated. Motivation via poetic phrasing rather than concrete behavior, lacks distinct narrative voice despite introspective tone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Abstract progression replaces plot; thematic echoes substitute for cause-effect logic. Completeness achieved via symbolic gesture (mask placement), but lacks traditional momentum within constrained scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds through tactile details (shattered porcelain texture, mirrored floors) and tonal contrasts. Setting's sterile precision effectively juxtaposes cosmic abstraction, though functional connection to plot remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and metaphorical density impress, but emotional resonance remains intellectualized. Theme of balance/universal interconnectedness emerges clearly, yet tension between cosmic stakes and intimate setting feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s via unconventional conceptual mashups (leaf taxonomy + cosmic philosophy). Some recursive phrasing ("braided bitterness") risks ornamental excess. Subtextual depth genuine but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere as philosophical mosaic rather than narrative engine. Style dominates over substance; brevity feels both intentional and constraining. Lingering impression rests on poetic rhythm over dramaturgical rigor.</comment>
