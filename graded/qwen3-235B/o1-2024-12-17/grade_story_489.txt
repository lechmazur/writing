<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Unseen observer's motivation to rescue traditions is conceptually clear but emotionally opaque; "aggressively kind" attribute is stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions; reactions to the whistle lack psychological depth; character remains an abstract vessel rather than a fully realized individual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by compressed cause-effect chains; whale's call as catalyst feels arbitrary rather than inevitable; transitions between lighthouse/dancer/spectral elements risk disunity despite thematic connections; circular structure (dancer's first step to final footfall) provides minimal arc within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haunted lighthouse watch room evokes strong atmosphere through sensuous details (chipped windowsill, trembling walls) but spectral mariners remain underexploited; brazen calm tone inconsistently maintained through high-drama whale call; object-setting connection strong with whistle's humble presence in haunted space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heightened poetic language successfully evokes theme of tradition revival; effective symbolism through merging dancer/whistle/light symbolism; some emotional resonance but undercut by overly ornate phrasing; subtext on cultural preservation emerges clearly despite narrative abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unusual element combinations (children's whistle with hidden power) but contains AI-writing hallmarks: repetitive adverbial emphasis ("brazenly," "quietly") and overly abstract descriptors; metaphor density occasionally veers into purple prose; thematic originality compensates for occasional generic phrasing patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elements superficially coalesce but lack organic integration; the brevity feels limiting rather than intentional; creative synthesis present in connecting dance/whale/light motifs, but deeper exploration constrained by format; lingering questions about tradition's meaning remain underdeveloped.</comment>
