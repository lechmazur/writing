<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has clear traits and motivation but lacks emotional depth and consistent nuance. His dialogue isn't distinct enough to reinforce the "comically serious" attribute.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has basic structure (setup-demonstration-decision) but feels compressed, with the climactic decision at dawn arriving too abruptly without sufficient tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setting lacks immersive sensory integration—smells of tea, textures of worn objects, or climatic conditions at altitude are underdeveloped. Atmosphere is intriguing but thinly rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong use of paradoxical imagery (e.g., sentinels snapping at insects) and subtext about obsession, but emotional resonance is diluted by excessive exposition. Ending hints at thematic potential yet feels unresolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by combining botany with film analysis but contains slightly bloated descriptions of phenomena. The fusion of science and myth shows ingenuity but risks incoherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren’t tightly interwoven—carnivorous plants serve more as spectacle than narrative drivers. The story’s brevity works thematically but sacrifices structural cohesion.</comment>
