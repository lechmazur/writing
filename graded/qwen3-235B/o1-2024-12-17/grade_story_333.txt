<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation to preserve traditions is clear, but lacks emotional depth and transformative arc. Rebel identity feels superficial, defined more by actions than internal conflict or growth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression with thematic bookends about tradition vs. oblivion, but pacing falters—mansion’s shifting nature is occasionally overstuffed with descriptive detours that dilute momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with tactile details (damp chill, "braided bitterness"), though occasionally devolves into self-conscious poeticizing (e.g., "clash of thunder to shift its configuration").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Combines metaphor (shifting architecture as psychological mirror) with thematic resonance about courage and legacy. Ending resonates but leans on told emotions ("felt a pang of sympathy") over nuanced subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some overused tropes (whispers, sentient labyrinths) and occasionally ornate phrasing, but the architectural fear-test concept salvages originality. Emotional beats could be more subtly rendered rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren’t fully interdependent; the "between storms" motif and guild secrets feel peripheral to core themes. Ending leaves thematic residue but lacks piercing finality.</comment>
