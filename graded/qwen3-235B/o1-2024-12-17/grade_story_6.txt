<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's skepticism is consistent but lacks depth in motivations; inner conflict hinted at but underdeveloped. Voice remains distinct but lacks complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels condensed; cause-and-effect between slingshot's resonance and hidden door lacks grounding. Pacing stumbles slightly but maintains coherence in limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered (steam vents, chemical smells) and atmospherically complements the dragon-hide armor's mystique. Some underutilized connections between disappearing ink and "reputation theft" remain.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong imagery (e.g., "transfixed by humming armor") and thematic hints about generosity vs. cunning exist, but emotional impact diluted by narrative distance; lacks subtextual layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally veers into purple prose ("irreverent awe," "impossibly plausible"). Sensory details are effective but unevenly distributed; dialogue minimal but functional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements are generally cohesive but feel checklist-driven; style elevates material but struggles to unify disparate motifs (ink, armor, slingshot). Lingering questions about themes are underdeveloped.</comment>
