<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation around atonement is clear but lacks concrete backstory to fully ground his internal conflict; symbolism of the abacus is strong but psychological depth feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear progression from wandering to climbing, but the snow-pattern navigation feels underexplained; pacing balances introspection and action within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal gloom of the orchard and snow create vivid atmosphere; sensory details (rattling abacus, twisting stalks) immerse effectively, though ontological rules of the setting remain intriguingly ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (missing beads, dull radiance) to explore guilt and redemption; prose has lyrical quality but some emotional beats lean on abstraction rather than visceral showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original setting avoids genre clich√©s but occasionally veers into dreamlike abstraction; introspective tone is consistent though cyclical rumination risks monotony.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve themes of spiritual disorientation; length creates urgency but prevents deeper exploration of priest's backstory; lingering questions about fate's "design" feel intentional.</comment>
