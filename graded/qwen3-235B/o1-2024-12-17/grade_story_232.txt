<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks complexity; motivation is consistent but superficially developed through repetitive descriptors rather than nuanced internal logic or emotional evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear path but struggles with pacing and abrupt transitions (e.g., sudden discovery of cove); the 500-word constraint emphasizes plot over character or thematic development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (crumbling coastline, coffee grounds) create immersive sensory experience; however, the modern "digital nomad camp" jars with piratical/ancient elements, weakening cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Uses rich metaphors and symbolic resonance (coffee as prophecy, cutlass as key); the ending achieves thematic unity but leans on familiar tropes about decoding ancient mysteries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic "treasure hunt" clich√©s through coffee-ground divination conceit, but falls into predictable patterns (obsessed protagonist, haunted quest); language occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but lack deeper integration (e.g., "digital nomads" feel like window dressing); ambitious thematic synthesis of art/purpose/obsession undercut by shallow character work.</comment>
