<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth or emotional contradictions; traits like "infuriatingly calm" are stated but not dramatized. Motivation against despair remains abstract rather than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure maintains cohesion but avoids concrete cause-effect. Plot momentum stalls in repetitive descriptions; resolution feels disconnected from earlier tensions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is elegantly vague but lacks visceral sensory immersion. Settings function as symbols rather than lived-in spaces; "probability mapping center" remains conceptually underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Poetic flourishes outweigh emotional engagement. Theme of collective potential lacks narrative or character-specific stakes; ending abandons tension for vague transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Originality in conceptual fusion (probability + piano keys) offsets occasional purple prose and overused metaphors like "fragile possibilities". Avoids genre tropes but leans on abstract poeticism as crutch.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity but lack narrative justification. Style elevates concept but sacrifices emotional weight; tight word limit exposed underdeveloped character and plot mechanics.</comment>
