<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Boastfulness is consistent but lacks psychological depth; internal conflict feels superficially imposed rather than organically revealed through action or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from exploration to revelation, but pivotal moments (splicing tissues, rune-carving) feel rushed; balloon pops as recurring motif strains narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visceral, insectile textures juxtapose oddly with balloon pops; creates surreal dissonance that undermines atmospheric cohesion despite vivid sensory writing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (molten steel purpose, layered madness) resonate; ending raises questions about reality but underdeveloped emotional stakes limit philosophical impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Hybrid surrealism/hero's journey avoids clich√© but overwritten phrases ("precise madness that defined his journey") border on self-indulgent without thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</comment><grade>World-building intrigues but thematic integration falters; labyrinthine escape narrative gains conceptual weight through "rewiring illusions" yet remains primarily atmospheric exercise.</comment>
