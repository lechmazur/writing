<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains more archetype than multidimensional; motivations are present but surface-level exploration of 'unruffled' nature lacks nuance or transformation despite key events.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot maintains forward momentum through surreal discoveries connecting vow and ritual, but corridor revelation and ritual execution feel slightly rushed within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elegant sensory details (dust, luminescence) immerse readers, but 'labyrinthine' library's historical context and café timeframe integration remain underdeveloped, slightly weakening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (color from sorrow) and theme of hope vs. entropy resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract descriptions prioritizing lyricism over visceral character embodiment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Combines mythic and surreal elements inventively, but recurring ornate phrasing (e.g., “incandescent swirl”) and structured dream-logic sequences occasionally feel formulaic rather than organically imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist harmoniously but don’t deeply interlock; high-concept premises strain brevity, leaving themes and character development undersaturated for maximum literary impact.</comment>
