<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character possesses intriguing traits (telekinesis, tapestry fragment) and a clear preservationist motivation, but deeper emotional stakes and personal history remain underdeveloped. Actions align with traits, but psychological nuance suffers from conceptual overload.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates loose coherence with beginning (problem setup), middle (flame crisis/tapestry decoding), and resolution (navigation escape). Pacing feels slightly rushed but maintains momentum. Connections between elements (tapestry languages and safe route) feel purposeful but somewhat forced.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in vivid details (flickering holograms, tattered coats) but struggles to fully merge "sacred disorder" tone with pirate chaos. Sensory elements effectively establish mood, though medieval/cosmic hybrid setting lacks full contextual integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong visual imagery and symbolic elements (tree-planting, dragon tapestry) elevate craft, but emotional resonance remains superficial. Subtext about cultural preservation hints at depth without full realization. Ending resolves practical plot but lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original at concept level (medieval-futurist fusion), but execution veers toward ornate descriptions over nuanced character psychology. Avoids most clich√©s through unusual combinations but occasionally relies on genre tropes (treasure-snatching pirates).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story successfully incorporates assigned elements but struggles to fuse them into a seamless whole. Some aspects (tree-planting tradition) feel appended rather than organic. Strong conceptual ambition but uneven emotional payoff and structural polish limit overall impact.</comment>
