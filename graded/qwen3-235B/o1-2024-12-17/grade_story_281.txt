<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character motivation exists as stated concept but lacks psychological grounding; baffled state feels abstract rather than earned through organic reactions; actions appear arbitrarily connected to purported goals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure substitutes atmosphere for narrative progression; abrupt dummy animation lacks causal setup; transformation arc feels imposed rather than emerging from character decisions; poetic method introduced without organic integration.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Overly generic "haunted" descriptors (rusted pipes, flickering lanterns) fail to create distinctive physicality; atmosphere dominates at expense of functional setting-character interaction; sensory details lack idiosyncratic specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Mixed literary effectiveness: striking metaphors ("chains dissolving midair") undercut by pretentious abstractions; thematic preoccupations apparent but superficially treated; attempts at subtext undermined by heavy-handedness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Riddled with artificial syntax ("confusingly lucid" recurs as lazy paradox), generic emotional beats, and AI-typical adjective clusters; failed to transcend genre tropes (haunted object empowering underdog); poetic revelation feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements present but inertly arranged; thematic intention evident yet execution feels algorithmically assembled; atmospheric potential squandered through inconsistent symbolic function; fleeting intriguing images insufficient for lasting impact.</comment>
