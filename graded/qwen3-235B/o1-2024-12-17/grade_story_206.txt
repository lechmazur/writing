<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's vendetta and locket loss are consistent motivators, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Actions align logically with vendetta yet lack complex psychological nuance. Sculptor's "voice" is stylistically consistent but generic, relying on stated emotions rather than shown behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently from market-based counterattack toward hidden continent, but rushed progression between key incidents. Pacing stumbles at confrontation scene's action sequence, losing tension through abrupt transitions. The revenge arc completes, but lacks structural complexity suitable for prestigious publication. Causality remains logical but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decaying market with flickering lanterns and squalor creates strong sensory base. Somnenia's hinted mystery adds dimension, though connection between rebellion timeframe and market setting remains underdeveloped. Symbolism of candy fragility vs. enduring locket works conceptually but lacks organic integration with environmental storytelling. Tactile candy descriptions impress.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and candy-as-weapon concept show craft, yet emotional impact feels manufactured rather than earned. Theme of vengeance vs. hope occasionally surfaces through plot progression but lacks subtextual richness. Ending satisfies plot needs but fails to resonate thematically. Shows more than tells effectively in environmental descriptions, less so in character development.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Detects formulaic sentence structures and repeated descriptive patterns ("precisely creative", "ardent scorn"). Overuses "forget/forgotten" motif as connective tissue rather than organic narrative element. Some transitions between scenes feel mechanical rather than motivated. Dialogue absent, limiting character nuance. Tropes like lost heirloom and rebellious revenge lack sufficient subversion, though candy medium offers modest originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements incorporated with functional cohesion but uneven depth. Market setting serves primarily decorative rather than structural purpose. The photographs-as-clues concept feels appended rather than integral. Candy sculpting shows creative potential but remains more surface conceit than thematic anchor. Sufficiently compelling for short form, yet lacks ambitious reinvention of assigned constraints.</comment>
