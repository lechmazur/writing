<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations hinted at but not fully embodied through actions or reactions. Assigned attribute "desperately casual" inadequately realized in coherent behavior patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot fragments cohere superficially but lack cause-effect progression. Journey structure fails to generate momentum despite poetic imagery. Resolution feels arbitrarily imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical descriptions establish haunting atmosphere with swirling nebulae and trembling stardust. However, sensory details beyond sight remain underdeveloped. Timeframe element underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Metaphors create poetic resonance but overreliance on phrase repetition ("heartbreak-induced visions") weakens cumulative impact. Central theme of empathy emerges clearly but remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Excessive simile clusters ("flickered like lightning") and cyclical phrase patterns suggest formulaic construction. Overwrought descriptions ("spectral horrors") border on purple prose. Emotional nuance sacrificed for stylistic density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic props rather than organic components. Despite poetic flourishes, narrative lacks distinct authorial vision beneath metaphysical trappings. Fails to transcend its own ornamental style.</comment>
