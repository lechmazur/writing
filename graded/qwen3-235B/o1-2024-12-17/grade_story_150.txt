<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but underdeveloped; motivations hinted at through poetic musings but lack psychological depth; inconsistent agency between passive observation and active intervention; voice lacks distinctiveness beyond ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Weak narrative arc; episodic progression without strong causal links; unresolved tension between cosmic misalignment and character agency; pacing uneven with underexplored action consequences; ending feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive steampunk elements effectively deployed; atmospheric details vivid but occasionally distract from plot; setting-object integration strong (dice/gears connection), though coffee shop walls' sentience feels tonally inconsistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery fails to cohere into substantial theme; metaphors about alignment/destiny remain superficial; ending lacks emotional weight despite poetic language; some effective showing in mechanical descriptions but overreliance on abstract "ambivalence" telling.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overuse of clich√©d steampunk tropes; repetitive flourishes ("saturated ambivalence") and generic cosmic mysticism; forced surrealism in coffee shop phenomenon; inconsistent tone shifts between Western grit and New Age metaphysics; lacks authentic emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Uneven execution of required elements; setting and objects (dice, dome) work better than contrived narrative mechanisms (sentient walls); style prioritizes ornament over substance; conceptually ambitious but lacks narrative discipline for prestigious publication standards.</comment>
