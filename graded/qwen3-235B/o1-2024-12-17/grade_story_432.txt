<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Delia's death wish drives her actions but lacks psychological depth; motivations around mapping energy flows feel unearned. The poison-tasting role shapes her cosmic role but isn't fully interrogated beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot hinges on mystical revelations but lacks logical cause-effect flow; abrupt shifts between talk-radio psychics and subterranean society disrupt coherence. The ice sculpture climax feels extrinsically imposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends mystical and sensory elements (waterfalls, vibrations) with mixed effectiveness. Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("serene upheaval") dilutes immersion; talk-radio psychic clue-finding feels jarringly modern in an otherwise mythic setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (bookmark as energy map) and cosmic themes show ambition, but emotional resonance suffers from abstraction. The ending attempts transcendence but lacks visceral impact; subtext about purpose in death remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on mystical society tropes without subversion; "serene upheaval" and psychic elements verge on clich√©. Overly ornate phrasing ("hushed delirium") and inconsistent tone suggest formulaic writing. Originality emerges in energy-mapping conceit but uneven execution undermines distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing; the poison-tasting premise and energy flows feel conceptually disconnected. The brief length limits thematic depth, with ideas introduced but not fully realized. Lingering intrigue stems from unresolved cosmic concepts rather than achieved narrative cohesion.</comment>
