<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is visually rendered but lacks psychological depth; motivations feel allegorical rather than human-scaled, with actions driven more by symbolic purpose than coherent interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a ritualistic arc with emotional progression but lacks tangible stakes or conflict; pacing relies on lyrical repetition rather than dramatic tension, making the transformation feel unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid visual atmosphere dominates with effective sensory textures (dust, light refractions) but underutilizes olfactory/kinetic elements; the setting supports thematic resonance but could deepen its ecological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical layering (glitter as depleted hope, stained glass as fractured potential) elevates the narrative, but emotional impact remains diffuse due to heavy reliance on abstract emotional cues over embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality lies in juxtaposing post-apocalyptic motifs with fairy-tale symbolism, but the execution risks purple prose through excessive adjectival density; emotional vulnerability feels archetypal rather than freshly observed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coheres as a lyrical parable, with elements purposefully arranged but occasionally schematic; the compressed form prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum, leaving conceptual weight overshadowing organic character engagement.</comment>
