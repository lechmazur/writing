<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a spiritual awakening arc but pacing stumbles; roller coaster metaphor intrudes illogically, while cause-effect between Elias's actions and supernatural reactions lacks buildup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but force-fitted connections (roller coaster, new book scent) undermine narrative authenticity; themes require deeper exploration.</comment>
