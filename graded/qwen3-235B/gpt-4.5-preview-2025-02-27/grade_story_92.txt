<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but transitions feel abrupt; the dog walker background isn't deeply tied to internal conflict despite "carefully careless" trait. Defiant declaration feels less earned than narratively imposed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plotted with precision for word count, but the blood drive encounter strains credibility as a catalyst; resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through narrative logic. Pacing maintains tension without sacrificing clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through visceral details - botanical grotesquery, suffocating silence - but the twilight timeframe serves more as mood dressing than structural element. Mansion's history remains frustratingly opaque despite being central to stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical heft in plants-as-secrets concept elevates narrative; ending sacrifices psychological complexity for thematic neatness. The "loud silence" motif resonates but occasionally overexplains with heavy-handed metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids outright clich√©s but leans on familiar gothic tropes; botanical descriptions occasionally verge on purple prose. Eleanor's arc feels human but the sudden shift from apathy to courage lacks nuanced emotional scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively if superficially - mansion, plants, and agreements form a thematically satisfying triad, though the blood drive and dog walker roles remain awkwardly appended rather than organically essential.</comment>
