<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but psychological complexity lacks depth; servitude resentment hinted but not interwoven with artistic process or artifact recognition. Sudden transcendence feels disconnected from earlier brooding established in mundane tasks.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression hinges on implausible artifact discovery and metaphysical conclusion; tension builds effectively through surveillance of scientists but dissolves into abstraction. Pacing struggles to balance worldbuilding with abrupt metaphysical transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from tactile descriptions of dust motes and scratched glasses, but the research base setting remains sterile and underexplored. Sensory details partially immerse but fail to concretize the "murky tenderness" tone consistently.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery of dust and freedom resonates thematically; however, the ending's metaphorical dissolution leans toward pretension over profundity. The duality theme ("sculptor and sculpture") emerges clearly but lacks nuanced emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Attempts originality through metaphysical transformation but relies on overused "artist transcending physicality" tropes. Overly poetic descriptions ("fractured beams," "murky tenderness") border on purple prose; some character nuance lost in abstract plot.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element integration is inconsistent: glasses and dust method contribute to cohesion, but artifact's connection to protagonist feels contrived. Story lingers thematically but execution uneven, weakening overall impact.</comment>
