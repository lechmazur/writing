<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Contrasts between Elias' physicality and demeanor show promise, but inner conflict lacks granular development; motivations tied to the letter and nightmares are clear but could benefit from more nuanced internal struggle or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing balances introduction and resolution within word constraints, but key transitions (e.g., Sylvie’s betrayal revelation) feel abrupt, undercutting emotional weight; cause-effect logic holds but lacks depth in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative details like dew-slick cobblestones and ossuary ambience succeed, but sensory immersion falters in key moments; the setting’s potential as a haunting yet healing space is underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of redemption and inherited trauma resonate, but subtext remains surface-level; dialogue leans expository, and metaphors (e.g., "revamp") feel overly literal rather than integrated into the story’s emotional core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While the ossuary-restaurant setting is inventive, the "letter from the future" and "healing traditions" border on trope; stylistic flourishes (e.g., "harsh tenderness") occasionally tip into forced lyricism, betraying mechanical phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently stitched together but rarely transcend their assignment; the ending’s hope feels earned but unremarkable, lacking lingering resonance or risk; cohesion exists, but creativity feels strained.</comment>
