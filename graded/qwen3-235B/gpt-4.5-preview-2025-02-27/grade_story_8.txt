<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but emotional depth remains underdeveloped; "dazed" state inconsistently portrayed through actions and internal logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure lacks tension; actions follow logically but feel static rather than dynamic; circularity weakens narrative arc despite tidy conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (humming metal, dawn light) create immersive atmosphere, though some setting-character connections remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (logic vs. madness, chalk as rebellion) and thematic cohesion elevate impact, though emotional resonance occasionally veers toward abstraction over visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending empirical critique with mystical elements exists, but occasionally falters into ornate phrasing and familiar "rebel against tradition" tropes without sufficient subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but feel polished rather than revelatory; constrained form serves the narrative but limits deeper exploration of complex ideas.</comment>
