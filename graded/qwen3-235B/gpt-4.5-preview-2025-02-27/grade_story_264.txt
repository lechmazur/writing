<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (bridge science/alchemy) is clear and consistent with Elias' actions, but limited depth in inner conflict or growth within short format; voice distinct but occasionally verges on didactic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from tension to resolution with efficient cause-effect; structure feels deliberate but resolution slightly rushed given word count constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly immersive through tactile and visual details (projector hums, fractured starlight); setting works as active collaborator in thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Richly layered metaphor (cracked lens as imperfect perception), emotionally resonant subtext, and satisfying thematic resolution elevate storytelling impact beyond surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh combination of low-tech projector/space science with alchemy avoids clich√©; language occasionally ornate but generally purposeful and stylistically consistent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements (cracked lens, outdated tech) are organically integrated to serve theme; story feels intentionally compact while leaving lingering philosophical resonance.</comment>
