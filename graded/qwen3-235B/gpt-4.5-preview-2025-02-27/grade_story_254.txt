<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear but emotionally underdeveloped; his transformation through surrender feels logically consistent but lacks nuanced psychological layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is coherent with a clear arc, but the condensed word limit creates rushed transitions between pivotal moments like his failure to grasp stars and subsequent realization.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory details (ivy, rust, creaks), enhancing Arthur's isolation and symbolic decay, though the "unraveling tapestry" metaphor feels overly abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance around authenticity in art; metaphors (starlight, inkwell) are effective but occasionally heavy-handed. Ending risks sentimentality rather than earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés by juxtaposing surrealism with existential themes; however, the narrative’s emotional arc (artistic redemption) adheres to predictable patterns despite fresh imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into a cohesive whole, with symbolism driving both plot and theme. The brevity feels deliberate but sacrifices depth in Arthur’s internal conflict.</comment>
