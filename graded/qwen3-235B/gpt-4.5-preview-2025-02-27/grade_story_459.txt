<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is clear but underdeveloped; motivations tied to letting go are consistent yet lack depth in showing their evolution through action or dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pacing feels slightly rushed in conveying emotional arc; while the connection between Eli and the ghost resolves thematically, key transitions (e.g., initial encounter, lab setting) lack gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (machinery hums, fragile sand castles) effectively evoke atmosphere, but the ghost’s presence and dissonance of silence are sometimes conveyed through abstract description rather than immersive, concrete imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolism (sand castles, flower crown) enhance emotional resonance; ending’s thematic clarity elevates the narrative, though some emotional beats risk feeling overly stated rather than subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with unique concepts (e.g., sand castle preservation), but occasional flowery phrasing and reliance on familiar ghost-seeing tropes slightly undermine originality; emotional subtext feels genuine but unevenly rendered.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve the theme of impermanence, with the lab and flower crown as standout anchors; slight friction in how "stakeout" method and lunch break timeframe integrate organically into the story’s rhythm.</comment>
