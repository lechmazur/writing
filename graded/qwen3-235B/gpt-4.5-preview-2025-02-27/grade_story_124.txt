<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Superficial transformation; motivation stated rather than dramatized. Internal conflict underexplored despite central theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structural arc present but compressed; pivotal moments lack earned emotional resonance. Cause/effect relationships implied rather than fully realized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Striking juxtapositions undercut by inconsistent sensory integration. The colony's atmosphere doesn't deepen thematic concerns as fully as possible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Occasional purple prose, but the central metaphor combining memory/loom/dance demonstrates ingenuity. Character interiority occasionally simplistic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesive but not transcendent. Assigned elements present and interacting, though lunar setting remains more backdrop than active participant.</comment>
