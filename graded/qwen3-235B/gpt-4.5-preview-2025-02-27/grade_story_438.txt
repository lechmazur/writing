<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character traits feel more decorative than integral; motivations partially compelling but lack psychological depth despite atmospheric consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot adheres to structural arc but relies on vague transitions between genetic exploration and transcendence; pacing occasionally stumbles under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere juxtaposes sterile and mystical elements effectively, but sparse sensory details limit immersive impact beyond visual metaphors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic resonance (legacy/obsession) bolster emotional undercurrents, though ending prioritizes style over earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stylized prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; reliance on recurring motifs (e.g., "hollow recklessness") risks mechanical repetition rather than organic evolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but uneven in execution; elements serve the story superficially rather than interweaving into a unified, revelatory whole.</comment>
