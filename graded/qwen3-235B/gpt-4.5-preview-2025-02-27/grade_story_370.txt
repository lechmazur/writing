<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Internal conflicts are well-articulated, but exterior actions insufficiently demonstrate change; motivation for transformation feels abrupt without sufficient backstory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear emotional arc is present, but plot consists mostly of internal monologue with little external progression; beginning and end lack tangible stakes to ground the philosophical shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Quantum foam and desert metaphors create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details remain abstract; physicality of the comic as an object is underutilized despite its symbolic importance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors resonate thematically and image systems are cohesive, but relies heavily on 'showing' without creating emotionally visceral engagement; ending resolves neatly but lacks narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Quantum setting offers novelty, but transformation arc follows predictable 'awakening' tropes; overly poetic phrasing ("drift of desert sands") risks vagueness; emotional subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ideas cohere conceptually but execution feels schematic; poetic language aids thematic unity while emotional authenticity remains somewhat distant; brief length emphasizes concept over character.</comment>
