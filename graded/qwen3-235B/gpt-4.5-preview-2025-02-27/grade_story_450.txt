<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but shift feels abrupt; dancer's grace masks verbal struggles effectively. Conflict between movement and speech is well-established, but emotional depth could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is circular and thematically cohesive, but pacing stumbles during hologram reveal; prophecy resolution feels earned despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Contrast between sterile chamber and warm bath creates compelling atmosphere, but sensory details inconsistently integrated; setting symbolism occasionally overstated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (patch, mimicry) and thematic payoff; ending avoids clich√© by privileging introspection over exposition. Subtext about communication barriers lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright formulaic writing but exhibits AI tendencies: sporadic purple prose ("saturated ambivalence"), uneven emotional granularity in hologram sequence, slightly overcalculated thematic parallels.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive despite packed elements; brief length emphasizes thematic compression over character exploration. Conceptual elegance outweighs minor tonal inconsistencies.</comment>
