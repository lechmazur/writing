<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity beyond archetypal "fallen noble" traits; motivation to restore legacy feels cursory without deeper exploration of personal stakes or contradictions in his relationship with wealth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows predictable redemption arc with underdeveloped cause-effect; pivotal moments like discovering recipes or interacting with ghost lack narrative tension or logical progression within constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (shattered windows, lingering aromas) create immersive haunting atmosphere, though some overwritten descriptors ("blurry vividness") dilute impact; setting's decay effectively mirrors character's decline.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of legacy preservation resonate through symbolism (orchid candy as artifact), but emotional resonance undermined by explicit "message"; ghostly apparition device feels contrived rather than subtextual.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on gothic nostalgia tropes (haunted parks, ancestral ghosts) without fresh perspective; overwritten similes ("lingering memories like skeletal remains") verge on purple prose; character reasoning lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements combine mechanically rather than organically; brief length strains coherence but serves thematic brevity; thematic ambition outpaces execution in balancing atmospheric detail with character depth.</comment>
