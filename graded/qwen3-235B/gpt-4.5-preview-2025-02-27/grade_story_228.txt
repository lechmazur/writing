<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Clothespin gesture shows individuality, but overall structure follows AI-generated "escape dystopia" templates; symbolic repetition numbs thematic impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements present but mechanically connected; bunker existence lacks political-economic explanation; thematic ambition outweighs narrative integration.</comment>
