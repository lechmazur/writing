<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's "wisely foolish" trait lacks depth in decision-making. Motivation to reconcile inner fractures is present yet underexplored through active choices. The piano's symbolic weight doesn't fully connect to his core nature.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Logical flow between shadow-guided movement and piano climax exists but relies on passive "being pulled" mechanics. The circularity of broken lens/shattered lens resolution feels contrived within tight pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between decay (rusted strings) and nascent hope (spring's warmth) masterfully amplify tone. The haunted setting's reactive qualities (dancing shadows) deepen immersion despite occasional description overload.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elegant metaphor layering (musical mosaic as self) creates thematic resonance. Emotional weight struggles to match poetic density—the piano scene's catharsis leans more on imagery than earned character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids haunted house clichés through inventive object-function combinations (melodic specters as guides). Some overwritten phrases ("spectral chorus rising from stone") teeter toward ornate abstraction without deeper subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion achieved, but element integration varies in necessity. The seasonal transition feels more decorative than thematically vital. Leaves lingering questions about identity fragmentation rather than profound closure.</comment>
