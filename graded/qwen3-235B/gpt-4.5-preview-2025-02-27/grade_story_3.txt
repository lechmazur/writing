<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character transformation from surly to serene is conceptually clear but under-explored psychically; motivations are consistent but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a discernible arc but relies heavily on poetic abstraction to mask thin narrative progression; causality in cosmic realization feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly textured but struggles to fully marry "serenely frantic" tones to plot mechanics; sensory details occasionally overshadow thematic unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (marketplace of stars, yarn-as-cosmos) are striking but occasionally strain under explicit exposition; ending resonates without earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality in cosmic-maritime synthesis is undercut by familiar "wise elder teaching" trope and occasionally mannered prose; avoids major formulaic traps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but not transcendently; synthesis feels more calculated than organic; brevity works better for atmosphere than structural complexity.</comment>
