<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's apathy and defiance shape actions but lack emotional depth; motivations hinted at through quiet resolve but insufficiently explored. Dialogue minimal but thematically resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot driven by meteor-following method; cause/effect clear but pacing stumbles during compressed time jumps. Closure achieved but feels slightly compressed for emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush, celestial imagery immerses reader in unique floating monastery setting; sensory details enhance tone but deeper integration of atmospheric elements could strengthen impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid meteor-path concept and atmospheric setting avoid clich√©s; protagonist's naivety and apathy occasionally feel contrived. Language remains focused but lacks distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of core elements (meteor-driven journey, monastery) strengthens narrative, but secondary details (cloth bag's memories) underutilized. Concise structure works but emotional impact feels restrained.</comment>
