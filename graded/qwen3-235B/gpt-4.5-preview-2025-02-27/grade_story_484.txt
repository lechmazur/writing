<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conceptual motivation to embody values is clear, but the character's "unique genericness" remains undefined and underexplored. Actions feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded, with transformation lacking nuanced causal progression. The narration's abstract introspection weakens personal voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The staircase-as-plot-device creates artificial momentum. Protest lull/use juxtaposition lacks narrative integration. Cause-effect between mirror encounter and protest resolution feels forced. Pacing balances eeriness and action, but the tight word limit exposes structural gaps between thematic beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d haunted mansion tropes with scant sensory originality. Protests remain visually/thematically disconnected from graveyard setting. Darkness-as-metaphor lacks concrete environmental integration. The mirror's shattered state could deepen setting-symbolism but remains superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evokes momentary pathos through mirror imagery and protest symbolism, but themes of quiet integrity vs. societal change lack complex interplay. Ending's rallying effect feels narratively convenient rather than emotionally earned. Subtext exists but operates at surface-level metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Over-reliance on haunted house archetypes and ale/fermentation metaphors betrays formulaic thinking. "Flippant solemnity" reads as artificial tone-switching. Broken mirror revelation follows predictable mystical object trope. Sensory details often abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements function as thematic checklist rather than organic narrative drivers. While brevity allows conceptual compression, protest-graveyard connection and staircase motivation strain cohesion. Leaves intellectual impression rather than emotional resonance. Premise overexecution.</comment>
