<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underexplored; the blacksmith interaction leans on clichés rather than organic development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is clear but strained by the sudden forge transition; resolution ties back effectively but feels abbreviated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but unevenly integrated elements (e.g., hospital/forge clash); conceptually ambitious, yet constrained by its brevity.</comment>
