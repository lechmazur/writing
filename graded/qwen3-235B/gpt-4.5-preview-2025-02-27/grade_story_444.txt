<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character displays consistency in motivation but lacks nuanced development beyond thematic symbolism; "fierceness" and "methodically playful" feel stated rather than demonstrated through distinct actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but compressed; the chain of letters drives progression yet resolution feels rushed; cause-effect logic exists but pacing struggles under word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative setting details (corroded walls, algae, static) immerse readers in haunting atmosphere that mirrors thematic tension between illusion and truth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (costume as lost purity, letters as subconscious threads) elevates impact; ending resonates thematically but dialogue/showing of emotions could be deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some poetic passages avoid formulaicity, but overuse of abstract descriptors ("calm frenzy," "methodically playful") risks artificiality; theme execution feels concept-driven over human-nuanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements integrate thematically but with uneven weight; conclusion lingers conceptually yet lacks visceral emotional stakes to elevate beyond intellectual exercise.</comment>
