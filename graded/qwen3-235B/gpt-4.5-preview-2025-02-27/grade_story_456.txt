<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivations are suggested but remain abstract; “morbid florist” and “neutrally passionate” traits lack concrete behavioral manifestations to fully justify their influence on actions or voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear ritualistic arc, but the tight word limit compresses emotional and thematic momentum, leaving pivotal shifts (e.g., acceptance) underdramatized and reliant on narration over action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere through lantern/candle interplay and void imagery is effective, but lacks multisensory immersion—no smell of wax or flora, texture of pages, or physical weight of the dojo’s floating paradox.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric cohesion (candle as life/ritual) and cyclical structure elevate impact, but introspective passages occasionally “tell” cosmic revelations rather than “show” their emotional weight through visceral detail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evokes familiar literary mysticism without subverting tropes; “floating dojo” and cryptic pages lean on genre conventions, while phrases like “baldly timid” border on curated affectation over organic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not indivisible from the story—the florist and dojo feel imposed rather than intrinsic; the ending’s reflective serenity lingers, but thematic ambition outweighs executed depth.</comment>
