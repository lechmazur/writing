<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Underdeveloped motivations and emotional depth; character's crisis feels more logistical than personal, with motivations tied to concepts rather than lived convictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence strained by abrupt resolution; pacing falters between high-stakes labyrinth shifts and quiet card arrangements, with cause/effect logic that hinges on underexplained sacred geometry rules.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere benefits from tactile details (worn cards, radio static) and haunting archive descriptions, but the labyrinthâ€™s "living entity" shift lacks grounded environmental cues.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., labyrinth as responsive entity) and subtext of connection are present but surface-level; emotional resonance undercut by reliance on abstract terms over visceral character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (labyrinth crises, last-minute salvations) dominate; imagery leans on ornate descriptors ("sacred geometry") rather than specificity, with atmospheric details feeling curated rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but lack narrative urgency; the compact structure sacrifices thematic depth, leaving the ending feeling contrived rather than earned.</comment>
