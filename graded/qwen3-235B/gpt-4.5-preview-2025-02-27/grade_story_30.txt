<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks internal conflict; philosophically practical attribute feels underutilized in decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels rushed in critical transitions (e.g., landing to planting trees); ending lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but unevenâ€”space pirate setting and medieval tapestry contrast effectively, yet sensory details remain generic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Originality in blending sci-fi and medieval elements, but relies on predictable tropes (e.g., "last hope" narratives); some purple prose detracts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated but occasionally mechanical; story hints at deeper ideas without fully committing to thematic innovation.</comment>
