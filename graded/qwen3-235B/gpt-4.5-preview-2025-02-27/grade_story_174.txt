<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation (regret) and a transformative arc, but emotional depth feels somewhat surface-level; the pivotal choice between love/fireworks lacks nuanced backstory to make the regret fully resonate.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete (regret → quest → revelation → resolution), but the compressed structure necessitates leaps in logic (e.g., immediate recognition of frost patterns) that strain believability despite poetic intent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (scent of ancient leaves, roaring water) amplify atmosphere; the library’s connection to natural patterns is vivid, though the car-window frost’s sudden significance feels under-primed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (fireworks vs. frost patterns) elegantly mirror thematic tension, and the ending ties the arc together, though emotional impact is dampened by the protagonist’s overly abstract regret.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on "regret redemption" tropes; prose is lyrical without veering into purple, though some phrases (“ephemeral beauty”) risk overfamiliarity; AI fingerprints present in neatly resolved arcs without lingering ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Packs all elements cohesively, though some (frost patterns) strain for symbolic weight. Style prioritizes precision over flourishes, but the concise form feels like a constraint rather than an artistic choice.</comment>
