<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation of seeking divine truth drives actions, including detailed internal conflict and physicality of decoding echoes, but lacks deeper exploration of missionary background; transformation feels somewhat abrupt yet emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows clear transformation arc from doubt to faith, propelled by piano echo decoding, but pacing feels slightly rushed in conveying metaphysical shifts; resolution is satisfying but underdevelops the "conceal" element.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels with visceral sensory details (glass sands, butterfly migrations, piano echoes) creating a cohesive, haunting atmosphere that amplifies isolation and spiritual longing, though piano’s origin remains unexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance via symbolic imagery (tarnished/glowing fork, monarchs as spiritual witnesses) and subtext about faith’s duality; ending feels earned while leaving subtle ambiguity, though some metaphors border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés with unique metaphysical framework but occasionally slips into lyrical excess (“whispering secrets,” “veins of doubt”) that risks detachment; character psychology balances introspection with physicality, though “capriciously consistent” remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically to create memorable metaphysical journey, though tighter integration of “conceal” action and character backstory would enhance cohesion; style mostly purposeful but occasionally prioritizes aesthetics over clarity.</comment>
