<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character has some introspection and subtle internal conflict but lacks distinct voice and fully realized motivation beyond surface-level professional duty; personal struggles are hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear three-part structure with poetic progression; pacing is meditative but risks feeling static; cohesive arc exists but tension/resolution could be more pronounced within limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through candle imagery, cold night air, and tactile metaphors; atmosphere perfectly complements tone and theme without overdescription.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but some feel perfunctory; brief length serves elegiac tone well; concept shows ingenuity but final impact doesn't quite transcend its individual components.</comment>
