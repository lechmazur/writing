<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations like curiosity and self-confrontation are present but surface-level; Elias feels archetypal rather than deeply individualized. The reflection device lacks emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear three-part structure (arrival, penny use, revelation) works within constraints, but transitions feel abrupt (e.g., sudden appearance of reflection). Momentum is logical but lacks tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Polished prose renders moonlit orchard and statues with vivid tactile detail (creaking stone, ghostly fruit). Atmosphere overwhelms character interiority rather than complementing it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical resonance between penny collection and truth-seeking exists. Ending provokes reflection on dream/reality dichotomies, though emotional payoff remains muted beneath lyrical surfaces.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Illuminated apple tree and moon-path imagery avoid clich√©, but plot mechanics (statues as guardians, self-confrontation) follow predictable mystical narrative templates despite polished prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively but lack innovative recombination; brevity suggests intentional scope rather than limitation, though thematic layers remain underexplored.</comment>
