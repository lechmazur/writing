<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lack of organic emotional progression hinders character believability; sudden shifts from apathy to devotion feel unearned despite strong concept. Narration lacks distinct voice to fully embody "apathetically devoted" trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a circular trajectory but struggles with compressed pacing - key transitions (manuscript completion to drive-in discovery) feel rushed or underdeveloped, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion builds atmosphere: rustling leaves, weathered screen, dust-coated booth all create haunting, evocative spaces that mirror emotional states without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean symbolism through visual motifs (vines, rust, silence) but occasionally sacrifices subtlety for explicit thematic explanations; ending feels slightly pat despite strong journal revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some purple-prose tendencies exist (excessive plant consciousness descriptions) but overall maintains stylistic coherence; avoids AI-clich√©s through specific setting details rather than generic supernatural tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Meets basic cohesion requirements but feels more assembled than organically constructed; emotional resonance and thematic potential remain underdeveloped beneath competent craftsmanship.</comment>
