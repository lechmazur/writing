<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Contradictions between Elias's poetic passion and criminal existence are clear but underexplored. His shift from fear to courage feels sudden despite poetic catalyst. Dummy interaction reveals inner conflict, but character voice occasionally veers toward melodrama rather than organic transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Poetry as pivotal action drives plot but stanzas feel overwritten. Connection between beginning theft and ending transformation exists but lacks intermediate development. Machinery magic provides cause-effect, yet pacing alternates between rushed (spirit release) and stagnant (dummy interaction lags).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Haunted engine room's mechanical decay fused with spectral energy creates compelling juxtaposition. "Scorching poise" manifests effectively through oppressive heat. Timeframe between appointments is underutilized. Dummy's connection to transformation theme is strong despite setting feeling overly Gothic rather than uniquely atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors and soul-baring verses resonate thematically. Spirit audience provides satisfactory dramatic tension and emotional payoff. Subtext about artistic authenticity vs. survival is clear. Expository statements like "true transformation required confronting fears" undercut showing potential. Poetry sections occasionally rely on predictable rhythm over visceral imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haunted dummy and lighthouse tropes receive minor subversions but echo familiar genre beats. "Scorching poise" description feels conceptually fresh yet execution borders on pretentious. Some poetic passages risk purple prose through excessive adjectives. Character nuance present in transformation arc but spiritual elements lean toward clich√©.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration demonstrates creativity but uneven execution. Poetic transformation mechanism could work better with tighter word economy. Brief form supports theme of personal epiphany rather than limiting it. Lingering reflection on art's transformative power exists, but pacing issues and overwriting hinder complete cohesion.</comment>
