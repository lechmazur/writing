<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weakly sketched internal conflict; motivations for evasion are underdeveloped despite poetic allusions. The bruised fighter label remains metaphorically superficial without visceral combat history shaping decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure using the chisel strike as framing device works, but key emotional shifts occur without sufficient narrative causality. The lion's activation feels abrupt within the attic's enclosed logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory density in the attic creates immersive tension, but the sculptor timeframe lacks integration beyond serving as arbitrary inciting incident rather than intrinsic temporal motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors about self-deception resonate thematically, but relies excessively on explicit thematic statements ("Stand firm...") rather than organic character revelation through action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains ornate abstractions ("whispering dust," "kinship with machine") that verge on affectation. Emotional resonance diluted by heavy-handed symbolic exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but lack revelatory synthesis – feels conceptually ambitious yet execution remains at surface-level metaphor without transcendent narrative or linguistic breakthrough.</comment>
