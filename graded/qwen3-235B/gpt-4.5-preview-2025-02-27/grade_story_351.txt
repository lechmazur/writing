<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth in exploring how his rebellious past shapes his current actions; reactions to objects lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but feels compressed; the inciting incident (breaking the seal) and resolution (writing poems) lack emotional buildup and consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (ivy, brass sundial) create immersive atmosphere; settingâ€™s decay mirrors the theme of forgotten lives but could deepen symbolic connection to time.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor ("delicate undoing of silence") and subtext about memory; resolution feels purposeful but some emotional beats are told, not shown (e.g., "profound resonance").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elegantly written but occasionally slips into ornate prose ("patient grace," "quiet intensity"); metaphors are fresh, but character reasoning leans on poetic abstraction over human-specific nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated but feel occasionally formulaic (e.g., "forgotten souls" trope); story lingers thematically but lacks narrative urgency that might elevate its message.</comment>
