<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to seek unfiltered experience lacks psychological depth; his transformation through fragmented subtitles feels imposed rather than earned through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through arbitrary juxtaposition of elements (TV in palace, recipe, photo) rather than organic causality; symbolic resolution feels contrived despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting relies on superficial exoticism with minimal sensory immersion; anachronistic TV disrupts rather than enhances atmosphere; inconsistent tone between historical and absurdist elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Themes of storytelling's power are stated overtly rather than shown through action; metaphors (recipe = life, fading photo = fear) lack subtlety or layered meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate descriptors ("fretful archer," "daring caution") and formulaic symbolic resolution suggest artificial construction; emotional resonance feels manufactured rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but executionally uneven; elements coexist without achieving synergistic cohesion required for prestigious publication quality.</comment>
