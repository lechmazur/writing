<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to confront doubt is clear, but interiority lacks depth; actions align with traits but emotional resonance feels derived rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear arc from paralysis to redemption is coherent within the word limit, but underdeveloped tension between internal doubt and external action weakens plot momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent fungi and mushroom architecture create an immersive, surreal atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's psychological state through precise, otherworldly sensory detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors and symbolic resonance of the prism's light elevate the narrative, though the theme of self-acceptance skims profundity without piercing deeper emotional strata.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>While the mushroom setting avoids clich√©, overreliance on melancholic introspection and overly polished imagery occasionally veers into poetic sterility rather than visceral originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but cautiously; the prism and doubt metaphor interlace effectively, though some choices (e.g., voicemails) feel utilitarian rather than imaginatively integral.</comment>
