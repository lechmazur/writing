<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks depth in emotional evolution; the sea glass symbolism is present but underdeveloped, and the transition from grief to resolve feels abrupt without internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is linear but lacks rising tension or stakes; decoding microfilm progresses the plot efficiently, though the resolution feels perfunctory without meaningful obstacles or consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends grit and cosmic wonder effectively, but sensory details are limited to sight and sound; the observatory's setting supports the theme but feels underexplored spatially.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (sea glass, black hole) carry thematic weight, but emotional resonance is diluted by heavy "telling"; the ending resolves the immediate goal but bypasses deeper exploration of transformation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality in merging speculative elements with eco-mourning themes; avoids overt clich√©s but relies on "lone trapper" trope without subversion, and "silently audible" risks poetic excess without narrative function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack interdependence: sea glass and observatory serve symbolic roles but could be more causally tied to the plot; theme is consistent but not deeply interrogated.</comment>
