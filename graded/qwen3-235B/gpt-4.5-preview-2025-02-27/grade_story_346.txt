<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks consistent motivation; while his emptiness is shown, the transition from "boastful warrior" to breakdown feels abrupt and under-explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but constrained by word limit; the climax feels rushed despite the surreal momentum leading up to it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Story is cohesive in theme and tone but struggles with pacing and forced symbolic juxtapositions, weakening its publishability.</comment>
