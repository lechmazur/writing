<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and thematically consistent, but Elias' interiority remains underdeveloped beyond his trauma and symbolic actions. His "dizzyingly grounded" realization lacks psychological depth, and the first-person narration absent despite his reconstructive acts suggesting deeper introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates coherent progression with strong beginning/middle/end, but the accelerated transformation of plants responding to him feels undercontextualized. The carbonizing climax effectively resolves his arc, though some tonal shifts between isolation and revelation lack transitional nuance within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details like the "dim glow of a single lamp" and "rustling leaves" create an immersive, contemplative atmosphere. The greenhouse setting effectively mirrors Elias' internal growth, though the discarded masks' symbolic connection to the timeframe (jigsaw puzzles) feels less integrated spatially.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Symbolism (masks, mirror, carbonization) powerfully conveys themes of fragmentation and renewal. The ending avoids trite resolution by embracing paradoxical belonging. Subtext about constructed identity is strong, though emotional impact is occasionally diluted by faintly didactic phrasing in the epiphany scene.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic structures; the intersection of desertion, botanical research, and mask restoration feels inventive. Language remains precise without elaboration, though occasional phrases like "noble foolishness" risk abstraction over embodied meaning. Character logic prioritizes thematic resonance over psychological complexity but with intentional design.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified whole where each detail supports theme or character. The abbreviated form works as a compressed character study rather than limitation. Emotional resonance emerges subtly through gesture rather than declaration, leaving lingering questions about identity as both rejection and rebirth.</comment>
