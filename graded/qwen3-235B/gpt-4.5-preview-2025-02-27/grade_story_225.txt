<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation ties to butterflies and Morse code, but the apothecary background remains underexplored; emotional reactions to the pen and messages are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc (doubt → resolution) and uses Morse signals effectively, but the word limit strains the transition from hesitation to reaffirmation; pacing is uneven in emotional beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (sapphire currents, humming machinery) create immersive steampunk atmosphere; the "battered marvel" tone aligns with themes of resilience but occasionally relies on familiar tropes (sunlit butterflies as hope symbols).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Butterfly symbolism and highlighter-as-metaphor deepen themes; ending resonates conceptually but leans on stated emotions ("infected his heart") rather than fully shown subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés in setting but slips into ornate descriptions ("battered marvels of machinery") and predictable emotional beats; the apothecary premise and submarine setting show originality, but the love theme feels conventionally resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not tightly interconnected; some feel imposed (e.g., "unjustly fair") while the butterflies and Morse code drive the narrative; ending lingers conceptually but lacks visceral emotional impact.</comment>
