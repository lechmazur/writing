<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but internal conflict remains slightly surface-level; 'reservedly bold' trait is stated rather than consistently demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression feels logical but slightly rushed; the historians' role lacks concrete stakes or payoff within the word limit, slightly weakening the narrative frame.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visually evocative sensory details (neon's hum, mask's pulse) but setting's thematic connection to the character's guilt and the mask's function could be tighter and more immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (labyrinthine carvings mirroring guilt) but emotional resonance leans heavily on descriptive abstraction rather than layered subtext or humanizing details.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality undermined by overused tropes (redemptive warrior, mystical tribal artifact); phrasing veers into ornate clich√©s ("flooded mind," "seamlessly melding") undercutting freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</degree><comment>Cohesion is functional but not exceptional; many elements (rosebush timeframe, neon shop) feel decoratively atmospheric rather than organically integral to the character's arc.</comment>
