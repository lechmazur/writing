<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underexplored; the outlaw poet persona is atmospheric but lacks depth in how their poetic rebellion tangibly shaped past events or inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence within constraints, but the transition from reading walls to the destiny realization feels slightly rushed despite effective cause-effect linking of dice rolls and text responses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details (gears, steam, coffee scent) and brass-and-copper architecture create a vivid steampunk atmosphere that meaningfully reinforces themes of mechanical precision and shifting fate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ezra's final epiphany about intertwined destinies provides emotional resonance; symbolism of misaligned text mirrors thematic ambiguity, though some deeper subtext about poetry's real-world impact remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Contains evocative imagery but occasionally slips into ornate description ("saturated with stars," "fluidity of fate") that feels more stylistic default than intentional voice, slightly diluting originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively with minor friction; the steampunk setting and shifting walls particularly enhance narrative momentum, though some required components (rehearsal timeframe) feel conceptually thinner than others.</comment>
