<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivations are implied but not deeply explored; reactions to the bottle reveal thematic conflict but lack psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strained by compressed arc; pacing feels rushed during the thematic epiphany; action drives the narrative but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere and sensory details (e.g., "gnarled roots snaked between bones") are evocative but occasionally overwrought; setting enhances tone without full integration into character decisions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Themes are transparent but lack subtext; ending feels predictable; symbolism (empty bottle as doubt) is effective yet derivative; writing style leans into repetitive poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Relies on mystical stranger tropes and clich√©d symbolism; metaphors verge on "purple prose"; fails to subvert expectations or demonstrate distinctive authorial voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not exceptional; cohesive but not groundbreaking; tone is consistent but lacks innovation; resolution feels obligatory rather than earned.</comment>
