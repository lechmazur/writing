<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear through symbolic actions (chopstick, tea leaves) but dialogue lacks distinct voice; "irate" manifests briefly in guarded moments but deeper nuance needed for full dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence maintained through strong symbolic arc but pacing feels occasionally rushed in key emotional transitions; jogging as timeframe device clever but underdeveloped connection to meditation ritual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (rusted starships, swirling tea leaves) beautifully create desolate yet hopeful atmosphere; setting/timeframe interplay provides excellent thematic support for character reckoning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Symbolism (waterfalls = redemption) and layered metaphors (tea patterns = fate) create strong emotional resonance; show-don't-tell maintained with exception of some "heart's revolt" tell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept blending sci-fi and introspection avoids major tropes but some phrases ("heart's revolt") lean toward poetic abstraction rather than unique insight; emotional subtext mostly nuanced but occasionally explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively creating lingering thematic weight; brief format serves narrative purpose; story lingers with questions about redemption pathways rather than tidy resolutions.</comment>
