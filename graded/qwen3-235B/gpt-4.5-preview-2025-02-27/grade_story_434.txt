<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has clear motivation tied to artifact and ancestral duty, but lacks depth beyond archetypal "lone guardian" with insufficient nuance in emotional or psychological development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc but resolution feels rushed, particularly the sudden mastery of flame dance as a defense mechanism without believable progression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story achieves atmospheric cohesion but struggles with integrating assigned elements organically, particularly the abstract "commonly individual" attribute.</comment>
