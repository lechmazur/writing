<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's meekness inconsistently informs actions; motivation to harness heartbreak is abstract but drives narrative, though emotional depth lacks nuance in reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot has emotional arc but minimal structural tension; pacing uneven in establishing cause-effect relationships within word constraints, particularly in Elias' internal transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Underwater setting vivid but superficially developed; "luminous regret" tone permeates descriptions but sensory details lack specificity to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., heartbreak as fuel) and symbolic sculpture resonate thematically; ending balances melancholy and hope but risks sentimentality; subtext about collective sorrow is impactful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is original but relies on melancholic clich√©s; language occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing ("time's final ripple") that feels decorative rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack narrative urgency; story works better as reflective vignette than a plot-driven piece; themes linger but emotional payoff remains muted.</comment>
