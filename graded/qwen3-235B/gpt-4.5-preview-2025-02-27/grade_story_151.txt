<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (logical morality) remains consistent, but human nuance in his emotional conflict appears underdeveloped. While the veil and idol interactions symbolize abstract ideas, they lack visceral connection to personal stakes or relatable vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The snowflake method drives the plot conceptually, but its execution feels abstract rather than narratively active. The arc (astronomer’s discovery → conflict → resolution) works within constraints, though causal links between ethical insights and physical actions remain thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ice floes, lighthouse orchard, and crystal shadows create an evocative, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details (cracking ice, snowflake patterns) immerse readers, though the idol’s sudden presence strains consistency with the world’s established emotional numbness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (veil, snowflakes, idol) and lyrical prose elevate thematic depth, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction. The ending’s awe feels earned thematically yet underdeveloped in embodied narrative—more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by clichéd phrasing (“infinite tapestry of stars”) and overly ornate descriptions (“crystal shadows”). While snowflake symbolism avoids trope, character’s abrupt emotional revival risks artificiality. The theme feels human-wrought but edges toward poetic abstraction’s pitfalls.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The story’s thematic ambition and symbolic density create lingering resonance, but integration of elements (idol, veil, timeframe) occasionally feels strained by word limitations. Ideas outweigh character/fleshed narrative, though brevity does not fully negate its poetic cohesion.</comment>
