<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization is clear but thinly drawn; motivation tied to betrayal is consistent but lacks nuance, and the 'brazen raider' trait isn't fully embodied through actions or decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structural coherence is passable, but pacing feels rushed in critical emotional beats; the connection between social upheaval and the lab’s relevance remains underdeveloped despite tight word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details (e.g., corroded machinery, watery silence), but the timeframe’s social upheaval feels disconnected rather than enhancing the lab’s isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (charcoal, superstition) and emotional subtext in gestures outweighs somewhat predictable thematic arcs; ending resolves tension but lacks lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Leverages familiar tropes (genius in exile) with minor subversions (charcoal symbol’s personal weight), but moments of emotional resonance are undercut by generic descriptions of ‘regret’ or ‘hope’.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive narrative, but some (social upheaval) feel perfunctory; the brief length serves atmosphere but limits deeper exploration of themes or character.</comment>
