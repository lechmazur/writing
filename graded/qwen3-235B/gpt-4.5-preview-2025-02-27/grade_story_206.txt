<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is logically connected to parental loss and hidden legacy, but emotional depth feels superficial. Sudden shifts from artist to rebel leader lack psychological nuance. Personality traits like "precisely creative" manifest through sugar sculptures but aren't meaningfully challenged or evolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but stumbles under word constraints - critical transitions between locket discovery, photo trail, secret compartment, and counterattack feel rushed. Cause-effect chain works mechanistically but lacks organic pacing. The "hidden continent" revelation resolves the central conflict yet feels under-developed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory decay of the "crumbling stalls" and "amber/violet twilight" painting a vivid rebellious mood. The market setting meaningfully connects to both character backstory and resistance activity. Tarnished locket and faded photographs reinforce the "forgotten" theme through tangible symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story creates emotional resonance through symbolic sugar sculptures, but relies excessively on exposition over showing. Metaphors work effectively (sugar as fragile hope, continent as forbidden knowledge) but aren't fully explored. The ending achieves thematic resolution (rebellion/voyage) without over-explaining, though character arc feels incomplete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps through specific imagery (tarnished initials, splintered stall wood) but contains traces of formulaic structure - rebellion arc follows predictable revolutionary tropes. Emotional cues occasionally default to explicit labeling ("burning desire") rather than nuanced subtext. Candy-sculpting as resistance method adds sufficient originality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concept elements mostly serve narrative cohesion, though some feel forced (regime's fear of geographical knowledge lacks plausibility). Brief format sacrifices depth for breadth - hidden continent's symbolic weight carries the story but strains believability. Concludes with emotional weight and thematic closure but remains constrained by its tightly packed components.</comment>
