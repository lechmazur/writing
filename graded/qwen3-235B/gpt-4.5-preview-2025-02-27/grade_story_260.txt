<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength in tying obsession to actions, but underdevelops motivations behind his "indefinitely absolute belief" and personal connection to reconciliation. Reactions to objects remain surface-level symbolic gestures rather than emotionally resonant choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong causal chain between rewriting and spectral resolution, but pacing rushes the general’s transformation. The tight word limit sacrifices broader context about the "whisper collection point" that would strengthen the arc’s emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like "hollow eyes searching" and the humming collection point create eerie immersion, but the "noble chaos” tone lacks subtext—whispers remain abstract rather than evoking specific griefs. Sensory overdescription occasionally muffles emotional intimacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (key ring as redemption) resonate, but the ending leans on sentimentalism over earned emotion. The theme of historical revisionism’s moral weight emerges too late to deepen the conflict—conflict remains externalized rather than interrogating Elias’ godlike authority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Originality in the premise wanes through predictable "haunted scribe" tropes and overly ornate phrasing ("noble chaos"). Subtext about rewriting history lacks nuance—Elias’ power feels arbitrary rather than philosophically grounded. Purple prose ("seeds of reconciliation proliferate") occasionally erodes authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but lack symbiotic depth—crossword creator role feels tacked onto diary-rewriting method. The brevity suits the ethereal tone but hinders character complexity. Theme lingers faintly rather than haunting readers through subtext.</comment>
