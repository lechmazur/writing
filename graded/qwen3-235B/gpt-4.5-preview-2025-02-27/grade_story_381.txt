<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters show slight depth through symbolic objects (cap, movies) but necromancer aspect remains underexplored. Dialogue reveals shared nostalgia but lacks internal conflict or growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a simple arc of mapping to completion, but lacks tension or stakes. Pacing is steady yet feels static. Connection between beginning and end is present but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Crystalline cave employs vivid, specific sensory descriptions that enhance mood. The contrast between sterile futuristic cities and organic cave resonates thematically, though some worldbuilding elements (necromancy) remain unexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Storytelling excels through poetic metaphors ("crystalline acoustics") and dialogue-driven theme exploration. Emotional impact is subtle but genuine. Lacks structural boldness to match literary pretensions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps but relies on nostalgic tropes without subverting them. Baseball cap symbolism and cave-as-character concept show ingenuity, while necromancer identity feels like superficial worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally cohere around shared nostalgia motif, though some (like necromancy) feel disconnected. Brevity serves atmospheric goals well but undermines character/plot depth. Style neither hinders nor elevates sufficiently.</comment>
