<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underexplored; the "singularly multiple" attribute feels appended rather than integral to Elias's identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but relies on contrived action (shoelace incident), with resolution feeling rushed despite thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setting evokes atmosphere but lacks full sensory integration; the fern's role feels symbolically heavy-handed without organic depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and theme of doubt/belief cycle elevate the story, but emotional resonance relies on overgeneralized aphorisms in the conclusion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional purple prose ("graceless beauty") and mechanical transitions; thematic ambition outweighs execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive in concept but uneven in execution; forced moments (e.g., violin-string simile) undermine its intellectual elegance.</comment>
