<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent (zealot assassin’s duality shown via Echo interaction) and motivations are coherent, but lacks deeper exploration of psychological complexity beneath the theatrical persona.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Structure adheres to constraints with clear beginning/middle/end, but plot momentum stalls in middle sections; tension between moral ambiguity and narrative resolution feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid coral imagery creates visual atmosphere, but underutilized sensory details (e.g., water resistance, marine sounds) limit full immersion; setting functions as backdrop rather than active participant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors about perspective are effective but over-explained; the "reversed echoes" motif shows conceptual brilliance yet lacks deeper integration into narrative mechanics or character psychology.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés through unique setting and themes, but some phrases ("shimmering waves") and the plush dolphin trope veer toward sentimentality; emotional nuance occasionally sacrificed for thematic emphasis.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Idea leaves lingering questions about morality, but reliance on explicit thematizing undermines subtlety; elements are cohesively arranged but rarely surprise beyond their initial conceptual layer.</comment>
