<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character shows clear arc but feels sketchy - submissive traits conflict with sudden heroism without enough development. Assigned traits influence actions but inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence with clear beginning/middle/end, though eavesdropping mechanism feels forced. Pacing is generally effective within the constrained format.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Secret agent workshop feels jarringly anachronistic in aristocratic estate. Sensory details present but somewhat inconsistent - atmosphere supports some elements but not all.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional response, but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Central theme of quiet courage emerges but subtext remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Frequent purple prose detracts ("words liquifying into whispers," "tension liquifying into trust"). Dialogue feels artificial. Story follows predictable template with minimal twist.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements feel incorporated for requirement rather than narrative purpose. Story lacks cohesion - aristocratic setting and secret agent workshop remain tonally disconnected.</comment>
