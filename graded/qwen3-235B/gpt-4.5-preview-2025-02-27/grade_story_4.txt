<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's playful nature feels underdeveloped and inconsistently applied; motivations for mapping sacred spaces lack emotional grounding despite divine connections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels slightly compressed; pacing slows during ritualistic descriptions, diluting momentum in critical emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details create a vivid, haunting atmosphere; however, integration of "endless night" and "filing" timeframe remains underexplored thematically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolic use of music as divine communication; thematic cohesion between playfulness and sacred duty falters in emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional overwrought metaphors ("borrowed starlight") and moments of predictable mysticism; avoids major clich√©s but risks ornate detachment.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements combine with mechanical competence but lack revelatory synergy; the story succeeds as a poetic fragment rather than a cohesive, market-defining work.</comment>
