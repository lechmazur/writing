<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lord Elias' melancholy and recklessness are established but underexplored; his transformation through ticket stubs feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally grounded, though the core motivation to dismantle illusions connects consistently.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from fragmented introspection to resolution, but the combustion lab's thematic connection to Elias' internal collapse feels superficial; pacing is deliberate but occasionally rushed in conveying emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrast between the drone's precision and the lab's charred decay effectively mirrors Elias' psyche, though the setting’s symbolic potential is underutilized beyond surface parallels.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Successfully employs ticket stubs and the drone as metaphors for memory and clarity; the ending is resolute but lacks lingering ambiguity, while deeper themes of complicity are hinted but not fully dissected.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing (e.g., "mysteriously obvious") and overly deliberate descriptions occasionally veer into artifice; emotional depth is shown more than told, but some elements (lab’s history) feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</question><grade>Most elements are serviceable and interconnected, but the combustion lab and timeframe between texts feel contrived; the drone and ticket stubs elevate the narrative with inventive symbolism.</grade>
