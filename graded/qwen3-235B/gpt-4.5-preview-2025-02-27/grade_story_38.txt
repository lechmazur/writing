<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and tied to backstory, but inner conflict resolution feels compressed. The insomnia and guilt drive actions effectively, though emotional depth could be richer.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with circular framing (subway stops), but transformation and key revelations feel rushed. Pacing uneven in places, despite logical cause-and-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (smudges, whispers, wilted roses), but the "haunted attic" leans on familiar tropes without sufficient subversion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (botanical samples as resilience symbols) and thematic coherence. The ending resolves the central conflict but occasionally veers into abstraction that dilutes impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on emotionally resonant yet familiar arcs (redemption through art). Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic. Dialogue is purposeful yet stylized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>All elements contribute to a thematically unified whole, though some (e.g., drunken confessions) feel less organic. The story's philosophical message lingers despite minor structural compression.</comment>
