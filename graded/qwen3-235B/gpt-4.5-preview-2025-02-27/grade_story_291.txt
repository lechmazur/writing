<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weak voice and underdeveloped internal conflict. Motivation stated but not fully dramatized through action. Reaction to rope/prejudice remains surface-level despite symbolic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Formulaic circular structure (returning to entrance) lacks surprise. Cosmic echoes device allows plot progression without earned tension. Pacing uneven between atmospheric setup and abrupt resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptionally vivid decay in mirror maze contrasts with ethereal wilderness. Dying tree/sleeping cat add haunting temporal texture. Atmosphere outshines narrative execution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rope motif and mirror symbolism work powerfully. Subtext about ongoing struggle against prejudice resonates. "Calculated wilderness" evokes complex theme of self-determination beyond binary choices.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids most genre clich√©s but strained cosmic elements border on purple prose. "Deliberately accidental" concept feels intellectualized rather than organically embodied in character choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than average but rely heavily on atmospheric compensation for streamlined emotional beats. Premise's philosophical questions linger long after thin character portrayal fades.</comment>
