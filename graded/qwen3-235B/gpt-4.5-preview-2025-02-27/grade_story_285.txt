<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strength in linking physical awkwardness to internal conflict, but motivation lacks psychological depth; resolve feels abrupt without sufficient prior struggle texture.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc is complete but compressed, with the hermit crab lesson resolving doubt too tidily; pacing uneven, with geothermal vent symbolism feeling tacked onto conclusion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frost/fire juxtaposition is vivid and thematically resonant, with specific details (steam hissing, crab shells) grounding the surrealism; atmosphere occasionally over-decorated without narrative purpose.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (shells, postcard) and subtext about tradition vs. complacency engage intellectually; emotionally distant narration reduces impact of "awkward courage" arc; ending satisfies but lacks ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids generic descriptors and clich√©s with unique imagery (e.g., frozen orchard), but hermit crabs as didactic device border on allegory; tone occasionally over-explains rather than implying.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric cohesion, though some elements (geothermal vents, postcard) feel included rather than inevitable; theme of vulnerability in adaptation lingers, but stakes lack grit.</comment>
