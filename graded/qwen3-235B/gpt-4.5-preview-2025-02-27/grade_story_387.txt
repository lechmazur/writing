<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character is underdeveloped; selflessness stated rather than demonstrated through conflict or nuance. Motivation is conceptually clear but lacks human dimension. Musician aspect feels incidental rather than shaping actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Basic three-act structure exists but lacks complexity within constraints. Cause/effect relationship between wind chime alignment and breakthrough feels externally imposed. Pacing remains linear but predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting details like recycled spaceship create vivid atmosphere. Tonal elements exist but 'savage grace' description lacks grounding in concrete imagery. Sensory integration is inconsistent in depth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Successfully evokes emotional resonance through symbolic imagery. Subtext about legacy vs. preservation is present. Some purple prose tendencies undercut impact. Theme of unity through imperfection is effectively conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Combines unusual elements (vinyl record as data source) but falls into familiar "solitary savior" trope. Some ornate descriptions verge on purple prose. Metaphors occasionally ring hollow through overuse. Personality insights feel surface-level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are all present but integration varies. Style balances poetic and functional, but occasionally sacrifices clarity. Length feels limiting rather than purposeful. Leaves thematic questions but lacks deep emotional anchoring.</comment>
