<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking balance, code-word rituals) is clear but underdeveloped; the feral ranger's past life and emotional stakes remain superficial, reducing psychological depth. Actions align with traits but lack visceral specificity</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure hinges on symbolic gestures rather than causal progression; the newborn's cry framing device creates cohesion, but lacks dramatic tension. Pacing is static, relying on metaphor over event</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative atmosphere through sensory details (golden hues, quivering seeds, scent of earth) creates immersive melancholy. The dandelion field and dawn setting enhance thematic resonance of transience and balance</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic craft (balance scale, code words, seeds) and lyrical metaphors elevate impact. Theme of embracing chaos vs. control emerges clearly. Emotional payoff feels intellectualized rather than visceral</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Imagery avoids clich√© but edges toward ornate abstraction ("hopeful melancholy"). Character's logic feels engineered for thematic purposes rather than human complexity. Some phrases ("raw perception") risk vagueness</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Cohesion marred by forced integration of assigned elements (code-word receipts). Strong tonal unity and poetic language elevate craft, but narrative momentum suffers from lack of concrete stakes or transformation</comment>
