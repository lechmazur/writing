<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack nuanced emotional depth; Elias’s actions are consistent with his curiosity and guilt, but his internal conflict remains superficially sketched despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot mechanics hinge on fantastical elements (interconnected wishes) that strain internal logic; pacing is uneven, with rushed reconciliation undercutting the emotional gravity of a decades-long rift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visually rich but shallow—nano-scale details feel decorative rather than integral; atmosphere leans heavily on vague "regret" and "warmth" without anchoring sensory specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant prose evokes melancholy and redemption through imagery (fractured mask as metaphor for guilt), but emotional beats are occasionally stated rather than dramatized (e.g., "cautious hope").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting and wish mechanics border on clichéd fantasy tropes; the plague mask’s symbolic weight is original, but the "nano-city" reads as a superficial aesthetic choice over narrative necessity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story hangs together thematically but relies on overly neat resolutions; the core metaphor (mending broken things) is compelling, though execution veers toward sentimentalism over raw complexity.</comment>
