<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fidgeting and musical ineptness inform anxiety but underexploit deeper motivations; emotional reactions are shown but not fully explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear progression from ritual preparation to climax, but pacing veers between rushed and overly descriptive; logical gaps in shadow chaos mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory contrast decay and renewal beautifully; single-star motif inconsistently utilized beyond initial symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (keys as failures) and theme of imperfect creation shine, but predictable emotional beats undercut subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids clich√© through unusual combinations (industrial ruins + magical melody), though some flowery descriptions border on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock tightly (keys, notes, lavender field), yet thematic depth feels clipped by word constraints rather than deliberate brevity.</comment>
