<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Barely avoids being archetypal; motivations hinted but underexplored, interactions lack emotional nuance. Elias's "grandiose modesty" undermines depth, Mirabel's transformation too passive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Well-paced but unambitious three-act structure in tight space; Elias's bottle ritual clearly drives plot, but recycling facility's symbolic role feels appended rather than organic to narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Recycling facility provides effective metaphorical backdrop; float tea platform's whimsy risks whimsy fatigue. Atmospheric details uneven - music and shimmering spirits work, tea tastes are curiously absent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Melody-as-memory metaphor offers thematic cohesion; "showing" through visual rippling/lingering static works better than explicit statements. Ending's emotional payoff too pat despite elegant imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphoric connections (soul-brokering as real estate, reversed labels as key). Some poetic overwriting ("hauntingly beautiful harmonies") but inventive use of ethereal physics redeems.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Barely escapes "conceptual art" criticism; assigned elements mostly interwoven with purpose. Tone inconsistency undermines unity, but metaphysical economy and thematic throughline provide sufficient cohesion for published work.</comment>
