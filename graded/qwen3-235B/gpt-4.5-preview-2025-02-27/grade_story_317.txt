<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arlo’s nostalgia and resolution are established, but his synthetic psychology lacks deeper exploration. Motivation aligns with actions, but emotional layers feel surface-driven by human-centric logic rather than unique android perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but pacing of Arlo’s technical solution feels compressed. Transition from problem to resolution lacks intermediate tension. Dawn-to-dawn symmetry is effective but predictable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid sensory details (colors, fizzing sound), and the levitation facility’s fragility enhances tension. Connection between setting and emotional stakes could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elicits admiration for Arlo’s resolve, but deeper subtext about betrayal or synthetic humanity remains underdeveloped. Ending is satisfying but lacks lingering ambiguity. Literary devices are competent but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Some tropes (solitary caretaker, crystal threat) lean on genre conventions, but tying crystals to betrayal cycles adds freshness. Descriptions avoid excess but occasionally default to generic terms. Emotion is shown but occasionally leans on stated motivations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, with the levitation facility and crystals anchoring the narrative. Dawn’s inclusion feels thematically integral, but the word limit limits deeper interplay between elements like “brazen modesty” and core conflicts.</comment>
