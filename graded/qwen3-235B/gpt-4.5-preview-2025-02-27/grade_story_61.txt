<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but interiority lacks depth; "timidly bold" is shown but not fully fleshed into nuanced human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing strains under brevity but achieves a coherent arc; cause-effect (ritual → cosmic rupture) logically executed, though the invention's role feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie, vividly rendered setting with strong sensory texture, but "organized disorder" remains more decorative than thematically integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (spores as stardust, journal dissolution) resonate; ending avoids trite resolution but stumbles into oversimplified thematic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction ("cosmic hush"); emotional beats are felt rather than overly stated, though some phrasing borders on conceptual vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements interlock with mixed efficacy—wind chimes and fungal orchard excel, while dream journal feels contrived; thematic cohesion is partial but memorable.</comment>
