<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but emotional depth feels superficial; the archer's internal conflict lacks nuanced exploration despite strong thematic setup with compassionate legacy versus forbidden knowledge.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent and tightly compressed, but some transitions (e.g., visions from the fork) feel abrupt; the paper airplane's descent as a temporal marker is clever but strains cause-effect logic slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually rich atmosphere with decayed amusement park/colosseum imagery, but underutilized sensory details (sound/touch) weaken immersion; setting's symbolic weight outpaces physical tangible details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolic interplay of leaves/fork/airplane with theme of relinquishing knowledge; some telling ("understanding now that true legacy...") dilutes emotional impact of showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evasively poetic prose occasionally veers into excessive ornamentation; avoids major clich√©s but archer's internal monologue occasionally feels generically philosophical rather than character-specific.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive as a moral fable but lacks distinctive authorial voice; constrained length works for conceptual impact but sacrifices deeper character exploration.</comment>
