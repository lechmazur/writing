<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation as a cook-turned-truth-seeker lacks organic connection to his professional identity; traits like "frantic tranquility" feel superficially applied without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot demonstrates clear arc but rushed pacing undermines emotional weight; cause/effect between analyzing notches and the facility's collapse feels abrupt rather than earned through sustained tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory details (dust, flickering bulbs, aged objects) but underutilizes setting-specific opportunities to integrate the protagonist's role as a cook.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Raised intriguing philosophical questions about control and truth, but ending relies on clich√©d sacrificial reveal rather than subverting expectations with thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Contains moments of originality (orchestrated earthquakes) but exhibits AI-typical overreliance on atmospheric doom loops and underdeveloped character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Story hangs together thematically but shows strain from element overload; shorter length exacerbates rather than enhances narrative focus.</comment>
