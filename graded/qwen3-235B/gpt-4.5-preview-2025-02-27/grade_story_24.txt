<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character has some internal conflict and warmth, but motivations tied to dentures and reconciliation feel underexplored. Reactions to objects/traits lack psychological depth beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within tight word count, but the apologetic text subplot feels rushed. Pacing veers between lingering descriptions and abrupt emotional shifts. Concept shapes plot but resolution lacks narrative tension resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Richly realized labyrinthine setting with immersive sensory details, though seedy bars receive less spatial specificity. Atmosphere powerfully supports themes through candlelit warmth vs. emotional coldness contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance through puppet symbolism and silent drama. Effective use of metaphor (dentures as legacy, puppets as emotional surrogates), but ending leans on "labyrinthine heart" cliche. Subtext about art’s redemptive power compellingly layered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but has AI-esque tendencies toward ornate descriptors ("dentures rumored to belong to the legendary poet"). Emotional arcs feel slightly algorithmic in their symmetry, lacking unpredictable human complexity in character reasoning.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but unevenly integrate - dentures feel more decorative than structurally essential. Brief length enhances intimacy but sacrifices deeper exploration of key themes. Leaves lingering thematic questions more than concrete emotional impact.</comment>
