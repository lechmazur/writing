<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is consistent in motivation and actions, though depth could be deeper; her grace and determination drive the narrative but lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from ritual to rebellion; the postcards as plot devices are effective, though the rapid resolution risks feeling rushed despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through sensory details (fog, soot, scent of blossoms) that deepen the mood of decay and resurgence, though the fog’s retreat feels slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Persistent themes of absurd hope and defiance create emotional resonance; strong use of symbolism with the forge and postcards, though some subtextual layers could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fresh concept avoids most clichés but leans slightly on poetic vagueness; descriptive language is vivid without descending into overt purple prose, though pacing hiccups occur.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; the concise form feels intentional, with the postcards and forge serving as resonant symbols, though some connections could be tighter.</comment>
