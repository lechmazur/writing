<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's hesitation and duality are present but underexplored; motivations lack psychological depth despite symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Begins strongly but resolution feels abrupt; pivotal choice lacks gradual emotional buildup, weakening narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistently rendered; "savage serenity" concept diluted by vague sensory descriptions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor enrich themes, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; ending achieves thematic closure without genuine catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s; some abstract descriptions verge on purple prose, but unique elements (chamber, compass) suggest intentional, non-formulaic design.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements coexist but aren't fully integrated; prose style is competent but derivative; brevity sacrifices character and tonal development.</comment>
