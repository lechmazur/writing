<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is partially achieved through symbolic objects, but motivations lack sufficient depth and nuance; emotional growth feels summarized rather than organically depicted through specific actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot has a clear structure but resolution feels abrupt; the "coded angles" method lacks plausibility within the brief word limit, creating narrative gaps that hinder cohesion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but uneven execution prevents full realization; brevity sacrifices developmental depth while retaining conceptual sophistication.</comment>
