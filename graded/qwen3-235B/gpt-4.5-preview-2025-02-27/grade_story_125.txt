<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation emerges through interaction with the doll, but emotional depth remains uneven. The "trap on limitations" lacks concrete psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear plot arc but strained by compressed pacing. The discovery-to-awakening transition feels abrupt despite logical cause-effect. Premise demands slower unraveling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere evokes decay through sensory fragments (flickering monitors, dust) but setting remains underdeveloped. Spatial geography unclear. Timeframe element superficially attached.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clever use of doll as heritage conduit and metaphor. Ending feels slightly pat; inherited power's cost unexamined. Effective symbolism elevates otherwise familiar redemption arc.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some awkward phrasing ("bored excitement," "mediocrity tinged with discovery") betrays artificial construction. Emotional progression feels imposed rather than earned. Environmental details occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><grade>Ambitious synthesis compromised by execution. Elements present but unevenly integrated - station's purpose unclear, farmland motif irrelevant. Premise hints at deeper themes but undercuts impact through brevity.</grade>
