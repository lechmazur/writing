<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict with envy is clear, but transformation feels expedited; motivations align with actions but emotional depth could be richer.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but pacing feels rushed; the fingerprint method connects to resolution but introduces causal leaps within tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vivid visuals (honey walls, coloring sessions) immerse readers, but the human-origin ruler clashes with the beehive setting, undermining coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (fingerprints as connection) and symbolism (ruler's imperfection), but emotional beats often rely on stated feelings rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains predictable character dynamics; some sensory details are generic (e.g., "amber-lit"), and tone shifts feel slightly uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are used intentionally but not seamlessly; the narrative achieves thematic closure within the word limit but lacks lingering resonance due to underexplored subtext.</comment>
