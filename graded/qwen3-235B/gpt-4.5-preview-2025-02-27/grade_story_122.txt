<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks depth beyond the stated obsession; reactions to the bridle and storm reveal thematic concepts rather than nuanced psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure with effective beginning/middle/end progression; the confrontation drives the plot but relies on condensed backstory rather than dramatized development within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion; the storm burial site creates a visceral, symbolic backdrop that perfectly aligns with the mirage of safety concept through tactile details like bone textures and electricity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative use of metaphor and paradoxical emotion achieves strong thematic resonance; ending delivers philosophical weight but lacks lingering emotional complexity beyond the central idea.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise executed with vivid imagery, but contains occasionally overwritten phrases ("patiently frantic," "euphoric agitation") that risk feeling more stylized than organic to the character's perspective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive narrative despite the density of symbolic components; the brevity feels intentional but occasionally prioritizes concept over character interiority.</comment>
