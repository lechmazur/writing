<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is emotionally resonant but lacks deeper exploration of "dream thief" backstory; emotional arc is cohesive but underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (whispers, brittle pages) and symbolic settings (crumbling library) masterfully reinforce fragmented identity and melancholic atmosphere.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s through unique combinations (treehouse library, thunder response to sport); some potentially flowery phrases are purposeful rather than excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong cohesion despite multiple elements; brief length feels intentional; emotional resonance lingers through symbolic resolution.</comment>
