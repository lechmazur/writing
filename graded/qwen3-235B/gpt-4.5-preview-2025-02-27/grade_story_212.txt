<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation to escape imposed control is clear, but interiority remains underdeveloped despite symbolic actions; "typically atypical" feels forced rather than organically demonstrated through behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows logical progression through discovery of cards to interdimensional correspondence, but the bottle return feels prematurely resolved within the word limit; emotional payoff lacks sufficient buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ethereal plains create haunting atmosphere with spectral winds and twilight, but missed opportunities for deeper integration (e.g., how post-war toxicity physically manifests in the terrain).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poetic imagery ("ghostly seas") and symbolic use of seeds/cards have impact, but exposition-heavy introspection undercuts "show-don't-tell" principles; emotional resonance remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Conceptual originality in combining apocalypse with magical realism, but "raw solace" clich√© and repetitively ethereal descriptors ("whispered promises") suggest formulaic phrasing tendencies.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Assigned elements drive narrative but feel compartmentalized rather than unified; brief length works for thematic vignette but sacrifices character depth that might deepen emotional engagement.</comment>
