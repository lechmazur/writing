<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's con artist background informs his transformation but remains underlayered; "unusually normal" trait feels underutilized beyond surface implications; redemption arc lacks granular emotional beats to fully justify his pivotal shift.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Limited word count creates tension between setup and resolution; ghostly dialogue feels narratively convenient rather than organically earned; theme of redemption progresses logically but lacks micro-conflicts to deepen structural impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Basic dystopian descriptors establish setting but fail to create visceral immersion; atmospheric elements like the "lull of remorse" and ghostly presence lack sensory cohesion; environmental decay remains visually sketched rather than emotionally palpable.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolism (empty tape dispenser as hollow past) elevates subtext, but some literary devices verge on didactic; emotional resonance diluted by explicit thematic declarations; redemptive arc conceptually satisfying but emotionally under-nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on redemption trope clich√©s; ghost apparition method feels algorithmically chosen rather than organically integrated; atmospheric details occasionally drift toward purple prose; character psychology leans on overgeneralized remorse rather than idiosyncratic guilt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion with slight mechanical adherence to prompts; elements service narrative but lack ingenuity; brevity works against full thematic unpacking; conclusion inspires mild contemplation rather than lasting resonance.</comment>
