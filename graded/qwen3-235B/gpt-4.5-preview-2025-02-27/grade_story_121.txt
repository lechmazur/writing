<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weakly defined 'shiftiness' lacks behavioral texture; motivation to 'unify conflicting hearts' remains abstract rather than embodied through nuanced choices; symbolic interactions (microscope, caravans) compensate for underdeveloped interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Parole hearing framework provides structural spine, but caravan appearances feel contrived rather than inevitable; emotional arc is perceptible but undercut by abrupt transitions between introspection and surreal action within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned drive-in rendered with visceral decay details; atmosphere of impermanence through fading light and evaporating circus elements; however, some descriptions border on ornamental rather than deepening mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphor of mineralized memories offers striking philosophical heft; 'angusthed joy' resonates throughout; ending achieves thematic cohesion yet risks sentimentality through overexplained moral about accepting failure's right.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Unsettlingly precise sensory details (e.g., 'brass gleaming softly') undercut by clunky abstractions ('fleeting nature of second chances'); occasional purple prose ('ephemeral glow illuminating empty roads'); human motivations occasionally flattened into thematic scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Compelling central metaphor sustains narrative despite uneven execution; elements function collectively as symbolic machinery, but individual components (particularly caravans) feel slightly arbitrary rather than organically necessary.</comment>
