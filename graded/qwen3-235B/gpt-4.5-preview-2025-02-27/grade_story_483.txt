<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>While Eli's world-weariness is evident, his internal transformation lacks nuanced progression; motivations are clear but occasionally oversimplified, weakening emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story adheres to a complete arc but relies on abrupt transitions (meditation room epiphany, second garden encounter) that feel compressed rather than organically earned within the tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong sensory immersion in desert landscapes and lava lamp atmosphere, though some settings (garden's symbolic recurrence) risk feeling contrived rather than purposefully layered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by formulaic elements (mysterious drifter, meditation-room epiphany) and occasional overly ornate phrasing that dilutes the gritty, minimalist tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively support the arc but lack surprising creative interplay; the short form feels necessary rather than masterfully exploited to deepen thematic impact.</comment>
