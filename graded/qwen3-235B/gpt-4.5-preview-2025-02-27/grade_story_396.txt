<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lucien's forgetfulness is stated but not deeply integrated; motivations feel externally imposed rather than psychologically rooted. The character's detachment weakens emotional investment, though his role as a passive observer aligns with the "disinterested passion" tone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear structure but feels compressed. The resolution—keeping the fragment hidden—appears abrupt rather than earned. Pacing hesitates between atmospheric description and dialogue-driven conflict, undermining tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Limited sensory immersion; the champagne vault's potential for symbolic richness (effervescence vs. decay) is underexploited. Atmosphere leans on generic Gothic elements (candlelit silence) without distinctiveness tied to the setting's history or function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Themes of cultural preservation are surface-level; the artifact-as-conflict-metaphor lacks nuance. Dialogue between collectors feels didactic rather than organic. The "shared secret" resolution avoids deeper moral inquiry, prioritizing closure over complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but leans on familiar oppositions (tradition/innovation, passion/preservation). Writing style is competent but unremarkable—some overused phrases ("passionately debated") and predictable emotional beats. The vault as a setting suggests originality but remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story feels dutifully constructed around assigned elements rather than organically driven. The ending's thematic gesture ("shared secret") lacks lingering resonance. Conceptual ambition exceeds the emotional depth achieved within the strict word limit.</comment>
