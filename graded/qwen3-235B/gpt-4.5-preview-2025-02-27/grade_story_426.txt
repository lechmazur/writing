<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concept is clear but underexplored. The "angrily peaceful" breathing as a defining trait feels superficial, and reactions to core objects like the teapot lack psychological depth. The grandmother's ghost functions more as plot device than fully-characterized figure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot maintains structural coherence within constraints, but pacing inconsistencies exist. The transition from playlist hacking to supernatural park reactions feels abrupt. Resolution through grandmother's encouragement relies heavily on sentiment over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through lush decay imagery and sensory details like ivy-covered tracks and tea's aroma. The haunted amusement park provides original thematic soil, though the timeframe exists perfunctorily within this rich environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of cultural preservation resonate through poetic metaphors like repair-teapot-as-reconciliation. Emotional impact is undercut by overreliance on telling ("aloof passion") rather than showing nuanced relationships between tradition and modernity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into romanticized decay tropes. Playlist hacking as method shows ingenuity though the concept's mechanical explanation feels undercooked. Sensory details largely avoid generic descriptors but occasionally succumb to ornamental phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements work collectively though not seamlessly. The paradoxical tone and haunting setting achieve literary distinction, but the narrative's emotional core occasionally strains credibility. Leaves readers contemplating tradition-memory interplay but not entirely transformed by it.</comment>
