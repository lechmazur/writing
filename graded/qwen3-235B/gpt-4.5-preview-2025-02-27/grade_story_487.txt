<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation (brother's death) is clear, but "docile" and "disturbingly calm" traits remain underdeveloped, showing only surface alignment with actions. The "bruiser" aspect lacks tangible influence on plot progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Linear plot structure effective despite constraints. "Twist" action and baton's revelation drive momentum cohesively. Minor pacing issues with sudden spectral emergence, but beginning/end connection satisfying.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (humid air, slithering vines) create immersive atmosphere. Greenhouse-labyrinth and man-eating plants conceptually compelling but loosely tied to language barrier theme. Drum solos as rhythm motif works atmospherically.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric use of baton as false redemption device. Sacrifice theme resonates emotionally through "showing" via actions rather than exposition. Minor "tell" instances (e.g., "heart ached with sorrow") undercut subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps but contains occasional purple prose ("man-eating plants whose vibrant petals concealed deadly intent"). Subverts baton trope effectively, though language barriers feel clich√©d as standalone element.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements mostly cohesive but unevenly integrated. The greenhouse setting and baton's twist stand out as organic choices, while language barriers and treasure map method feel partially forced within narrative structure.</comment>
