<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation ties grief to railway mapping, but psychological depth lacks subtlety; emotions often stated rather than shown through layered action. Voice feels generic rather than specific to a weathered woodsman.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing compresses emotional arc too abruptly; short-circuit memory trigger feels contrived. Concept influences plot directionally but sacrifices logic (how echo measurement reveals railway?). Resolution feels narratively convenient rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Radio wave garden's sensory details visually evoke atmosphere but remain decorative rather than thematically integrated. Setting's "artfully messy" quality underdevelops its symbolic potential for character psychology and narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Emotional core resonates through metaphor of mapping as grief process, but relies on clich√©d hospital memory trope. Writing style fluctuates between evocative imagery and overly earnest declarations; ending resolution feels predictable rather than revelatory.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Originality in grief-as-geography concept weakened by tropes: tragic father, symbolic heirloom, static-as-mystical-force. Some passages exhibit AI-like patterned phrasing (e.g., "echoes of history") while emotional subtext lacks nuanced ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story struggles with element overload; several components feel artificially inserted rather than organically connected. Brief length exacerbates disjointedness between conceptual elements (radio garden, echo measurement) and emotional throughline.</comment>
