<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but slightly underdeveloped; Eleanor's transformation feels condensed, with some emotional complexity missing beneath her "rational rebellion" surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but pacing feels hurried in critical moments (grandmother's mural significance, crowd reaction progression); the tight word limit undermines nuanced cause-effect relationships.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details anchor the atmosphere, though the "chalk cliff" and "cheerful gloom" occasionally rely on stock imagery rather than singular specificity that would elevate worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (faded mural, amber brooch) and thematic resonance about tradition vs. change; emotional impact diluted slightly by over-reliance on direct exposition ("imperfect love") rather than subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI writing markers but contains occasionally generic descriptors ("cheerful gloom") and transitions; character interiority shows depth but occasionally veers toward schematic logic rather than organic human contradiction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements form strong structural spine yet occasionally feel checklist-completed rather than organically intertwined; the ending achieves thematic resolution while leaving lingering questions about the colony's future.</comment>
