<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth; Eldrin's ghostly existence remains underexplored despite pivotal breakthroughs with the straw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but relies on coincidental elements (plastic straw discovery); pacing remains tight but pivotal moments feel slightly rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory elements create an immersive, surreal atmosphere; icy-thermal contrasts and spectral details enhance the ethereal tone and Eldrin's isolation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (weaving through fate) and imagery, but emotional impact is diluted by overly poetic descriptions that occasionally distract from narrative depth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original concept strained by repetitive phrasing ("solomnly silly") and occasional disconnect between high-flown language and Eldrin's ethereal nature; avoids major tropes but lacks narrative confidence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Competent integration of assigned elements with noticeable friction; the frozen orchard works well, while "last wish" framing feels tacked on rather than foundational.</comment>
