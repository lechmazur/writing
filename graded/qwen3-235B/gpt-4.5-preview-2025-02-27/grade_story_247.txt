<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character depth implied through contemplative actions, but motivation remains abstract. The poet's voice lacks distinctiveness despite introspective elements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically toward thematic epiphany, but the brevity forces rushed transitions. Some cause-effect connections (e.g., compact's role) lack grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid bonsai imagery and tactile details (candle wax, smudged ink), though power outages feel underutilized in mood-building.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance (sacred flows, bonsai as life mirrors) elevates storytelling. Ending achieves thematic cohesion but struggles with emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dreamlike tone avoids clich√©s in setting/objects but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction. Confessional device feels human, while bonsai symbolism risks romanticization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements combine effectively with minor awkwardness (power outages, compact's origin). The contemplative theme overshadows plot urgency, but the bonsai-as-life metaphor lingers.</comment>
