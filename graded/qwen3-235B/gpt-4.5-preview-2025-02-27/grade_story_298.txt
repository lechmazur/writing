<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lin's chameleon nature drives his immersive method of solving mysteries and performing but remains underexplored beyond surface-level descriptions of his "rational impulse" and emotional honesty. His transformation into the princess lacks psychological depth, and the connection between his impulsivity and method feels stated rather than demonstrated through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc from discovery of the doll's dress to performance-driven resolution, but the tight word limit forces rushed transitions between the princess's backstory and Lin's introspection. Cause-effect logic is coherent, but the mystery-solving process feels abbreviated, leaving emotional stakes underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The post-oil palace's decay juxtaposed with nature's reclamation creates haunting atmosphere, enriched by sensory details (whispering silk, fractured sunlight). Sunlight through debris symbolizes hope but could be more tightly woven into Lin's internal arc. The "anxious serenity" tone is evocative but sparingly dramatized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of theater as resurrection resonates emotionally, but explicit declarations (e.g., "emotional honesty could restore humanity's lost heart") undercut subtler themes. The ending resolves Lin's immediate journey but leans on sentimentalized closure rather than earned revelation. The central conflict between truth and illusion is potent yet partially obscured by poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ideas like "theater from cold cases" feel fresh but occasionally succumb to archaic phrasing ("centuries of pent-up sorrow") and emotional shorthand. The post-apocalyptic setting avoids dystopian clich√©s, yet the doll's dress reveal follows predictable tragic-child tropes. Lin's methodical/impulsive duality lacks complex human nuance, veering into symbolic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements competently but not flawlessly: the oil-depletion timeframe feels underutilized, while the princess's ghostly narrative drives momentum. The brevity allows atmospheric potency but restricts character depth. Lingering thematic questions about art's redemptive power emerge, though the resolution leans on lyrical affirmation over narrative specificity.</comment>
