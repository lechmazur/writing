<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but is superficial; the physician's obsession lacks multidimensionality, and interactions with the cutlass feel archetypal rather than revealing deep motivations. The "bleary-eyed" detail isn't tied to substantive character development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a predictable adventure arc with abrupt transitions; the coffee-ground divination and sudden stranger arrival lack narrative buildup, making the action feel contrived despite clear beginning/middle/end architecture.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like lanterns and jungle are vivid but inconsistently applied; the digital nomad camp clashes tonally with temple mysticism, diluting the "horizon’s edge" timeframe rather than enhancing it.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some haunting imagery ("whispered secrets," "forbidden knowledge") elevates the theme, but emotional resonance remains surface-level; the ending feels cryptic without satisfying thematic payoff or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Riddled with clichés (mysterious stranger, ominous warnings) and purple prose ("deep shadows that whispered, 'Beware'"); coffee-ground divination feels algorithmically inserted rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story clings together but fails to transcend its assigned elements; pacing and tone shifts suggest a template-driven approach rather than cohesive authorial vision; leaves no lingering resonance beyond basic plot completion.</comment>
