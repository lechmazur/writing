<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loyalty to mentor is present but underexplored; motivation for meditation is clear yet shallowly connected to being a "scout"; emotional transformation shown through actions but lacks distinct inner voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure follows a basic arc (storm chaos → meditation → calm), but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect between mentor’s teachings and resolution is abstract; coherence maintained but lacks narrative innovation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with vivid storm imagery, candle/moth symbolism, and tactile details; "sanctified dread" tone is evocative but inconsistently sustained; setting’s scientific purpose underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (moths, storms, journal engraving); theme of embracing turmoil is universal yet resonant; ending feels earned, though emotional depth could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids outright clichés but contains formulaic phrases ("flickering shadows of fluttering moths"); subversive mentor concept is original, but some symbolic elements (e.g., moths) verge on overused; prose occasionally ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Most elements fit cohesively, though "moth observation tower" and "sanctified dread" feel loosely connected; brevity is effective but limits thematic depth; leaves lingering thought on inner turmoil but lacks striking originality.</comment>
