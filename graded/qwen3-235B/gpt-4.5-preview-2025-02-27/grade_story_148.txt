<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but the transformation feels rushed; internal conflict is hinted but lacks sufficient depth for a fully convincing arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is maintained with clear cause-and-effect, but the compressed pacing occasionally undermines emotional weight, particularly in the monastery-to-village transition.</comment>
