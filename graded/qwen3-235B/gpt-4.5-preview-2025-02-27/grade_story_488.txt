<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Minimal emotional complexity; transformation feels declarative rather than earned through action. Internal conflict hinted at but insufficiently dramatized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear structure with symbolic bookends, but pivotal moments (device awakening, existential revelation) feel compressed, relying on lyrical abstraction over narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Evocative surreal details (backward waves, shimmering echoes) but uneven integration of "corroded rapture"—more aesthetic than thematic driver. Sensory immersion lacks tactile specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like merging timelines and self-reflection resonate. Ending transcends cliché through layered symbolism, though some phrasing ("corroded rapture") risks pretension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid original elements (quantum beach) undercut by generic descriptors ("shimmering echoes") and underdeveloped traditions. Emotional resonance peaks in final revelatory scene.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but constrained by brevity; cohesion emerges through poetic imagery over narrative density. Themes linger, though execution imperfectly balances ambition with focus.</comment>
