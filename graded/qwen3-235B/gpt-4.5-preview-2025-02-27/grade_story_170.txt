<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character traits like "free-spirited" lack depth beyond labels; motivation to overcome shame is clear but under-explored beyond surface-level introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable redemption arc; pacing feels inconsistent, with underdeveloped transitions between coral restoration and embroidery as mirrored healing processes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ethereal imagery (ocean, twilight) effectively sets mood, but the coral station feels generic rather than deeply interwoven with character growth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Symbolism (stitching/coral rebirth) is meaningful but familiar; ending resolves conflict too neatly, diluting emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Relies on "nature heals trauma" trope without subversion; writing avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic distinctness or surprising emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Competent execution but derivative themes limit originality; cohesive use of elements feels functional rather than inspired.</comment>
