<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characterization leans heavily on symbolic traits (mechanical arm, sock) rather than nuanced psychology; motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from confrontation to revelation, but the pivotal confession feels psychologically abrupt; cause-effect is logical if improbable within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with tactile descriptions (rusted metal, scraping gears) and moody visuals (moonlight, crumbling stonework), though sensory depth beyond sight/sound is minimal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of equilibrium and reinvention are poetically rendered through metaphor (sock, lighthouse) and symbolic actions, but the reflective ending lacks visceral emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality diluted by clich√©s (abandoned lighthouse, redemptive confession); poetic language occasionally lapses into ornamentation without subverting tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story coheres thematically but strained by overpacked symbolism; brevity sacrifices nuanced character psychology for conceptual abstraction.</comment>
