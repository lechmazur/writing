<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's naivete as a gambler influences key decisions, but his internal conflict remains underexplored despite candle-mold symbolism anchoring his motivations. The first-person narrative voice lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed in its philosophical pivots; cause/effect between professors' disappearance and Elias's final bargain lacks emotional buildup. Pacing stumbles slightly under word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eerie maritime atmosphere created through sensory details (flicker of candles, storm intensity) is immersive, though the tidal power station's scientific function remains underutilized as symbolic counterpoint to mystical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance via candlelight imagery and existential themes; subtext about humanity's precarious relationship with nature emerges clearly. Ending avoids sentimentality but feels slightly overwritten in its final transcendence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic tropes with its unique maritime setting and philosophical bent, but professors verge on caricatured "mad sage" archetypes. Some flowery phrasing ("pulse of the ocean") detracts from emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements mostly work synergistically, though the tidal power station feels underdeveloped as more than visual backdrop. Strong central metaphor of candle-as-fragile-hope unifies disparate elements effectively within word limits.</comment>
