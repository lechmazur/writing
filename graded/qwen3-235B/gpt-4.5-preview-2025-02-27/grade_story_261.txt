<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's assigned traits shape his actions and motivation, but lacks deeper emotional complexity or development, remaining static throughout.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; cause-and-effect connections between elements are present yet underdeveloped, occasionally straining coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich, evocative sensory details (e.g., "shimmering leaves," "spilled ink") create a vivid atmosphere; however, some abstract elements strain immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (ink as history, restoration as futility) and imagery, but emotional resonance is undercut by repetitive phrasing and lack of narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original concept (quantum garden, entropy restoration) is strong, but overuse of phrases like "spilled ink" and abstract descriptions veers toward poetic excess rather than precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically, but the storyâ€™s brevity limits deeper exploration; the ending feels cyclical but not fully impactful.</comment>
