<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but thinly developed; his fanaticism for puzzles drives the plot but lacks psychological depth beyond serving as a narrative device.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear arc from isolation to resolution, but the compressed progression through packages feels rushed; cause-effect logic holds, but pacing is uneven within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Isolation and introspection are evocatively rendered via weather and the lighthouse's symbolic shift from refuge to temple, but sensory details could be more visceral to deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Achieves emotional resonance through metaphors (string as severed connections, lighthouse as self) and subtextual themes, though the ending risks being overly tidy; shows more than tells but lacks narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Occasionally lapses into familiar tropes (mysterious packages, lighthouse isolation) and uses phrases like "lethargic excitement" that strain nuance; subverts predictability slightly via the self-as-puzzle twist.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a serviceable narrative with thematic unity, but the story leans on archetype-heavy components; the lighthouse-as-soul metaphor and package-driven structure lack groundbreaking execution.</comment>
