<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization relies too heavily on stated traits ("grumpy") with minimal behavioral specificity; motivation to confront trauma is underdeveloped despite thematic statements.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression feels schematic - the concept-driven resolution ("multiplying singular") lacks organic causal momentum or meaningful narrative consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually vivid atmosphere with strong sensory details ("velvet drapes," "sand whispers") effectively creates mystical tone, though setting's functional role remains limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic insights about trauma resonate intellectually but emotional impact is diluted by heavy-handed exposition rather than dramatic embodiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Excessive lyrical abstraction ("grandiose subtlety") borders on pretension; metaphors occasionally overwhelm narrative clarity while failing to fully redeem predictable structural elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sufficient cohesion maintained through symbolic through-lines, but execution lacks the exceptional stylistic originality or narrative urgency required for top-tier literary distinction.</comment>
