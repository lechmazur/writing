<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but transformation feels unearned; agoraphobia introduced abruptly without deeper psychological nuance despite surface-level showing. Third-person narration lacks distinct voice that could have heightened internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot resolves too neatly given complexity; snuffbox revelation serves as narrative shortcut rather than organic climax. Pacing efficient but cause-and-effect bordering on contrivance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sensory details mostly effective (whispering dunes, tactile snuffbox), but temporal element 'between songs' feels underutilized atmospheric anchor. Tone of resignation better integrated than 'eager' counterpart.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors function but lack innovation (sand as destiny trope). The 'rhythm of rain' device creates subtle emotional resonance despite mechanical undercurrents. Theme of inherited burdens articulated but not deeply interrogated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains predictable phrasing ('weight of generations'). Emotional progression mostly shown yet occasionally undercut by generalized descriptors. Language occasionally too polished rather than authentically textured.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly fused. Festival setting and temporal constraint feel secondary rather than essential. While thematically coherent, lingering impact undercut by schematic structure.</comment>
