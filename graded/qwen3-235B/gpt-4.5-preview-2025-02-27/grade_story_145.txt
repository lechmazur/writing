<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with empathy-driven goal but lack nuanced internal conflict or distinct voice to deepen connection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with logical cause/effect, though resolution feels rushed; the echo test drives action effectively but the arc is simplified by word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but relies on familiar decayed-gothic imagery; sensory details (rose fragrance, rusted pipes) enhance mood but lack freshness to distinguish setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathy resonates but is over-explained; symbols (rosebud) and dialogue lack subtext; ending is satisfying but predictable, avoiding risk.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Story leans on fantasy tropes (hidden worlds, secret societies) without subversion; prose is accessible but occasionally ornate; emotional beats are stated rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>All elements are integrated, but thematic depth is superficial; brevity works against complexity, leaving concepts underexplored despite competent execution.</comment>
