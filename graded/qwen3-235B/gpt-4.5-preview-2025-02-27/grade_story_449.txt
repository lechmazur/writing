<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's "awkwardness" creates minimal narrative tension; "individually general" traits remain abstract, failing to shape coherent motivations or decisive actions that drive transformation. Internal conflicts lack nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cryptic ritual drives plot but pacing lags; atmospheric descriptions overload early scenes while symbolic climax feels rushed. Cause-effect between baking and philosophical revelation lacks logical progression within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Nebula-observation deck offers vivid setting; "haunting delight" emerges through crackling storm vial and shifting glyphs. However, bakery ritual feels dissonant from sci-fi environment, weakening sensory cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Illuminating symbols-as-philosophy conceptually resonates, but "showing" relies on vague abstractions ("ripple outward") rather than concrete emotional or physical transformation. Metaphors occasionally verge on cliché.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Over-reliance on poetic phrasing ("whispered secrets of unity") creates artificial profundity. Sudden shifts (storm release, glyph formation) feel formulaic rather than earned. Emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>High-concept elements superficially coexist rather than synergize. Length constraints expose structural weaknesses—bread baking as philosophical anchor lacks narrative urgency, while cosmic themes sacrifice emotional immediacy.</comment>
