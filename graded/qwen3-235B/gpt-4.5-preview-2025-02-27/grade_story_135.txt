<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (documenting dialects) is clear and drives actions, but lacks emotional depth. Internal conflict underexplored despite dedication. Uses assigned attributes logically, but limited reactions to objects beyond functionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a complete arc with logical cause-effect, but pacing uneven: trials with caravans rushed, resolution abrupt. Assigned action/method (deciphering bruises) drives narrative effectively, though framework occasionally feels compressed within word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through specific sensory details (grinding wheels, frost, caravan murmurs). The mechanical caravans and frozen harbor create an immersive, thematic setting. Timeframe element (post-wheel invention) remains underutilized and disconnects from central themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of language-as-connection and mechanical guardians of history. Metaphors enhance theme, but emotional resonance weakened by overly descriptive "telling" rather than showing. Ending feels purposeful but lacks lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tone maintains consistency despite fantastical elements. Avoids major clich√©s with mechanical caravans and linguist-brewer concept. Some purple prose in descriptions ("liquid poetry") and underdeveloped cause-effect during climax. Fresh use of straw/tool metaphor balances occasional overprecision in details.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Overall cohesive with clear thematic through-line. Assigned elements generally serve story logic, though timeframe feels tacked-on. Brief length manages complexity well but lacks space for deeper character exploration. Style purposeful but occasionally overwrought.</comment>
