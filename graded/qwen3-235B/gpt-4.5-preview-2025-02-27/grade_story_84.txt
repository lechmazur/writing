<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lucian's theatricality is consistent but his desperation lacks emotional depth; motivations are clear but underexplored. The Collector serves plot needs without complexity. Character interactions feel transactional rather than revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows clear three-act structure within constraints, but tension resolution feels abrupt. Riddle mechanics work logically but pacing stumbles slightly during the challenge sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Unique "walking city" setting creates immediate intrigue but remains superficially rendered. "Frenzied tranquility" concept present yet underdeveloped; sensory details feel selectively applied rather than atmospheric.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective use of memory-as-treasure metaphor and theme of kindness-as-power. Writing style suits whimsical tone but relies excessively on dramatic adjectives; emotional beats could be more subtly embedded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through distinctive setting-concept pairings but leans on "fallen-star" protagonist trope. Commercial-riddle method feels inventive while maintaining narrative logic. Some phrasing feels slightly calculated rather than organically poetic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Successfully weaves assigned elements into cohesive narrative, though some connections appear mechanical rather than organic. Short length serves premise well but restricts thematic expansion. Leaves pleasant thematic aftertaste about authenticity in performance.</comment>
