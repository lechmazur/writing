<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Haruki's redemption arc is generally coherent, but motivations lack deep psychological nuance; Ayumi feels more symbolic than fully realized; emotional shifts occur without sufficient internal conflict exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Letter-driven plot maintains cause-effect logic and clear arc, but emotional beats in reunion feel rushed; pacing uneven during transition from isolation to reconciliation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (mist, crumbling stone) establish mood, but seasonal symbolism feels underutilized; atmospheric connection to corrosion/redemption theme inconsistently developed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (pottery restoration, castle transformation) effectively convey themes, but emotional resonance weakened by explicit declarations ("corroded rapture") rather than fully embodied character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Relies on familiar tropes (haunted castle, estranged child) without subversion; prose occasionally veers into decorative abstraction without emotional specificity, undermining authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story achieves technical cohesion with all elements present, but several feel mechanically inserted rather than organically developed; thematic resonance undercut by narrative shorthand.</comment>
