<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is consistent but thinly sketched, relying on archetypal traits ("somber troubadour") without deep psychological nuance. Motivation is clear but lacks complex internal conflict or evolution beyond initial premises.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has discernible arc within constraints, but pivotal action ("torpedo through layers of silence") feels metaphorically forced. Pacing is uneven—resolution feels rushed compared to slow buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details (rust, ivy, cracked concrete) that reinforce emotional and thematic resonance. Atmospheric coherence is strong despite minimal exposition.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolic imagery and resonant metaphors, but emotional depth leans on tell-don’t-show phrasing ("felt the weight of sorrow lift"). Ending achieves thematic closure without over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Some tropes ("generational curse healing") feel familiar, but the embroidery method adds originality. Prose occasionally bogs down in adverbial over-engineering ("steadily unpredictable joy") without fully slipping into cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements but occasionally prioritizes atmospheric beauty over narrative urgency. Leaves a contemplative aftertaste rather than profound resonance.</comment>
