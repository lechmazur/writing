<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation for transformation is clear but could deepen the psychological nuance behind Elias's shift. The apathetic summoner's voice isn't fully distinct in narration despite vivid interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear arc from apathy to purpose, but pacing feels slightly rushed in mid-sections. Logical cause/effect links (dreams → river wisdom → coral restoration) remain strong within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (crunch of coffee beans, fading reefs) immerse readers effectively, though the shared dream studio's full potential as a liminal space remains underexplored.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant theme of small-actions-as-resilience blends with lyrical metaphors (coffee grinder as patience engine). While emotionally affecting, some "showing" through physicalized interiority could enhance impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids fantasy clichés through inventive pairings (summoning via coffee grinding). No formulaic transitions, though occasional abstractions ("gentle sharpness") border on poetic vagueness rather than precise emotional calibration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually, though frames/before-god's-death elements don't fully permeate the story's architecture. The theme of patience-as-power feels organically developed rather than imposed.</comment>
