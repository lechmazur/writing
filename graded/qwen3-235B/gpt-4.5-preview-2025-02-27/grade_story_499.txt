<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but development is superficial; internal conflict is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc but pacing issues in middle; transitions between underground and surface lack sufficient tension escalation for emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting has vivid imagery (fungi/orchard) but disconnected sensory layers; orchestra setting feels tacked-on rather than symbiotically linked to atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (orchestra as internal struggle) but relies on explicit declarations of emotion; theme of truth resonates without transcendent execution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains tropish undertones (redemptive hero reveal); prose balances ornate vs. functional, though some descriptions verge on formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive but strained by densely packed elements; concept serves narrative in broad strokes but lacks refinement in intersections between symbolism and plot mechanics.</comment>
