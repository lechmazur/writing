<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters are functional but not deeply realized; the dry-witted sentinel's humor feels surface-level, and while motivations are clear, emotional complexity is underdeveloped. The assigned attribute shapes personality superficially but lacks psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but relies on familiar ghost-story tropes; beginning/end connection is effective, but pacing within the limited word count occasionally stalls. The method of confiscation drives action but lacks a distinctive narrative twist.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with evocative sensory details (salt air, crumbling parchment) but occasionally veers into overwrought descriptors. The haunted setting ties neatly to the concept of eroding promises, though some connections (e.g., dancing photograph) feel contrived.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional resonance through symbolic elements (frayed rope, journal), and themes of memory/duty emerge clearly. The ending satisfies thematically but lacks narrative surprise. Subtext about human fragility is effective but not groundbreaking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids egregious tropes through specific imagery but occasionally leans on familiar ghost-story conventions. Witty narration adds individuality, yet phrases like "reckless precision" feel overly contrived. Emotional nuance relies more on subtext than explicit telling, with mixed success.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive, though the dance motif and "reckless precision" feel loosely tied to the broader narrative. Style favors lyrical prose over clarity at times, but the storyâ€™s thematic ambition exceeds its execution within the strict word limit.</comment>
