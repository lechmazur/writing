<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clara's motivation (connection in a digital age) is clear, but her characterization remains static and surface-level. Her "eager lookout" role isn't deeply tied to her personality or development, and the "ruthless kindness" attribute feels imposed rather than organically expressed through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is formulaic but functional. The connection between the beginning (arriving at villa) and end (messenger role) exists, but the poltergeist activity escalation feels rushed. Cause-effect logic is simplistic, with key transitions (e.g., sewing box discovery to library climax) lacking nuance within the word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The setting juxtaposes ancient and modern concepts effectively yet superficially. Sensory details (sunlight, chill, dust) create mild immersion, but the "digital detox retreat" reimagining isn't fully leveraged. Atmosphere supports the theme of lost connections but lacks specificity to maximize emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads/mosaic as connection) and symbolism are clear but over-explained. The ending resolves the central conflict (seeking proof) and leaves thematic resonance about organic bonds, but heavy-handed messaging ("we are not alone in our isolation") undermines subtlety. Tension is minimal.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar supernatural tropes (poltergeists, sudden chill, hidden alcove) without subversion. Phrases like "fleeting glimpses" and "ruthless kindness" border on flowery abstraction. Emotional nuance is overshadowed by explicit statements of theme.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements fit technically but lack cohesion. The "technically organic" concept is underdeveloped, while the sewing box and digital detox setting create partial synergy. The story suggests depth but often prioritizes symbolic parallels over character-driven momentum, leaving ideas more sketched than realized.</comment>
