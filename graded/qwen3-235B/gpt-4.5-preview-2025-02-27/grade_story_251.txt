<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; internal conflict is abstract rather than demonstrated through specific, humanizing details. Motivation feels derived from assigned elements rather than organic psychological development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Plot relies on conceptual symbolism over narrative causality; abrupt shifts between introspection and external action undermine coherence. The central action of "defragmenting" lacks concrete stakes or consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is thin—lunar setting functions more as arbitrary backdrop than an integrated environment shaping character or plot. Sensory details are sparse and generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thematic ambition is undercut by sentimentalism and over-reliance on abstract metaphors ("cosmic scoreboard"). Subtext exists but remains underexplored; ending feels self-congratulatory rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("sterile glow of artificial lights," "fragile harmony") and trope-laden concepts ("prophet," "cosmic puzzle") suggest formulaic thinking. Emotion is stated, not embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements coexist superficially rather than synergizing—e.g., marbles and lunar colony lack narrative necessity. Conceptual density overpowers emotional immediacy; reads as a philosophical exercise rather than a lived story.</comment>
