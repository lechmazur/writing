<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Promising internal conflict and symbolic gestures but lacks depth in complex motivations. Emotional progression feels more thematic than psychologically nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strong circular structure but pacing compresses key transformations. Some transitions (vision sequences, environmental shifts) strain logic within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric cohesion—shipwrecks, submerged glass, and tidal metaphors create haunting beauty. Sensory details particularly strong in aquatic sections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative imagery and layered themes resonate, but emotional impact diluted by abstract resolutions. Metaphors occasionally overshadow character-driven moments.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains familiar redemption arcs. Occasional purple prose ("shimmering softly beneath ocean's surface") balanced by precise tactile descriptions in key scenes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate aesthetically but not always narratively essential. Strong central metaphor compensates for some structural compression issues inherent in the form.</comment>
