<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's shakiness and motivation are clear, but motivations lack depth; his interactions with the amber reveal trapped psychology, yet character voice remains generic and underdeveloped through dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Structure follows a redemption arc but feels hastily resolved; cause-effect logic between improbable rumors and finalization is underexplored, with pacing unevenness in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Setting's decayed beauty and sensory details (e.g., amber light, crumbling stone) enhance mood, though the timeframe's "echoing hour" feels underutilized in reinforcing the theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (amber/spider, murals) effectively conveys theme of trapped longing, but emotional resonance dips into sentimentality; ending suggests growth but lacks narrative complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tropes (haunted mercenary, symbolic object) undermine originality; some phrases ("careful recklessness," "painting over ruins") verge on clich√©, though the cathedral's artistic decay offers modest novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively but formulaically; the brevity highlights forced connections (e.g., "finalizing" vs. starting anew); lingering thematic impact is modest and predictable.</comment>
