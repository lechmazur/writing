<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters act logically but lack sufficient internal depth; motivation to rewrite laws feels somewhat abstract, though impersonation theme shows alignment with identity questions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot maintains forward momentum through key beats, but pivotal moments (e.g., convincing lawmakers) feel underdeveloped, reducing tension and dramatic payoff within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere uses evocative sensory details effectively, though connections between vapor collection, baking, and dream mechanics remain underexplored, leaving potential thematic synergies untapped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Metaphors like "calcified laws" and "quiet pulse" create memorable thematic resonance; emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract descriptors rather than embodied action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Concept has potential but leans on philosophical abstraction tropes; some phrases ("peculiar faith," "occasionally frequent") verge on clich√©d mysticism without fully transcending formulaic structures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but often feel purpose-built rather than organically integrated; the brief form highlights structural efficiency more than lasting resonance or revelatory insight.</comment>
