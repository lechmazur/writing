<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character consistently embodies "sensibly eccentric" traits through methodical detachment and apathetic eagerness; motivations tied to soil study and radio obedience are logically sustained, but lacks psychological depth beyond assigned traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies on unexplained magical logic in soil responding to whip. Pacing awkwardly condenses transformation arc; resolution feels abrupt despite harvesting timeframe constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking tactile details ("worn leather cavern," "thick fertile soil") create immersive atmosphere. Giant's shoe setting cleverly reinforces isolation theme, but connection between scale and soil study remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (whip as bridge between control/harmony) and radio's "earth's soul" revelation offer thematic depth. Passive narration limits emotional engagement, though precise soil pattern descriptions showcase observational craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through unexpected combinations (radio as mystical device, apathetic mystic). Sensory details specific rather than ornate. Avoids overt "telling" while maintaining character-appropriate emotional distance. No detectable AI formulaic patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere around soil interpretation theme but giant shoe and radio feel arbitrarily chosen. Brief length highlights poetic potential but sacrifices narrative momentum. Memorable tone compensates for structural thinness.</comment>
