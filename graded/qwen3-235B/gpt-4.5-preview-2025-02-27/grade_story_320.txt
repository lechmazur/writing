<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (cosmic imbalance) is clear but underdeveloped; personality traits (shyness, disinterest) contrast effectively but lack nuanced human complexity in key moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot progression driven by social media posts feels contrived within underwater setting; parallel timelines and cosmic resolution are conceptually ambitious but structurally rushed in short form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic atmosphere through seaweed-draped stalls, dim glow, and dissolving tears; however, sensory depth beyond visuals remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of intergenerational regret resonate emotionally; "confusingly clear" imagery offers intriguing symbolism but resolution veers toward sentimentalism rather than earned epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Underwater market/social media fusion feels algorithmically imposed; metaphors for fractured timelines are conceptually original but execution contains purple prose and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overloaded with assigned elements that awkwardly coexist; brevity undermines thematic payoff; cohesive yet derivative in its mythic redemption arc structure.</comment>
