<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Poorly developed characters; motivations and internal conflicts are underexplored, relying on vague melancholy instead of concrete traits. The lack of dialogue or distinct behaviors leaves both Akira and Emi feeling like symbolic constructs rather than living characters.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot relies on poetic gestures and decoding celestial patterns, which feel contrived rather than organic. The story loops from one image to another without clear stakes or progression. Pacing is uneven, with pivotal moments glossed over (e.g., Emi's "discovery" of the language is unearned).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting lacks specificity—the castle is more atmosphere than lived-in space. Meteor showers and faded flowers evoke mood but lack tactile detail (e.g., texture of bark, scent of herbs). Atmosphere leans on generic "mysterious" tones rather than immersive worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on abstract symbols (flowers = loss, stars = fate) without deep emotional grounding. The silent dialogue concept is poetic but feels overfamiliar, evoking "show don't tell" without transcendent execution. Ending is tidy but emotionally hollow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original in combining celestial and botanical motifs, but execution borders on cliché (lost love, cryptic wisdom). Avoids overt purple prose but sometimes replaces it with vague descriptors ("dramatically subtle," "quiet intimacy"). Subtext is present but leans on well-worn melancholy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements are present but unevenly integrated. The castle and "intertwined fates" feel like checkmarks rather than essential components. The story’s core—the silent connection—is affecting, but its potential is constrained by overly abstract execution and underdeveloped character dynamics.</comment>
