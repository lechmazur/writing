<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation and backstory through the photograph, but transformation feels rushed. Internal conflict shown but underdeveloped. Voice is consistent but lacks emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Well-structured within word limit, but the journal discovery strains credibility. Pacing uneven toward climax; transitions slightly forced despite coherent arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Bioluminescent bacteria create vivid atmosphere with strong symbolism, but underutilized technology details. Sensory integration effective but worldbuilding surface-level beneath aesthetic appeal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Candle/stars as symbols work well, but ending teeters on clich√©. Emotive language occasionally overwrought, undercutting raw authenticity the theme demands. Theme consistent but subtlety undermined by direct statements.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some phrases ("delicate balance," "celestial tapestry") verge on generic. Tropes refreshed through setting details (bacteria-city, journal discovery) but emotional arc follows predictable growth template without deeper deconstruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively integrated with some inspired combinations (bacteria vs. stars), though certain components (sincere performances) feel obligatory rather than organic. Style mostly enhances but occasionally distracts through over-description.</comment>
