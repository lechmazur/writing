<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's reluctant caretaker role and analytically playful nature are inconsistently developed; emotional complexity of "gleeful sorrow" feels underexplored, and motivations shift lacks sufficient nuance</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc compressed by word limit; abrupt transitions between orchard and farmhouses, rushed resolution; cause-effect logic is sometimes thin despite clear conceptual through-line</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid contrast between futuristic hub and cursed orchard creates strong initial atmosphere; phosphorescent fungi and decayed farmhouses effective but some sensory details remain generic rather than immersive</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Visions and symbolic resurrection of dragon provide emotional resonance; subtext about silenced voices works, but "showing" vs "telling" balance uneven in character transformation</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s through unique mythic framework, but contains traces of purple prose and logical convenience (dragon tooth conveniently placed); some emotional beats feel algorithmically patterned rather than organic</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements fit together technically but strain under word limit; futuristic hub's purpose remains unclear; themes are coherent but not deeply layered; resolution feels somewhat formulaic despite clever central metaphor</comment>
