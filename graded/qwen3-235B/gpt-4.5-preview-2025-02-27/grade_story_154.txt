<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's assigned attribute ("strongly weak") is inconsistently explored; motivation (tracking social changes through urban legends) feels underdeveloped beneath plot mechanics. Emotional shifts during levitation ritual lack visceral human nuance despite surface coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows ritual ascent logic but relies on convenient cause-effect (ink pot suddenly unlocking powers); pacing strains credibility in compressed arc. Levitation climax feels abrupt despite atmospheric groundwork.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting combines vivid Celtic motifs (knotwork, bonfires) with sensory textures, though "jubilant despair" atmosphere occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction rather than tangible mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Successfully weaves theme of courage-as-woven-fragility through recurring symbols; ending resonates with philosophical subtext about embracing vulnerability. Over-reliance on abstract concepts slightly dampens emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original use of "ink from heroes' tears" avoids full trope repetition, but elder figure and ritual framework feel derivative. Language stays purposeful despite occasionally florid descriptors ("jubilant despair").</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but unevenly - ink pot and levitation drive narrative, while "between games" timeframe and courier profession remain underexploited. Thematic resonance outweighs structural limitations.</comment>
