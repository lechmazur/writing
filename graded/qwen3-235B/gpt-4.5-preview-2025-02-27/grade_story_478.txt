<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mirabel’s motivation to recover memories drives her actions, but her role as a midwife doesn’t deeply shape her personality or choices. Her agency is clear, but emotional depth remains thin despite enigmatic allure.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of memory recovery, but the tight word limit strains cause-effect logic (e.g., sudden empowerment via herbs). Pacing feels rushed in key transitions, weakening emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive sensory details (smoke, glowing fruit, maelstrom) create a haunting atmosphere. The orchard island’s surreal setting powerfully amplifies themes of loss and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s metaphor of fragmented diaries mirroring fractured identity is effective, but emotional resonance stays surface-level. Writing is lush but occasionally overwrought, diluting subtler thematic layers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Relies on mystical isolation tropes without subversion. Sensory details feel specific but occasionally veer into ornate abstraction. Some phrases (“vivid and complete memories”) default to clichéd resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements like herbs, diaries, and the maelstrom cohere into a thematically consistent whole, but the story’s brevity limits exploration of deeper philosophical questions, leaving ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
