<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's rebellious nature shapes actions but lacks psychological depth; motivations to restore remembrance feel underexplored; connection between obituary-writing and broader rebellion is implied but not emotionally excavated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Premise drives plot forward but pacing feels strained by word count; sudden shifts in stakes (e.g., regime confrontation) lack buildup; conceptual symmetry between beginning/end obituaries exists but structural cohesion remains thin.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bookshelf/atmosphere richly textured but over-reliant on shadow/light contrasts; revolutionary rumors create tension but remain contextual backdrop rather than immersive world-building; some missed opportunities for sensory specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Offers thought-provoking metaphors about narrative power but leans on trope-laden heroism in conclusion; imagery (shifting mask, humming organ) creates emotional resonance but subtext about authorship vs. fate feels superficially developed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in core conceits (obituaries for living, morphing mask) but stumbles with genre defaults (heroic sacrifice, storming strongholds); language mostly restrained but occasionally curdles into ornate abstraction ("lucid frenzy").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially coexist rather than organically integrate; story's brevity feels restrictive rather than deliberate; central theme emerges faintly but lacks the piercing clarity demanded by its ambitious concepts.</comment>
