<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve art is present but underdeveloped; "reserved" trait lacks demonstration through actions or interactions; no internal conflict or growth visible.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Coherent through atmosphere and repetition but lacks plot progression, conflict, or clear structural peaks; resolution feels arbitrary despite vignette-style construction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory imagery establishes mood, but the laboratory setting's sound focus isn't meaningfully tied to textile mending; some disconnected elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (ripple effect, needle as storyteller) but emotional impact is diluted by static narrative; theme lacks complexity despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise (sound lab as preservation space) but relies on overused descriptors ("whispers," "tapestry") and lacks subversive depth; near-poetic tone occasionally veers into ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere atmospherically but lack narrative urgency; feels intentionally brief yet leaves thematic potential unrealized due to limited emotional grounding.</comment>
