<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's traits are vaguely defined; "patiently frantic" lacks concrete behavioral grounding. Motivation is abstract and inconsistently expressed through actions. No distinct voice in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure present but underdeveloped. Action drives the narrative, but cause-effect lacks clarity (e.g., lightning reflection's purpose). Pacing uneven; ending feels abrupt without resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>World-building shallow. Sky burial site and storm atmosphere lack specificity; sensory details generic. Failed to connect setting with thematic elements like the "mirage of safety."</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery without emotional resonance. Metaphors superficial; ending unsatisfying. Central conflict (storm vs. character) lacks thematic payoff or layered meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("frantic," "euphoric agitation") and clich√©d storm descriptions. Overwrought prose ("kaleidoscope of color") overshadows originality. Nuance and subtext absent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements check boxes but lack cohesion. Story feels constrained by assigned components rather than organically integrating them. Lacks lingering impact or innovation.</comment>
