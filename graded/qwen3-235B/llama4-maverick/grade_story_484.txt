<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character traits like "groggy" and "flippant solemnity" lack coherent integration; motivation for social justice is stated rather than demonstrated through concrete actions or conflicts; the "uniquely generic" attribute feels tacked on without shaping behavior; reactions to mirror and darkness remain abstract, missing visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Narrative momentum stalls due to meandering symbolism; the staircase discoloration as a plot device feels arbitrary, weakening cause-effect logic; pacing mismanages tension between protest and introspection, leaving arc resolution vague; core concept of 'initiate' remains metaphorically murky rather than driving concrete plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting relies on haunted mansion clich√©s with overused sensory descriptors (e.g., "crumbling headstones," "thick darkness"); protest atmosphere lacks specific cultural/political texture; tone shifts awkwardly between melodramatic and didactic; mirror-object connections to setting feel forced rather than organically symbolic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery-heavy prose occasionally achieves poetic resonance ("shadows twisting like living things") but often succumbs to redundancy; theme of art-justice synthesis emerges faintly but lacks narrative embodiment; ending opts for vagueness over meaningful resolution; subtext remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Overuses Gothic tropes without subversion; "flippant solemnity" manifests as inconsistent tonal whiplash; repetitive adverbial qualifiers ("overwhelmingly," "unyieldingly") dilute impact; metaphors (darkness as adversity) feel exhausted; emotional beats rely on declarations rather than embodied experience, suggesting algorithmic pattern-recognition over nuanced insight.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion strained by competing elements: protest framing feels detached from Gothic metaphor-play; stylistic flourishes obstruct clarity; brevity seems limiting rather than purposeful; theme of conviction vs. ambiguity remains underexplored, leaving most assigned elements feeling decorative rather than foundational.</comment>
