<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Apathy inconsistently portrayed; character's transformation lacks psychological grounding. Motivation via paradoxical metaphor feels abstract, not dramatized through specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fragmented structure prioritizes imagery over narrative momentum; plot progression feels arbitrary. Cause/effect relationships (e.g., map discovery â†’ transformation) lack logical or emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Ethical light fungi create atmosphere, but setting functions as wallpaper rather than a living environment shaping character/plot. Overreliance on adjectives over tactile details.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy-handed metaphors ("barbed wire arms") dominate; some evocative moments undercut by abstract generalizations. Theme of emotional transformation lacks urgency or conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("hum of insight," "twisted fungi"), generic sensory descriptors, and overwrought symbolism suggest formulaic writing. Tropes (labyrinthine garden, glowing plants) lack subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elements included as checklist items rather than organic components. Abstract ending leaves story feeling unfinished rather than intentionally open-ended.</comment>
