<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's ambivalence and motivation are mostly stated rather than shown through action. Internal conflict lacks tangible manifestation in behavior or decision-making.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is circular but lacks development. The connection between beginning/end exists but feels underserved by minimal narrative progression within constraints.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ideas aren't derivative but execution borders on pretentious. Some originality in cosmic metaphors, but generic descriptors and overly formal tone reduce distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements coexist within the narrative but often feel assembled rather than integrated. Brevity works conceptually but sacrifices narrative cohesion.</comment>
