<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character is a passive vessel with vague motivations; "subtle" trait lacks meaningful demonstration through distinct actions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No narrative arcâ€”static progression with no causal stakes or resolution; "fleeting moment" conceals structural incoherence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies on trope-laden fantasy conventions; flowery abstraction and lack of subtext suggest formulaic AI patterning rather than deliberate craft.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Element integration feels checklist-driven; the story neither justifies its constraints nor demonstrates urgent reason to exist.</comment>
