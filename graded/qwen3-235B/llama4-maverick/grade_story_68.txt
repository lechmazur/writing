<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's moral code is present but thinly rendered; motivations are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth, with actions only loosely tied to deeper personal history or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot has directional movement but suffers from compressed pacing; the inscriptions-as-method drives the narrative unevenly, with underdeveloped cause-effect transitions between key moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting mashes eras intriguingly but lacks visceral sensory richness; the tea-steeping moment introduces atmosphere but insufficiently anchors the story's emotional pivot points.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Storytelling employs evocative symbols (bottle caps as relics, inscriptions as fragmented memory) with moderate effectiveness; thematic cohesion around remembrance exists but lacks piercing originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("canvas for the hacker's art") and relies on loosely connected metaphors without fully subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but execution feels constrained by its brevity; elements coalesce intellectually but lack visceral resonance or structural precision required for elite-tier publishability.</comment>
