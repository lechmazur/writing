<question>1</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Character lacks concrete selflessness; motivation implied rather than demonstrated through actionable choices; inconsistent alignment between "savage grace" actions and undefined mission purpose; no dialogue or distinct voice to establish individuality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks clear progression; abstract imagery replaces cause-effect; artificial arc forced by ending resolution; disjointed pacing with no discernible middle; conceptual elements mentioned rather than dynamically deployed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Visually sparse setting; "recycled spaceship" underutilized; sensory details limited to auditory elements; mismatched wind chimes and vinyl record create tonal whiplash; atmosphere relies heavily on vague cosmic awe rather than grounded specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Potent imagery occasionally surfaces but diluted by excessive abstraction; "savage grace" concept inconsistently applied; emotional impact is intellectualized rather than visceral; symbolic throughlines emerge too late to anchor the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Prose exhibits AI-patterns: repetitive adverbs (inexplicably, seemingly), formulaic juxtapositions (haunting/refrain, savage/beauty), and overused cosmic metaphors; emotional subtext exists only at surface level; "centuries of longing" trope signals algorithmic reliance on grand temporal scales.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist items rather than organic narrative components; theme remains abstract despite element density; excessive conceptual scaffolding collapses under word count limitations; stylistic choices undermine coherence rather than enhance.</comment>
