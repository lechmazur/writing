<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Weak internal consistency; motivation is abstract and underdeveloped, with minimal action-driven characterization. "Humorless comedic actor" trait underutilized beyond passive contemplation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Meandering structure prioritizes poetic digressions over narrative momentum; resolution feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically earned through plotted action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clichéd desolation imagery; sensory details are present but lack precision to distinguish setting beyond generic "lonely playground" tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphorical potential undermined by overexplicit thematic declarations; emotional resonance compromised by abstract tell-don’t-show approach.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Occasional fresh imagery (e.g., "dying breath") amidst overly ornate diction and formulaic juxtapositions of cosmic metaphor with personal introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Ambitious thematic synthesis diluted by uneven execution; elements function individually but lack cohesive interplay to justify existence as a unified artistic statement.</comment>
