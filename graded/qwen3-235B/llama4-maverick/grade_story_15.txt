<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth and inner conflict. Motivation is conceptually sound but not deeply personal; actions are repetitive rather than revealing of layered psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Linear progression lacks narrative tension. The postcards' role in driving the plot is ambiguous, reducing their functional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (smell of decay, golden forge light) immerse readers, but the "centuries of fog" timeframe and "between meals" routine feel underexplored in practical narrative function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbolism (forge as defiance) and lyrical imagery are present, but emotional impact diluted by persistent exposition over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clich√©s (rebuilding ruins, anonymous letters) remain uninterrogated. Prose veers toward overwrought ornamentation without purposeful subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Passably cohesive but forgettable. Elements like "serious playfulness" exist abstractly without technical execution to support their thematic weight.</comment>
