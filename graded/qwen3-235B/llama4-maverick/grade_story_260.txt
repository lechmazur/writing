<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's motivations (obsession, reconciliation) are vaguely stated but not deeply internalized; actions lack psychological complexity or evolution, remaining static. Assigned attribute "indefinitely absolute" is referenced but doesn't shape coherent behavior patterns.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative has basic arc (night-to-dawn progression) but lacks dramatic tension or consequential decisions. Assigned action "proliferate" is metaphorically handled but doesn't drive plot mechanics. Cause-effect between rewriting diaries and "lost souls" remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic Gothic tropes (yellowed pages, moonlight) without original environmental logic. "Whisper collection point" concept lacks systemic rules or cultural context. Sensory details are uneven—visual flourishes outweigh tactile/auditory elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uses striking metaphors ("brass key ring as connection") but struggles with emotional authenticity—resolution feels artificially imposed rather than earned. "Noble chaos" theme is conceptually stated but shallowly dramatized through vague "patterns in diaries."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Generative fingerprints evident: repetitive phrasing ("lost souls" 5x), overly abstract diction ("noble chaos"), and synthetic rhythm in sentence structures. Metaphors ("moth to flame") feel recycled without fresh context. Emotional progression lacks nuanced causality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Overambitious element integration creates disjointedness—theory-heavy themes overshadow concrete storytelling. Length works against coherence; concepts are introduced without dramatization. "Purpose" declaration in ending feels authorially imposed rather than organically revealed.</comment>
