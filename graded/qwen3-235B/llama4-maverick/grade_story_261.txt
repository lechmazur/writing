<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character's immortality is underexplored, motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through layered emotional or psychological conflict. The "rigidly flexible" trait feels superficially applied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses linearly but lacks narrative tension; the "launch" into action arrives abruptly without escalating stakes. The ink pattern resolution is contrived, and the tight word limit leaves little room for meaningful cause-and-effect progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "particle acceleration" element is underutilized, failing to shape atmosphere or interact meaningfully with the garden’s decay. Sensory details (e.g., the cover’s texture) are sparse and functional, not immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (ink patterns as historical testimony, earbud material mirroring existence) are conceptually striking but lack narrative follow-through. The theme of rediscovering purpose is clear but not deeply nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overly ornate phrases ("weight of centuries," "ephemeral nature of ink") lean into cliché despite the unique fusion of science and decay. Emotional resonance relies on stated bitterness rather than subtext or organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements like the earbud cover and ink patterns add originality, but the story leans on poetic abstraction without grounding in tactile, logical connections. The ending is predictable, lacking lingering ambiguity or resonance.</comment>
