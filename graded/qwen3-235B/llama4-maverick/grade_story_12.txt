<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's aloofness remains superficial despite metaphorical mapping; motivation to "learn the language of the soul" lacks psychological grounding; actions disconnect from traits (aloofness dissolves abruptly without emotional nuance).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot relies on abstract emotional shifts rather than cause-effect; "expand" action appears arbitrarily; circular structure exists but feels contrived; pacing lingers on metaphors at expense of narrative momentum; ending lacks resolution/resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Contrast between sterile mall and cracked tile symbolism works, but futuristic elements remain decorative; "crossroads of destinies" lacks spatial specificity; sensory details prioritize poeticism over immersive coherence; tone shifts inconsistently between sterile and romantic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (waves, tapestries) elevate thematic depth, but emotional impact diluted by overreliance on familiar imagery; subtext about fractured beauty emerges clearly; dialogue absent while "showing" occurs through passive observation; ending gesture toward self-discovery feels insufficiently earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Florid comparisons ("sterile surfaces giving way to vibrant hues") border on purple prose; reliance on overused motifs (mapping as emotional journey, brokenness as beauty); character psychology follows formulaic "aloof-softening" arc; atmospheric contrasts feel derivative; attempts at uniqueness collapse into generic romanticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Burdensome integration of mandated elements creates artificiality; aloofness contradicts central surrender; excessive abstraction dilutes emotional specificity; story-as-poem format fails to generate narrative urgency despite lyrical passages; lacks clear interpretive lens for deeper engagement.</comment>
