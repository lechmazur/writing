<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character voice is present but thinly developed. Motivation to "preserve ancient practices" lacks emotional depth or internal conflict; traits like "fruitlessly patient" are mentioned but not dramatized. No distinguishing psychological complexity or growth emerges beyond surface descriptions of rituals.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a loose meditative arc but lacks causality. The social archive discovery initiates reflection, but there's no substantive complication or resolution. Action ("elongate preparation") exists conceptually rather than dramatically - momentum derives more from thematic repetition than narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Virtual archive setting is inert backdrop rather than immersive worldbuilding. Undertaking workspace described through vague painterly metaphors ("whirling colors") but lacks specific sensory textures. Brass measuring tape and paint mixing lack tactile or atmospheric connection to core themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Imagery of "myth of ordinariness" and ancestral continuity is conceptually provocative. Metaphors about slowing time to honor traditions resonate thematically. Ending ties action to metaphor with satisfying symmetry, though emotional impact remains intellectualized rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>No formulaic elements detected. Writing exhibits distinctive style with original metaphors ("digital legacy" as "cold repository") and nuanced handling of paradoxical tones (jubilant remorse). Sensory details feel purposefully constructed rather than generic, avoiding cloying sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elements shoehorned rather than organically integrated. The brief length highlights fragmentation - disconnected scenes function more as thematic sketches than cohesive narrative. Central conflict between tradition/speed remains abstract without concrete dramatization of opposing forces.</comment>
