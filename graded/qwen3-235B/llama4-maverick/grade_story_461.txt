<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's irate nature lacks nuanced development; transformation feels abrupt. Motivation to heal old wounds is clear but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence but feels compressed; emotional arc from anger to peace lacks gradual buildup. Cause-effect logic holds.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vibrant sensory details (e.g., "scent of old parchment") immerse readers, but the witch's study's connection to the pendant and timeframe could be tighter.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lucid imagery and symbolic resonance (e.g., pendant as generational bridge) elevate impact, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose occasionally veers into overwrought phrasing ("cacophony that harmonized into symphony"), but avoids overt clich√©s. Limited emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but formulaic; childhood bedroom setting and meditation method feel more ornamental than integral. Lacks thematic ambition.</comment>
