<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation (peace with the past) is clear but lacks depth; "shaky" and "carefully reckless" traits surface-level, with underdeveloped psychological nuance. Interactions with objects and setting hint at inner conflict but fail to fully reveal personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular structure but lacks narrative tension. Rumors driving the plot feel abstract, with resolution relying on cryptic dialogue rather than cause-effect. Pacing lags in middle, closure feels abrupt despite constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory details (damp stone, spray paint) immerse effectively. The cathedral’s duality as ruin/art space enhances mood, but timeframe ("echoing hour") while atmospheric, doesn’t integrate tightly with plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Uses symbolic motifs (amber/spider, light/dark) but emotional resonance is muted by vague character psychology. Central theme of closure emerges but remains underexplored. Lyrical prose lacks payoff in depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Relies on gothic clichés (abandoned cathedrals, talismans) and predictable arc (redemptive journey). Some lyrical phrasing veers into purple prose. "Improbable" elements feel undercontextualized, lacking subversion of genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion but integrates elements unevenly. Strongest aspects are setting and symbolism; rumors and timeframe feel extrinsic. Ambitious themes falter due to underdeveloped character interiority and abstract conflict.</comment>
