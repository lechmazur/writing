<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is present but underdeveloped; intelligence and foolishness traits aren't fully demonstrated through actions; fragmented identity theme is hinted but shallowly explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tight structure with clear beginning/middle, but revolutionary arc feels rushed; cause-effect connections between caves, taxi, and rebellion aren't fully earned within word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere has evocative phrases ("soothing resonance") but lacks concrete sensory details; setting's cosmic significance remains underexplored despite rich potential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (figurine) and metaphorical language (discords of rebellion) offer depth, but emotional resonance remains superficial; theme of imperfection feels more stylistic than structural.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>While combining elements creatively, repetitive descriptors ("measured wildness," "intelligently foolish") and metaphor clusters resemble AI-generated patterns; emotional subtext lacks human nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels mechanical; brevity aids momentum but sacrifices character nuance; concept integration is competent rather than revelatory.</comment>
