<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is poetic but underdeveloped; mechanic identity lacks connection to plot actions, motivations feel abstract rather than psychologically grounded, reactions to tools/fragments remain externalized</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot exists as atmospheric loops rather than causal progression; gathering fragments drives structure but lacks narrative stakes or tension; abrupt transitions between static scenes</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Visually lush but ecologically incoherent setting; orchard fed by stars creates intriguing imagery but fails to integrate with character's mechanical function or thematic purpose</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance but diluted emotional impact; metaphors overwhelm narrative thrust; attempts profundity through abstraction but lacks concrete human relatability</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mix of striking originality (orchard mechanics) and formulaic phrasing ("whispers of the unknown"); occasionally veers into ornate abstractions that obscure deeper meaning</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements exist in parallel rather than synergy; ambitious stylistic choices partially compensate for structural looseness; concept-heavy but emotionally diffuse</comment>
