<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Anthropomorphism lacks psychological depth; motivations stated rather than demonstrated through organic decisions. Sentience feels like a superficial trait rather than a deep transformation. Internal conflict between apathy and determination remains abstract without specific behavioral indicators.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragmented progression lacks causal urgency. Descriptive passages overwhelm plot momentum. The drive-in discovery feels disconnected from initial motivation. Ending implies growth but pays insufficient attention to transformation mechanics within limited scope.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative decay imagery creates palpable atmosphere through tactile details ("quivering leaves," "cracked asphalt"). The drive-in serves as effective metaphorical repository for forgotten voices. Some transitions between personal and environmental scales feel uneven despite strong individual set pieces.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition evident in using vegetation to explore knowledge-gathering. Metaphors about "unspoken" knowledge are intriguing but underdeveloped. Ending's "inner fire" symbolism contradicts botanical reality without sufficient thematic justification. Emotional resonance remains surface-level despite potent imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Excessive adjectival decoration ("scalding ambivalence," "desolate streets") risks self-parody. Anthropomorphic logic inconsistent when roots suddenly "outrun" shadows. Some phrases ("driven by hunger to uncover") read as generic templates rather than fresh invention. Tension between botanical reality and emotional life insufficiently explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coherence maintained despite eclectic elements, though connections remain tenuous. Formal experimentation with plant protagonist shows creativity but execution prioritizes style over substance. Lingering questions about knowledge preservation feel more thematic prompt than developed concept. Form and constraint mastery present but unevenly realized.</comment>
