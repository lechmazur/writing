<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character traits are consistent but lack depth; motivation is abstract rather than visceral. The tinkerer's emotional arc remains diffuse despite recurring references to internal states.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure but thin on conflict/resolution dynamics. The task's simplicity vs. difficulty is stated rather than dramatized. Pacing feels rushed in pivotal moments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmospheric details (scent of ozone, molecular machines) create texture but the nano-scale city's unique logic isn't fully exploited. The mask's integration with setting lacks specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors (plague doctor mask as resilience) and thematic concerns about reconciliation resonate, but emotional payoff feels muted. Ending doesn't fully crystallize the central conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing ("liminal time," "hopeful excavations") and formulaic transitions. Sensory details like "solder and ozone" feel generic rather than world-building specific. Subtext could be more organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack symbiotic depth. The nano-city setting and "interconnected wishes" feel underutilized for their narrative potential. Lingering impression is vague rather than piercing.</comment>
