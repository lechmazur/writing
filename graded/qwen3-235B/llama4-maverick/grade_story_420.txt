<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Vague traits, inconsistent action alignment. Character's hopefulness feels superficial; motivations shift without emotional depth. Puzzle ring symbolizes "creative struggles" abstractly rather than revealing concrete character insights.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Fragmented trajectory. Action pivots abruptly from stagnation to inspiration without believable escalation. Fossil-to-bark connection lacks narrative causality. Resolution feels tacked-on despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ostentatious details over substance. Sensory descriptions (e.g., "rough bark," "thick air") are checklist-like rather than immersive. Atmosphere oscillates between graveyard solemnity and mystical awakening without tonal cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Undercooked metaphors. Light-as-boundary concept remains metaphorical debris rather than structural theme. Ending achieves neither catharsis nor ambiguity â€“ simply trails off as if exhausted by its own verbosity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Predictable beats. Relies on "blocked artist finds muse" tropes. Overworked adjectives ("palpable stillness," "unusual energy") inflate simplicity. Sculptor's transformation lacks psychological nuance, reads as mechanical plot device.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Hollow pastiche. Elements superficially cohere but lack narrative symbiosis. Style mimics literary pretension without earning emotional stakes. Ends with declarative bombast that disguises emptiness beneath flowery scaffolding.</comment>
