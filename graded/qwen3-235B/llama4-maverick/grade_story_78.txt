<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Lack of concrete character development; abstract traits like "softly militant" and "late-blooming" are stated but never dramatized. Motivation for cosmic inquiry is inconsistently tied to emotional gravity of loss. Minimal distinct voice in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>No discernible plot structure—repetitive static imagery replaces progression. Beginning/middle/end framework absent; reliance on abstract monologue undermines dramatic tension. Pacing meanders without resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Vague "post-apocalyptic" descriptors (desolate landscape, rooftop farm) lack sensory specificity. Atmosphere leans on clichéd tropes without visceral details; setting functions more as poetic backdrop than integral worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly stylized prose emphasizes cosmic metaphor over narrative impact. Emotional resonance undercut by exposition; ending lacks transformative closure. Themes of loss-as-illumination remain cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on grandiose abstractions ("architecture of cosmic balance") and recycled post-apocalyptic imagery. Stilted sensory details ("warm, golden light") and overwrought phrases ("space between the first tear and final sigh") suggest formulaic cadence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements included as checklist checkboxes rather than organic components. Style prioritizes ornamental language over clarity; brevity feels restrictive, not purposeful. Fails to cohere into a thematically unified whole.</comment>
