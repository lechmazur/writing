<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced action. Core conflicts remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plot has an arc but feels rushed; the connection between water rings and environmental revelation lacks gradual development. Pacing uneven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid, dystopian atmosphere with strong sensory details, but setting occasionally overwhelms narrative without deep integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Imagery and symbolism are effective, but emotional resonance is undercut by overly abstract declarations instead of layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but slips into overwritten flourishes (e.g., "molten sarcasm") and predictable despair-to-hope transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story holds together but lacks thematic sharpness; some elements feel contrived for spectacle rather than organic cohesion.</comment>
