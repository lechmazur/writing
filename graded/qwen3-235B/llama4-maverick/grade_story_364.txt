<question>1</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Attribute is superficially attached to passive observation but lacks psychological depth or clear motivation; actions are vaguely driven by curiosity without coherent personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on vague, fragmented sequences (finding pottery, advising researcher, photographing trades) that lack cause-effect logic; abrupt shifts between revolution and quotidian details undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Temporal anomaly study setting is underexplored and inconsistently tied to revolution; botanical sketches are ornamental, not atmospheric; sensory details are sparse and generalized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (shimmering sketches, revolution as mist) hint at thematic potential but surface-level emotional engagement; ending feels platitudinous rather than resonant; lacks active demonstration of "showing" techniques.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Concepts like "silent revolution" and "mundane miracles" lean on overused abstractions; overly ornate descriptions ("cryptically clear illustrations") occasionally border on purple prose without subversive reimagining.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements function as isolated symbols rather than integrated components; thematic cohesion about reexamination is hinted but shallowly rendered; style over substance compromises brevity's narrative impact.</comment>
