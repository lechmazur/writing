<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prince's motivation is clear and consistent, but his emotional depth remains underdeveloped. The stranger's role lacks individuality, and their connection feels arbitrarily forged without sufficient psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Plot relies on contrived event (snowstorm) for progression. The beginning and end lack narrative payoff, feeling abrupt and truncated. Cause-and-effect relationships are simplistic, with underdeveloped emotional stakes within the limited word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere established through dust and isolation, but sensory details remain superficial. The setting's connection to the prince's exile feels symbolic but underexploited, with temperature contrasts (snow/interior) hinting at more potential atmospheric depth unfulfilled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mortar/pestle as healing, storms as fate) operate at surface level. Some emotional resonance emerges through human connection trope, but explicit emotional declarations undermine showing. Ending's thematic echo of "connection in isolation" lacks complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies heavily on romantic exile trope, snowstorm contrivance, and generic "loneliness" theme. Overly formal descriptors ("eerily familiar," "serene silence") create distance. Emotional beats feel dictated by formula rather than organic introspection, with inconsistent metaphor freshness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than cohere. The prince's identity and mortar's significance remain tools for atmosphere rather than narrative drivers. While brief length allows thematic suggestions, the story lacks transformative insight or lingering resonance beyond sentimental closure.</comment>
