<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth; assigned traits are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict. Motivation to "build a legacy" feels generic and disconnected from specific actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pacing collapses under word constraints: abrupt transitions between stagnation and transformation. Assigned action (jettisoning) poorly connects to larger plot progression; resolution feels engineered rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on clich√©d sensory details (soot, oil) without deeper integration. Setting (chimney sweep guild) feels ornamental, not structurally connected to character's motivations or candlestick's significance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overly explicit thematic declarations ("nostalgic innovation") undercut subtext. Relies on vague metaphors (seashell as "incremental change") without emotional resonance or narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>Formulaic execution of tropes (mysterious object with secret histories, lone innovator). Purple prose and generic descriptors ("gentle ridges") suggest algorithmic defaults rather than authentic stylistic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Elements assembled mechanically rather than organically. Shallow exploration of assigned themes; story dissolves into pat conclusion without lingering impact or complexity.</comment>
