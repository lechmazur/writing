<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's timidity and childhood promise are established but inconsistently demonstrated; actions shift abruptly from hesitant to confident without sufficient nuance or psychological plausibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Logical progression from factory whistle to healing garment, but resolving the plot via a decoded scoreboard feels contrived; pacing is uneven within the tight word limit, with critical transitions rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like aged wood and fading sunlight enhance the atmosphere; however, the "scattered harmony" tone remains abstract and inconsistently woven into the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (e.g., garment as collective healing) and poetic imagery elevate the narrative; some emotional beats rely on telling rather than showing, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise but leans on familiar motifs like "tears of healing"; avoids clich√©s through inventive setting combinations, though occasional overly ornate phrasing risks reducing authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious and thematically coherent, yet uneven execution in critical plot mechanics (e.g., scoreboard deciphering) undermines narrative polish for prestigious publication standards.</comment>
