<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lacks distinct voice and underdeveloped personality; motivation to safeguard knowledge is clear but connects weakly to character specifics. Reactions to the scale reveal curiosity but not deeper traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot has surface coherence but lacks emotional payoff; safeguarding via scuffs drives action but ending feels rushed. Timeframe device creates false urgency with little narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vivid but fragmented imagery; floating market concept is underutilized spatially. Sensory details inconsistently anchor the mundane miracles tone. Forest trails emerge too late to deepen setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Imagery hints at themes but lacks follow-through; "cracked scale" symbolism diluted by anticlimactic verdict. Conflict resolution feels contrived; ending's philosophical statement appears abrupt, not earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by generic descriptors ("centuries-old marble floor") and overwritten phrases. Forest trails twist shows ingenuity but execution feels AI-derived in structural symmetry without emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elements present but loosely connected; story prioritizes stylistic flourishes over narrative integration. Theme of "unknown lens" lacks visceral embodiment through character/plot.</comment>
