<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks distinct personality or internal conflict; actions feel generic despite clear motivation. No meaningful development beyond surface traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Basic "discovery leads to innovation" arc functions but feels rushed; abrupt transitions between key moments dilute emotional weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (dust, light) contrasted with hollow historical context; setting isn't meaningfully connected to empire's collapse.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</comment>Nostalgia theme lacks emotional complexity; metaphors like "starlit conversations" are underdeveloped; ending relies on vague hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Riddled with AI-style clich√©s ("whispering stars," "sands of time") and inconsistent tone shifts; no subversion of fantasy tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elements assembled mechanically rather than organically; thematic throughlines feel imposed rather than emergent.</comment>
