<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character traits are overly symbolic; lacks personal history or nuanced motivation beyond thematic abstraction. Interaction with Alex feels contrived rather than revealing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows thematic logic but feels rushed in key transitions (quarantine's introduction, paddleboarding detour). Resolution ties back to central theme without full emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Contrasting ozone station and tattered flag provide visual texture, but sensory details remain superficial. Atmosphere evokes contemplation but lacks visceral immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbols like the flag carry thematic weight; subtext about freedom/safety resonates. Emotional impact diluted by abstract delivery rather than embodied experience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on flag-as-freedom trope; paddleboarding feels algorithmically inserted. Dialogue natural but unoriginal; "audacious meekness" explained rather than demonstrated. Avoids purple prose but leans on expected imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Element integration uneven: flag and quarantine serve story logic, but paddleboarding and ozone station feel forced. Themes present but execution lacks cohesive daring.</comment>
