<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The knight’s motivation to confront regret is clear but underdeveloped; his "grudgingly sweet" memories shape his actions superficially, lacking visceral emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot progresses through symbolic discoveries, but the tight word limit forces rushed transitions between introspection and action; coherence is maintained, though arcs feel compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The jagged reef and lighthouse prison create a haunting, tactile atmosphere, with evocative sensory details (e.g., “twisted beams,” “weight of sorrows”) enhancing mood and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (mirror, pattern) and subtext about transformation resonate, though some introspection veers into abstraction; the ending balances ambiguity and closure effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Despite uneven integration of elements, the story’s atmospheric cohesion and thematic hints of redemption through imperfection offer lingering resonance, albeit hindered by stylistic inconsistencies.</comment>
