<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's steel-clad emotional armor and transformation are conceptually clear but require more nuanced progression; motivation to soften aligns with arc but lacks gradual, believable causality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on adhesive analysis that feels contrived; pacing compresses pivotal shifts (bellowing, revelation), undermining emotional weight; coherence maintained but at cost of logical flow.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative setting juxtaposes mystique with buried optimism, but sensory details (gravehill air, greenhouse textures) insufficiently immersive; atmosphere supports theme but lacks visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Luminous metaphors (light bulb as hope, puzzle piece) and symbolic cohesion elevate impact, though excessive "showing" of emotional states (e.g., tears, weight lifting) weakens resonance; theme of transformation is clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Conceptual fusion of Tesla's bulb and witchy gravestones is inventive, but clichéd phrases ("arms of steel," "glow of light") and predictable emotional beats dilute originality; prose veers into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Core elements coexist but lack symbiotic urgency; brevity strains narrative—transformative moments feel imposed rather than earned; style exhibits ambition but inconsistent execution.</comment>
