<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's meekness lacks consistent behavioral evidence, motivation to escape isolation is underdeveloped, and reactions to the greeting card/tapestry feel more thematic than psychologically grounded. The "assertively meek" attribute remains ambiguously embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Arc exists but pacing feels compressed; firework moment as emotional pivot strains credulity. Connection between greeting card setup and resolution is effective, but the tight word limit leaves key transitions underelaborated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vivid but superficial descriptions; "mirage oasis" concept remains decorative rather than functional. Sensory details enrich mood but fail to create visceral immersion or thematic synergy with the setting's ephemeral nature.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry as tradition vs tech, labyrinth as isolation) are serviceable but predictable. Ending achieves emotional resonance through contrast between firework's impermanence and enduring stars, though reliance on stated "desperate optimism" weakens subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some clich√©s (firework as revelation, tapestry as heritage) tempered by lyrical precision. Avoids AI-manufactured transitions but occasionally substitutes ornate descriptions ("labyrinthine complexities") for deeper insight. Emotional arc feels crafted rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds as competent thematic exercise but lacks transformative vision. Assigned elements are dutifully integrated but rarely innovate or interrogate expectations. Lingering impression is thoughtful but not urgent.</comment>
