<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (preserving dances) are stated but not deeply explored; "nimble locksmith" profession is underutilized and disconnected from the core actions. Personality remains abstract, defined largely through poetic abstraction rather than meaningful choices or distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative lacks traditional plot structure; the story orbits a vague arc of "dancing through a storm" but lacks clear progression or resolution. Pacing alternates between overly deliberate descriptions and sudden, unearned emotional beats. Cause/effect relationships are often subsumed by atmospheric concerns.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Surreal setting creates vivid imagery (orchard on driftwood, storm of secrets), but logical coherence falters—how does an orchard float independently? Sensory details (sound of leaves, wind) effectively build mood, though over-reliance on "jaded wonder" adjectives occasionally distances immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphor and symbolic resonance (dances as cultural preservation, storm as revelation) elevate thematic depth. However, the ending feels abrupt rather than earned, and emotional impact is diluted by heavy-handed telling ("she knew she had succeeded"). Subtext about preservation vs. entropy remains compellingly ambiguous.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Prose veers toward purple at times ("tempest reshapes reality"), with formulaic phrases like "metaphysical presence stirring within." Attempts to subvert clichés (prancing as preservation act) are ambitious but occasionally overwritten. Emotional nuance is undercut by stating inner states rather than dramatizing them through choice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesion exists thematically (all elements orbiting "preservation through dance") but falters narratively. The tight word count forces abstraction over clarity, leaving key connections (why a locksmith? How yearbook research ties to dancing) underdeveloped. Lingers intellectually but feels structurally incomplete.</comment>
