<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (learning traditional methods) exists but lacks depth in how "dry-witted" trait shapes actions beyond detached observation; minimal emotional nuance or agency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves from discovery to revelation, but tango's role in driving the arc feels abrupt; "eroding promises" concept thinly connects beginning and end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting atmosphere amplified by sensory details (scent of saltwater, tango's melody), but setting's "haunted" aspect remains superficially explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (rope as eroded hope) and subtext (dance encoding secrets), but ending's reflective tone lacks emotional punch and thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés with dance-as-code twist; prose stylish without veering into excess. Some abstract phrasing ("spark of understanding") edges toward vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine into a thematically coherent, atmospheric narrative, though the story’s brevity leaves some threads (e.g., mysterious companion) underexplored.</comment>
