<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character's "hardheadedness" and "broken" state are stated but not deeply demonstrated through actions; shift from seeking power to finding solace feels underdeveloped and abrupt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc but feels rushed; cause/effect for the character's transformation lacks nuance despite fitting within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral ice sculptures and snow evoke impermanence, but sensory details are inconsistently vivid, dampening atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Imagery and theme of impermanence/harmony are strong, but emotional resonance is limited by overly abstract resolution; shows more than tells, yet lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on poetic clich√©s ("whisper tales," "delicate balance") and predictable tropes (traveler's epiphany); some metaphor freshness but leans on generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elements fit structurally but lack integration depth; lyrical style occasionally obscures clarity, but brief format serves the story's reflective tone.</comment>
