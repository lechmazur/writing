<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lin’s rationally impulsive trait isn’t strongly reflected in actions; motivations are stated but lack depth. The doll’s dress hints at symbolism but doesn’t fully anchor character nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Pacing is slow but consistent; the cold-case plot is mentioned but underexplored. Connection between beginning and end exists but feels underdeveloped, with resolution implied rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (aged wood, dust) create atmosphere, but the fusion of ancient palace and post-oil world feels superficial. Tone is evoked but lacks emotional integration with plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of transience and resilience are present, but emotional impact is muted. Metaphors are used (sunlight as hope), yet the narrative leans on descriptive “telling” over immersive showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overly poetic phrasing (“indomitable human spirit”) borders on cliché. Sensory details are generic; the mystery-solving method feels procedural rather than organically integrated. Metaphors lack freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are present but cohesively strained. The blend of era and genre undermines depth; the story feels like a stylistic exercise rather than a resonant narrative with a clear purpose.</comment>
