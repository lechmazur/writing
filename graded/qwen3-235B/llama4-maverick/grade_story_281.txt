<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains underdeveloped; motivation feels imposed rather than organic, with inconsistent reactions to the dummy. The "baffled pickpocket" trait fails to intersect meaningfully with the transformation arc, resulting in a disconnect between assigned attribute and action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks logical progression; transformation occurs without clear catalyst or stakes. Cause-effect relationships are muddled beneath poetic abstractions, and the ending feels unearned despite attempts at circularity between appointments.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is intermittently effective with mechanical noises and dim lighting but fails to leverage the lighthouse's history or timeframe ("between appointments") to deepen setting-character dynamics. Sensory details remain superficial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Story aims for metaphorical depth but relies on heavy-handed declarations rather than subtext. Literary devices feel strained (e.g., "scorching poise") rather than transformative. Conflict is abstract, leaving emotional impact underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Overused tropes (haunted objects, sudden metamorphosis) dominate without subversion. Formulaic phrases ("twisted wood and painted smile") and clich√©d emotional beats signal artificial construction. Lacks stylistic individuality or genuine nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Assigned elements are haphazardly stitched together; the dummy alone feels integral. The poetic method and timeframe undermine coherence. No lingering resonance emerges from the disjointed execution of themes.</comment>
