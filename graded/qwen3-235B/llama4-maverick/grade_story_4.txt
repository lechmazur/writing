<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond surface actions; motivation feels imposed rather than emerging organically. No distinct voice or psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a ritualistic arc but lacks causal progression. Mystical transformation lacks logical build-up, relying on atmospheric shifts rather than narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through synesthetic details, creating immersive otherworldliness. Setting acts as active participant in the ritualistic process.</comment>
