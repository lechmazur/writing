<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks development beyond static descriptors; motivations implied but not demonstrated through meaningful action or internal conflict. Coldly intense gaze feels like surface-level trait applied without psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot exists but follows predictable symbolic arc; cause-effect between ladder analysis and diary revelation feels contrived. Tight word limit exposes structural gaps between theater framing and forest narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Setting remains generic "fantasy-adjacent" tableau; ultraviolet forest description relies on buzzwords without sensory specificity. Dusty theater/theatrical glow contrast introduced then abandoned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious with thematic resonance about freedom, but emotional impact diluted by abstraction. Metaphors deployed at surface-level; ending lacks earned catharsis despite poetic diction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Relies heavily on clich√©d oppositions (freedom/security) and ornate abstraction. Many phrases ("salt and seaweed," "set reason ablaze") feel tropistically recycled rather than freshly imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements function as checklist rather than organic components. Theater framing device adds conceptual layer but weakens cohesion. Lingering thematic question over freedom exists, but lacks narrative substantiation.</comment>
