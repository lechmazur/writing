<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (cosmic lullaby) is clear but underdeveloped; actions align with trait but lack emotional depth and relatable internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure (night-to-dawn arc) but pacing feels hastily assembled; the middle lacks tension development despite the methodical task.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (e.g., sticky notes as cryptic messages) and overfamiliar tropes ("nightmares," "cosmic lullaby") without fully subverting expectations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but rarely synergize into cohesive thematic impact; brevity feels limiting rather than intentional.</comment>
