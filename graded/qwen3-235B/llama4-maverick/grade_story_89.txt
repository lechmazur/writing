<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character is defined by vague labels ("zealous," "confusing certainty") without depth, actions lack psychological nuance, and motivation is stated rather than demonstrated through conflict or emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as a sequence of abstract statements rather than a progression; repetitive phrasing substitutes for cause/effect, and the word limit exacerbates structural looseness without achieving cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on placeholder descriptors ("variable star observation deck," "rustled nail") that lack integration; sensory details are sparse and inconsistently linked to themes or character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Symbols (nail, capsules) are reiterated rather than meaningfully developed; writing leans on abstraction over immersive storytelling, resulting in minimal emotional resonance or thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Derivative phrasing ("chains of oppression," "whispers of ancient legends") and circular logic suggest formulaic structure; metaphors are generic, and tone shifts feel unearned rather than intentional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Assigned elements (capsules, nail, deck) are superficially present but form a checklist rather than organic components; lacks stylistic clarity, thematic cohesion, or lasting impression.</comment>
