<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character traits are stated rather than demonstrated; motivation lacks emotional depth; reactions feel superficially attached to plot points; unclear how "underdog" status shapes actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; cause-effect between artifact decoding and uprising is underdeveloped; pacing unevenly prioritizes vague ambition over narrative momentum; ending feels abrupt rather than resonant.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting details are present but generic; sensory immersion underutilized; tone/setting disconnect—gritty spaceport clashes with mystical rebellion themes; countdown timer adds eerie tension but remains underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Relies on clichéd revolutionary imagery without subverting it; metaphors (frozen countdown as stalled revolution) are surface-level; minimal subtext; ending lacks emotional payoff despite ambitious themes; prose leans on "showy" descriptors over visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("drainingly invigorated") feels affected; repetitive use of "rebellious placidity" as a narrative crutch; generic references to "uprising" echo predictable tropes; fails to distinguish human nuance from AI-adjacent abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements included but loosely interwoven; style prioritizes atmospheric vagueness over clarity; brevity serves neither cohesion nor thematic depth; lacks innovative synthesis of components into a singular, compelling vision.</comment>
