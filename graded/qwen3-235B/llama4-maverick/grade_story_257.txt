<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character traits are present but underdeveloped; motivation feels somewhat abstract rather than rooted in tangible struggles. The "overqualified" aspect lacks emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structurally sound with a clear arc, but progression feels rushed; restoration of chalkboard and thematic resolution occur without sufficient narrative tension or incremental steps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (fireflies, autumn) but sensory details remain generic; emotional resonance of "bruised exhilaration" isn't fully embodied in the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Effective use of symbolism (chalkboard/postcard metaphors) and lyrical imagery; themes of reinvention and hidden narratives resonate, but emotional payoff lacks visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid moments compete with predictable tropes (e.g., mystical fireflies, "dormant self" clich√©); prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but retains a distinct voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohere but lack organic integration; the story feels conceptually ambitious yet emotionally distant, with promising but unfulfilled thematic potential.</comment>
