<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed. Cause-effect between using lamp and monster's transformation lacks development. Beginning-end connection exists but resolution feels abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Naptime atmosphere creates hushed mood but underutilized. Stained glass lamp provides vivid imagery, but the pattern recognition center remains vague. Tone of earnest mockery isn't fully reflected in setting.</comment>
