<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (decoding inscriptions) is clear but underexplored; minimal emotional depth or evolution; "bleary-eyed" is descriptive but doesn't shape actions; reliance on cryptic sensations over tangible character logic weakens engagement</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot lacks causality between key elements (e.g., cutlass discovery doesn't trigger concrete stakes); pacing stilted in tight word limit; connection between coffee grounds and temple decoding feels arbitrary; superficial "arc" without meaningful resolution</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ambient details (glinting cutlass, hushed horizon) create mood but fail to integrate digital nomads meaningfully; anachronistic blend of tech and antiquity underdeveloped; inconsistent sensory grounding (e.g., how does coffee taste? What sounds populate the camp?)</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Surface-level symbolic gestures (coffee grounds, cutlass as "talisman") without deeper thematic payoff; tone shifts erratically between mystical awe and dispassionate observation; ending lacks emotional or intellectual resonance; relies on vague "unfinished tales" mystique without substance</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Overreliance on clich√©d motifs (buried relic, cryptic map); florid phrases ("hush of horizon's edge") suggest formulaic writing; character decisions hinge on passive "pulls" or magical intuitions rather than human logic; tone inconsistently oscillates between poetic and clinical</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elements (cutlass, camp, coffee) exist side-by-side without cohesive synthesis; stylistic flourishes prioritize atmosphere over narrative propulsion; brevity feels restrictive, not deliberate; fails to leverage tight word limit for impactful, focused storytelling.</comment>
