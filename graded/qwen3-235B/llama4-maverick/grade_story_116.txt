<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character remains abstract; motivations stated but not deeply explored. Lacks distinct voice despite first-person implications. Reactions to objects feel symbolic but not psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Non-linear progression; plot exists as internalized journey without external stakes or transformation. Tension arises from character's fixation but lacks concrete resolution beyond completion of the map.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Richly imagined atmosphere with vivid sensory details (e.g., "black velvet sky-lounge"), though worldbuilding feels decorative rather than integrated with narrative purpose. Setting amplifies mood but doesn't drive action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (time fluidity, memory as excavation) coexist with overwritten passages. Emotional resonance limited by cerebral tone. Strong imagery but lacks gut-level impact. Theme of mapping chaos feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Excessive reliance on poetic abstractions ("tapestry of secrets") and stock phrases ("labyrinth of lights"). Mechanical repetition of motifs (e.g., "endless night") suggests formulaic structure beneath surface elegance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements artificially grafted together. Story prioritizes aesthetic cohesion over organic integration of components. Creates atmospheric vignette rather than cohesive narrative with lasting impact.</comment>
