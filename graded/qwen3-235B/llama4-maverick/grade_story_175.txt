<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (forbidden knowledge) is clear but underexplored; "feral elegance" and mischievousness hinted through metaphors but lack concrete behavioral evidence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has cyclical structure but relies heavily on repetitive imagery; progression feels static despite the word limit; resolution lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eerie, melancholic atmosphere created through sensory details (chipped paint, whispering), but the "mushroom village" setting remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (birdcage, sign) and thematic resonance about transience; occasionally drifts into abstraction rather than showing visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on poetic repetition that risks feeling self-indulgent; inconsistent tone shifts between mythic and melancholic register.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually, but execution lacks urgency; the ending lingers thematically without deepening the narrative's emotional stakes.</comment>
