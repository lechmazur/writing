<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivation exists but isn't emotionally grounded. Actions consistent with traits but lack human nuance. No distinct voice. Doesn't evolve beyond archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Loose structure with disconnected vignettes. Climax and resolution feel arbitrary rather than earned. Pacing uneven - rushed ritual despite ample atmospheric setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Richly textured world with vivid sensory details in setting descriptions. Banyan-based metropolis and surreal farm imagery create strong atmosphere but insufficiently connected to character arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Original premise with familiar archetypes. Repetitive descriptive patterns ("whimsical," "phantasmal") appear AI-influenced. Emotional resonance remains superficial despite inventive elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Story lacks narrative cohesion despite rich parts. Attempts to blend poetic elements with character journey but fails to synthesize them into unified whole with meaningful momentum.</comment>
