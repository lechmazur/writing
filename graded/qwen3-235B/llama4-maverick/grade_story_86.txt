<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Archery prowess mentioned but disconnected from emotional struggle. Flashback feels arbitrary rather than revealing character motivation. Actions lack tangible connection to "usually exceptional" trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between cyberpunk present and balloon festival memory weakens coherence. Resolution arrives too conveniently without earned transformation. Pacing unevenly blends verbose description with abrupt shifts.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cyberpunk setting reduced to generic neon/machinery tropes. Sparse sensory details inconsistently applied. Atmosphere attempts contrast between hi-tech and candlelight but fails to create distinctive immersive world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Clich√©d metaphors ("dancing neon") lack subtext. Explicitly stated emotions dominate over demonstrated psychological complexity. Ending's "hope" feels unearned rather than thought-provoking. Minimal thematic density.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Relies heavily on purple prose and overwrought phrasing ("across bones of ancient timeline"). Predictable contrasts between light/dark. Symbolism feels algorithmically generated rather than deliberately constructed. Emotional beats are surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Forced integration of elements creates disjointed narrative. Brief length exacerbates structural weaknesses. Lacks innovative synthesis of cyberpunk setting and human elements. Leaves no lingering resonance.</comment>
