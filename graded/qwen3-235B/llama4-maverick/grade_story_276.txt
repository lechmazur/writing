<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character lacks distinct voice; motivation to 'learn universal patterns' feels abstract and unexplored. Unease is superficial, with minimal development or nuanced reactions tied to assigned traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but is slight; pacing lags mid-section. Plot relies on generic 'realization' without concrete resolution. Coherence maintained but lacks tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setting underutilized; orbital station's technical specifics are mentioned but atmospherically inert. Sparse sensory details fail to immerse beyond fridge postcards and coathanger sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Symbols like coathanger gesture at thematic weight but remain underdeveloped. Ending's 'peace' feels unearned. Literary devices are surface-level, with minimal emotional resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on clich√©d phrases ('web of relationships', 'fragile connections') and predictable emotional beats. Attempts poetic tone but veers into generic 'feel-good' didacticism. No distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements superficially cohesive but lack narrative ambition. The brief length exposes underdevelopment rather than serving as artistic choice. Leaves no lingering insight beyond vague 'human connection matters' platitude.</comment>
