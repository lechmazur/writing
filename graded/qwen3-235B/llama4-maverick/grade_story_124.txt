<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's transformation lacks emotional depth; motivation feels abstract rather than organically revealed. The skittishness diminishes too abruptly without clear psychological progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven - loom-weaving climax feels rushed despite meticulous setup. The resolution relies too heavily on vague spiritual energy rather than character-driven causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Immersive lunar details undercut by inconsistent tone - juxtaposition of hi-tech colony with primitive loom lacks narrative rationale. Sensory elements create atmosphere but strain credibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (loom as psyche) but execution leans on clich√©d metaphors. The ending's thematic resonance is undercut by overly cryptic language that obscures emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by purple prose ("subconscious mind unfurling like a lotus"). Some original tactile details lost in sea of abstract, self-consciously literary phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but strained cohesion - lunar setting and pioneer action feel arbitrarily linked. Lingering questions about loom's symbolic function remain frustratingly vague.</comment>
