<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Lack of depth in claustrophobia's influence; motivation stated but underdeveloped. Character nuance minimal despite thematic potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc from anxiety to peace, but plot relies on predictable epiphany structure. Pacing adequate within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on generic 'serene' descriptors. Sensory details (sunlight patterns, jams) present but insufficiently vivid to ground world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (jam-making as human connection) elevate subtext. Ending resonates thematically but lacks emotional urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes. Occasional ornate phrasing ("lightly heavyhearted") skirts clich√© but mostly subverts expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Attempts to weave elements cohesively, but some (claustrophobia) feel appended rather than integral to narrative momentum.</comment>
