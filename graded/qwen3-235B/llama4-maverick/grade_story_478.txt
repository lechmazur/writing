<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (recover stolen memories) is clear, but "openly secretive" trait remains superficially stated rather than demonstrated through distinct behaviors. Actions align with plot needs but lack psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a recovery arc but feels compressed rather than cohesive. The pivotal action (reading diaries) lacks tension. Cause/effect connections exist but lack visceral impact due to limited character emotional investment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orchard island and maelstrom create strong visual contrast, but atmosphere remains atmospheric rather than thematic. Sensory details (lavender/chamomile) effective but sparse. The waxing moon motif isn't fully integrated beyond timekeeping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors about burned pages and growing wisdom provide depth. The ending achieves thematic resolution but feels predetermined rather than earned. Subtext about women's hidden histories is promising but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Some poetic phrasing ("fluttering like wounded birds") elevates prose, while phrases like "dissonant calm" feel like concept-checking. The premise shows imagination but follows a familiar healing-trauma template without distinctive reworking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Most elements are present but service plot rather than theme. The brief length limits emotional weight, though the concept of memory's physical remnants has potential. Ending lacks urgency or revelation despite stated resolution.</comment>
