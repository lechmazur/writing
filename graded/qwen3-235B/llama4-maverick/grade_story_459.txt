<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's profession and ghostly encounters inform his introspection, but emotional arc feels compressed; motivations tied to silence/dissonance are present but lack gradual development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from observation to realization, but transitions between lab, elevators, and ghost tours lack grounding; resolution feels abrupt despite thematic alignment.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting contrasts (elevators vs. lab) evoke mood, but sensory details are sparse; atmosphere supports themes but lacks visceral immersion or unique worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Symbols (flower crown, silence) carry thematic weight, but emotional resonance is uneven; ending offers closure without fully earned catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unusual combinations (e.g., sand castle lab), but abstract phrasing ("complex simplicity") risks sounding formulaic; character psychology leans overly logical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story integrates elements cohesively but relies on surface-level connections; thematic depth is evident but under-actualized within the strict word limit.</comment>
