<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Poor integration of the "aloof" trait into actions or decisions; motivation (transforming fear) is stated but not organically demonstrated through nuanced behavior or internal conflict resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Actions drive personal transformation, but gravitational anomaly feels extraneous and underdeveloped, weakening causal logic and pacing balance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on vague sensory details (hum, stones) without immersive environmental specificity; gravitational anomaly's symbolic link to emotion lacks textual grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (stones as resilience, cleaning as emotional sorting) and thematic cohesion elevate the story, though emotional impact is diluted by over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gravitational anomaly offers originality but is underutilized; some clich√©d phrasing ("journey undertaken") and overly explicit thematic statements undermine subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mix of compelling symbolic arcs (stones, cleaning) and jarring elements (anomaly, lottery ticket) creates uneven cohesion; brevity sacrifices depth without feeling deliberate.</comment>
