<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character’s fierce loyalty and motivation to meditate remain abstract; actions during radicalization feel unearned and inconsistent with established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is minimally coherent but rushed—the sudden shift to radicalization strains pacing and undermines the story’s arc within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The moth observation tower’s “sanctified dread” atmosphere is hinted but underdeveloped; sensory details are present but lack immersive depth or thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ideas about transformation and balance offer conceptual interest, but emotional impact is diluted by passive character engagement and overreliance on symbolic shorthand.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Combines unusual elements (fierce scout, radicalizing comedian) with mixed success; some tropes (“inner storms,” light vs. darkness) feel derivative rather than fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Story hinges on forced juxtapositions (meditation vs. radicalization) and uneven integration of elements, suggesting a framework that prioritizes assigned elements over organic narrative flow.</comment>
