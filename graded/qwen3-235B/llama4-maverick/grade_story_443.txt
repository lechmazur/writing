<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Character's heartbreak is evident, but her role as a reaper is superficial; motivations lack depth and coherence, and the narrative voice fails to establish uniqueness or internal conflict tied to her identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Pacing is uneven, with abrupt transitions between discovery and action; the connection between the novel draft and mapping springs feels forced, undermining plot logic and completeness within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative through sensory details (water echoes, yellowed pages), but the cave’s symbolic relevance to the reaper’s role or the theme of evolving relationships remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Literary devices like metaphor are present but clichéd (e.g., fog lifting, tree branches); emotional resonance is diluted by overuse of abstract description rather than vivid, character-specific action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Relies on overused tropes (melancholy reaper, mystical cave) and contrived elements (bird-dropped seeds); subtext is surface-level, with formulaic transitions and insufficiently nuanced emotional exploration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Ambient mood is strong, but assigned elements (e.g., seeds, evolving relationships) often feel arbitrarily inserted, weakening cohesion and thematic impact despite imaginative premises.</comment>
