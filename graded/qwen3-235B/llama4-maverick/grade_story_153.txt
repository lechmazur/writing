<question>1</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Paper-thin character with no interiority or growth, defined entirely by flat adjectives. Actions are inert tableaux rather than motivated behavior, with no discernible emotional arc or psychological complexity. The "student" exists solely as a vessel for abstract concepts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Plot is a static tableau without cause-effect progression or meaningful structure. The "journey" happens entirely in conceptual space with no narrative tension or earned resolution. Arbitrary end point lacks narrative consequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Murky, inconsistent atmosphere mixing scientific collapse with mystical undertones. Superficial sensory details (headlamp's glow) fail to ground the reader in a vivid, living world despite promising premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Uses chiaroscuro imagery effectively with light/dark motifs, but over-reliance on passive voice and observational distance flattens engagement. The central metaphor of "light in darkness" gains some traction but remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Overuses derivative science-fantasy tropes (immortality, multiverse) without subversion. Stilted adverb-heavy prose and formulaic phrases ("endless void," "flickering hope") evoke algorithmic writing patterns rather than organic creativity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Elements incorporated as checklist items rather than organic components. The constrained form exposes narrative underdevelopment and failure to synthesize disparate elements into cohesive thematic whole. Emotional inertia dominates.</comment>
