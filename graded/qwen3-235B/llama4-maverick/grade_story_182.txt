<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vague motivations and underdeveloped internal logic. Protagonist acts as a passive vessel for poetic imagery rather than a psychologically coherent figure; reactions feel imposed rather than organically derived from established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Fractured pacing due to compressed word limit. Revelation-to-resolution arc exists but feels mechanically assembled; cause-effect relationships gloss over crucial transitions between discovery and transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically superficial. Atmospheric details (projector light, spoon's tarnish) engage senses, but magnetic mountain's mystical potential remains cursorily exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beautifully cadenced prose masks shallow thematic engagement. Metaphors like "churning through grime" resonate, but lacks sustained emotional stakes or subtextual complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tropes masquerading as innovation. "Frolicsome regret" and "quiet hunger" read as overwritten affectations rather than authentic emotional textures; magnetic mountain concept feels algorithmically selected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Surface gloss outweighs substance. Incorporates assigned elements with mechanical precision, but brevity sacrifices narrative depth; stylistic polish cannot fully compensate for existential lightness.</comment>
