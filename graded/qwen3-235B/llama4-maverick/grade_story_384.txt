<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character motivation lacks grounding; frantic actions feel imposed rather than organically linked to "root of illusions". Sudden shift to "frenzied tranquility" lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on convenient discoveries (letters, stick) without narrative tension. Pacing lurches between action beats. Ending feels tacked-on, lacking earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dense sensory atmosphere (lavender, dusty textures) effectively builds claustrophobic mystery. Seismic setting and tactile details create visceral immersion despite underdeveloped worldbuilding logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Metaphor of "illusions in perception" is superficial. Overwrought phrases ("impossibly conceivable") overshadow thematic potential. Ending's "nourishing both body and soul" feels trite, undercutting earlier mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Artificially poetic language ("frantic cook frantically searched") and contradictory terms ("frenzied tranquility") suggest formulaic writing. Sensory details overly rely on sight/smell at expense of embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elements forced into symbolic roles strain credibility. Short form exposes narrative scaffolding. Theoretical weight ("root of illusions") remains abstract rather than visceral, losing impact.</comment>
