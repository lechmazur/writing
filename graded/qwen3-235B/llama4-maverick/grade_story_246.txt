<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but underdeveloped; "discreetly flagrant" traits aren't consistently demonstrated. Relationship with object lacks depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical but rushed; cause-effect relationships exist but feel superficial. The polymerization concept drives the plot but feels contrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but inconsistent; sensory details are unevenly distributed. Magnetic anomaly and "crumbling peace" are conceptually present but underutilized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uncommon premise but inconsistent execution. Some poetic phrasing ("crumbling peace") contrasts with generic descriptions. Polymerization as magical method avoids tropes but lacks scientific or symbolic rigor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overambitious element integration creates artificial cohesion. Story struggles under the weight of imposed constraints; brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful.</comment>
