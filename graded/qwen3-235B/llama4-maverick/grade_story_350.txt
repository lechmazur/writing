<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Lacks substantial internalization or conflict; the "irritatingly perfect" trait remains superficial, never evolving into a psychological dimension. Motivation lacks urgency or personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmentary progression substitutes atmosphere for narrative; the action-to-resolution ratio is inverted. Arbitrary shifts between marionettes, stamps, and gown disrupt causal logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere through scent (incense) and tactile details (residue), but the ancient Greek temple serves as vague backdrop rather than active spatial construct.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphor density creates haunting texture, but emotional engagement remains peripheral. The "truth" concept floats abstractly; the ending resolves nothing, rendering impact ephemeral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Reliance on mannered descriptive clusters ("whispers of a forgotten symphony") and repetitive abstract pairings ("symphonies of truth") suggests formulaic processing rather than organic discovery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Element integration demonstrates conceptual ambition but executes as thematic collage. The "wedding gown" and "puzzle event" linger as disconnected symbols without narrative necessity.</comment>
