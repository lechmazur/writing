<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation hinted through symbols (highlighter, butterflies), but lacks depth in showing how attributes like 'unjustly fair' tangibly shape decisions or interactions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure is circular rather than developmental; the action of decoding signals drives minimal progression, with coherence maintained through poetic repetition rather than cause-effect momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative but uneven—steampunk details feel superficial; the 'battered marvel' tone clashes with more lyrical descriptions, weakening immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterflies as hope, 'battered marvels') are present but inconsistently layered; emotional impact relies too heavily on declarative statements rather than subtext or nuanced imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality is undercut by clichéd emotional cues (red eyes, wistful smiles) and inconsistent tone; the highlighter pen feels anachronistic, undermining the steampunk authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Holds thematic promise with its conceptual elements but sacrifices narrative cohesion and character depth for atmospheric flourishes; memorable for imagery, not structure.</comment>
