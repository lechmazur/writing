<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations lack depth; silent agreement drives the plot but feels underexplored, with emotional resilience stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot is coherent but simplistic; justification drives action yet causal links (e.g., blood drive encounter’s stakes) are underdeveloped, with resolution feeling abrupt due to word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich, immersive atmosphere through vivid sensory details (eerie silence, bleeding daylight, botanical visuals) creates haunting Gothic mood; setting deeply enhances tension and thematic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and symbolism elevate the narrative, while the ending resonates with lingering foreboding. Conflict is impactful but lacks layered emotional exploration for deeper resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés in atmosphere but relies on predictable Gothic tropes; blood drive subplot feels contrived. Language occasionally veers into ornate phrasing without subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere but unevenly; some (botanical collection, haunted mansion) are integral, while others (blood drive) feel forced. Themes of secrecy and power are clear but superficially treated.</comment>
