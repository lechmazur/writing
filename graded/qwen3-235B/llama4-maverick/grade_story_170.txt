<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's free-spiritedness and academic-artistry lack concrete manifestations; motivations tied to shame feel abstract rather than demonstrated through specific actions. The sewing kit's ancestral significance is introduced but underdeveloped in shaping her choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear emotional arc, but the abandoned wall's timeframe isn't meaningfully integrated into the narrative. The memorization of letters drives the resolution, though cause-effect between external tasks and internal healing remains under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details about coral and ocean light create immersion, but the coral restoration station's thematic connection to Luna's emotional restoration is implied rather than explicitly woven. Timeframe's stillness contrasts effectively with inner turmoil.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (shame as hollow echoes, healing as mending) elevate the story, but emotional depth remains surface-level. The ending's closure feels earned yet predictable. Subtext about ancestral wisdom is present but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>While avoiding overt clich√©s, descriptions like "breathless longing" lean on poetic abstractions rather than unique imagery. The coral/sewing duality is conceptually interesting but could gain originality through more specific, visceral details. Prose occasionally dips into ornate phrasing that dilutes emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The story successfully incorporates most elements but struggles to fuse them into a unified whole. The abandoned wall timeline and academic-artistry attribute feel like checklist items rather than organic narrative drivers. Strong atmosphere and conceptual resonance prevent a complete cohesion failure.</comment>
