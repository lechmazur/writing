<question>1</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Character's zealotry is entirely unearned; "mild" contradicts the obsessional behavior described. No discernible internal life or contradictions to create depth. Motivation for studying currency as sacrifice is stated, not demonstrated through action or conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>No plot progression - merely circles around static imagery. Begins/ends with identical posture and mindset. The "quest" is purely abstract; no obstacles or revelations occur within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on decorative adjectives ("chaotic beauty") rather than specific sensory details. The lab's "strange attractor" concept isn't meaningfully connected to the currency. Rustic refinement contradicts the juxtaposition of modern/antique equipment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Over-reliance on clich√©d abstractions ("whispers of the past"). No earned emotional resonance; the "truth" and "legacy" remain vague. Fails to subvert surface-level description of objects into deeper thematic exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("foreign paper money spread out before him >" with jarring line breaks) suggests formulaic writing. Metaphors about legacy feel generic. The "strange attractor" device is underdeveloped and unoriginal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Characters, setting, and themes exist in parallel rather than intersecting meaningfully. The lab equipment and shifting political context feel arbitrarily assembled. Leverages none of its brevity to create impactful compression.</comment>
