<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Riddled with vague emotional descriptions like "passionate disinterest" without concrete behavioral evidence; character remains an abstract concept rather than a living entity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Predictable metaphorical arc lacks tangible events; "confronting regrets" remains abstract, and the ending feels arbitrarily imposed rather than organically earned within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Surreal setting elements (inverted waterfall, celestial motifs) are inert backdrops rather than active forces shaping the narrative, relying on overused poetic shorthand rather than visceral detail.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Over-reliance on trite symbolism (bridge of regret, transformative objects) undermines emotional impact; attempts at thematic depth are surface-level, with no subtext or original perspective conveyed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Formulaic phrasing ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "spark of creativity") and reliance on clich√©d metaphors betray AI-generated patterns; emotional arcs are explicitly stated rather than subtly shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements are forced into checklist compliance rather than organic integration; the brevity exposes structural fragility rather than showcasing economy of expression as a deliberate art.</comment>
