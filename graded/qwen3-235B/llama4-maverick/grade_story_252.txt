<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lack of personal voice in third-person limits character depth; motivation is clear but emotional complexity is underdeveloped despite symbolic actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure exists but feels abbreviated; the petal-tracking method provides forward momentum through poetic gesture rather than narrative logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (decaying fruits, cold atmosphere) create mood but fail to integrate fully with metaphysical concepts; setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active narrative participant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism elevates surface narrative; thematic tension between creation/destruction and memory/preservation adds resonance, though emotional impact remains diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some purple prose tendencies ("sterile prison had become a womb") and under-subverted concepts (crack in reality) appear, though metaphoric integration of petal-tracking and memory restoration shows conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements form cohesive symbolic system but lack narrative urgency; thematic ambition exceeds emotional payoff within constrained form.</comment>
