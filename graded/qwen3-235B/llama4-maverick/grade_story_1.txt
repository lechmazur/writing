<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's phobia and stunt double profession are stated but not deeply explored; motivation to face fears is vaguely connected to profession; transitions from fear to triumph lack psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses through episodic discoveries but lacks causal cohesion; tight word limit compresses key moments, sacrificing organic transitions and emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere creates visual and sensory intrigue (e.g., "aged parchment"), but setting's symbolic potential remains underexploited; connections between environment and character psychology are superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (net = fears) are conceptually clear but emotionally inert; resolution feels preordained rather than earned, with themes of redemption underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Relys on generic "haunted protagonist finds redemption" trope; repetitive phrases ("echoes in the dark," "numb fascination") and exaggerated emotional shifts suggest mechanical writing patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist side-by-side rather than interlocking cohesively; attempts at thematic depth are undermined by rushed execution and lack of narrative spontaneity.</comment>
