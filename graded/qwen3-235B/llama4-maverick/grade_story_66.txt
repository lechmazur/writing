<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but abstract; lacks concrete emotional nuance. Actions align with traits but remain more symbolic than lived, with sparse distinct voice despite introspective narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on repetitive cycles of reconstruction/destruction. Fragmentary structure undermines cohesion; beginning-end connection exists but feels artificial. Pacing drags in midsection despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere created through sensory details (damp earth, machinery hum) effectively anchors the dissonant setting. However, plant communication remains underexplored as an interactive element, weakening integration with character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (mirrors, masks, carbonization) create thematic consistency. Ending subverts expectations by resolving the object while leaving the quest unresolved. Tension between belonging and loss remains potent but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally leans on abstract phrasing ("noble foolishness") instead of embodied conflict. Originality shines in mask reconstruction/carbonization ritual but stumbles in mechanical descriptions ("dizzyingly grounded").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>High concept density creates cohesion struggles; some elements feel forced (plant communication). Brief length highlights poetic fragmentation but sacrifices emotional payoff. Lingering questions about identity and impermanence suggest thematic ambition.</comment>
