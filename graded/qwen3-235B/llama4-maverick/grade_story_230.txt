<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks depth beyond stated traits. Compassion isn't demonstrated through action, only told. Motivation exists but isn't emotionally grounded, making reactions feel generic rather than personally specific.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is functional but lacks narrative tension. The rivet alignment method feels arbitrary rather than logically connected to locket's unlocking. Pacing is uneven with rushed resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Mishmash of espionage and fantasy elements creates tonal dissonance. Sensory details are present but generic ("dimly lit," "soft hum") without immersive specificity. Setting-object connection feels forced.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Attempts symbolism through objects/light but lacks thematic resonance. The "hopeful brutality" tone remains abstract rather than visceral. Writing style leans on clich√©d phrases rather than showing nuanced emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Relies on fantasy tropes without subversion. "Precisely messy" phrase repeated like a crutch. Submarine-rivet method feels algorithmically selected rather than organically conceived. Emotional impact is surface-level.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements exist collaterally, not synergistically. Short form feels restrictive rather than purposeful. No lingering thematic resonance. Style prioritizes description over meaningful progression.</comment>
