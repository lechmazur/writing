<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Character remains largely passive, motivations articulated but unearned; introspective epiphany feels abrupt and generic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but lacks tension; transitions between memories and present feel underdeveloped for word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Setting elements (lava lamp, incense) offer mild atmosphere but lack distinctive sensory anchoring; tone inconsistent in quieter moments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elements are stitched together mechanically; themes of freedom could resonate but remain abstract rather than visceral.</comment>
