<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Summoner's motivation to outshine reflection drives actions, but lacks psychological depth. "Corroded rapture" feels superficially applied rather than organically developed through specific behaviors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from discovery to spectacle with satisfying shape, but cause-effect connections between elements (demolition, summoning) remain underdeveloped. Pacing maintains momentum without deepening stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (salt/death odors, luminescence) create immersive mood, but quantum beach concept remains undefined abstraction. Atmospheric connections support the corroded rapture tone but lack functional worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vibrant metaphors ("kaleidoscope of color") create visual impact. Subtext about creation/destruction duality emerges clearly. Emotional resonance remains surface-level due to character thinness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing ("corroded rapture," "quantum beach") creates artificial depth. Tropes like ancestral map quests and last-minute disappearances feel algorithmically patterned rather than freshly imagined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements included but unevenly integrated. Quantum aspects and demolition framing feel like decorative add-ons rather than organic components. Strongest cohesion in map/light motif.</comment>
