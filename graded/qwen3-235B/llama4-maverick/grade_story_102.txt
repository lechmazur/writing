<question>1</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Spineless trait is stated but underexplored; transformation feels abrupt and insufficiently demonstrated through specific actions or choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but pacing stumbles under word limit; mentorship and prophecy resolution feel rushed despite atmospheric setup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vivid details like "scent of aged paper" create immersive atmosphere, but connections between objects (dollhouse key) and central themes remain underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Riddled with clich√©d phrasing ("luminous doubt," "uncharted horizons") and predictable redemption arc; fails to subvert common tropes or establish distinctive voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise shows potential but execution feels checklist-driven; elements coexist without synergistic impact or lingering emotional resonance.</comment>
