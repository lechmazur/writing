<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic but thinly developed; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or decisions. The assigned attribute of "distant intimacy" shapes surface behavior but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional conflict or progression; tension between mystical insight and human connection is implied but never dramatized. The cyclical structure works within word limits but risks feeling static rather than purposefully resolved.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The reimagined castle and meteor showers create vivid imagery, but the atmosphere relies more on poetic description than tangible sensory immersion (e.g., sounds of art classes, textures of crumbling stone). "Distant intimacy" tone is consistent but abstract.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Story achieves lyrical cohesion through recurring symbols (flowers, meteors, threads). The ending resonates thematically but could deepen emotional impact via specific character reactions. Subtext about connection is present but understated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending herbalism with celestial divination, avoiding genre tropes. Some phrases tilt toward ornate abstraction ("dramatically subtle curves"), and character psychology remains elusive, but the voice maintains distinctiveness without veering into artificiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elegantly written but prioritizes atmosphere over narrative urgency. Assigned elements are skillfully woven into the setting but rarely generate friction or evolution. Leaves a lingering impression without demanding immediate publication.</comment>
