<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's assigned attributes and motivation are present but underdeveloped; the astronomer's "rationally organic" logic dominates without depth, and their lack of emotional engagement undermines the symbolic resolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a rudimentary arc from task to triumph but lacks cohesive progression; the snowflake's role in driving action is stated rather than demonstrated, and the ending feels abrupt, with no tangible evidence of the "cultivated hope" impacting the world.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Visually striking setting with immersive sensory details (e.g., "crystal-encrusted horizon," shifting ice) creates a haunting, emotionally sterile atmosphere that complements the theme of decay and renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic imagery (snowflakes, idol of fear) but limited thematic resonance; the story leans on abstract concepts rather than earned emotional or narrative weight, and the ending is underwhelming in its detachment.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly ornate prose ("rationally organic marvel," "crystal shadows") borders on self-parody; repetitive phrasing ("fragility," "patterns") and logical inconsistencies (emotionless protagonist inspiring "hope") undermine originality and authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Visually cohesive but narratively inert; the storyâ€™s conceptual framework forces elements into symbolic roles without organic integration, leaving a sense of artificiality despite ambitious thematic intentions.</comment>
