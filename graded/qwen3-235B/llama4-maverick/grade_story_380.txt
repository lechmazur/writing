<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Minimal interiority undermines motivation; fragmented self concept lacks concrete behavioral manifestations; actions disconnected from mathematically challenged trait; no distinct narrative voice in third-person perspective</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Repetitive circularity instead of forward momentum; "plunge" resolution feels arbitrary rather than earned; superficial cause-effect throughline; pacing lags in establishing emotional stakes within constrained structure</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere sustained through sensory fragments, but setting remains decorative rather than thematic; treehouse creaks replicate psychological tension but lack organic connection to core concepts; temporal context underexploited</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Storm metaphor gains symbolic resonance; lingering questions about memory's transience; showing through objects (album, silence) competes with excessive existential telling; emotionally resonant potential diluted by abstraction</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Reliance on post-apocalyptic clich√©s ("unraveling world," "whispers on wind"); generic descriptors ("crumbling craggy peak"); mechanical repetition of "fragmented self" concept; inconsistent handling of mania through diffuse lyrical abstraction</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements feel collaged rather than integrated; brevity works against thematic complexity; creative ambition exceeds execution; emotional weight undermined by conceptual murkiness; leaves intriguing images but shallow residue</comment>
