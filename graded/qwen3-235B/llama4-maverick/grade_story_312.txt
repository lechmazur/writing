<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's agoraphobia is surface-level; motivations tied to inherited burdens exist but lack psychological depth, making emotional resonance elusive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is present but strained by word limit; key actions (pressing switch, walking toward future) feel sudden, undercutting narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sensory details (rain, dunes) create atmosphere, but "realistically fanciful" setting remains underexplored, weakening thematic linkage to character's inner state.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracked dam, shedding skin) add depth, and the ending is thematically purposeful, though emotional arcs lean on abstraction rather than precise "showing."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose veers into ornate territory ("soothing serenade," "fabric of her reality"), while tropes like the magical heirloom and redemptive rain feel uninspired despite minor twists.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Element integration is uneven; the structure feels strained by imposed constraints rather than intentionally concise, leaving themes of liberation feeling underdeveloped.</comment>
