<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character's astral projection ability lacks concrete influence on actions; motivation is explicitly stated rather than demonstrated through behavior or choices; emotional depth remains abstract and unearned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Plot progresses coherently but lacks visceral tension; cause/effect relationships feel artificial (revelation doesn't translate to urgent action); pacing is steady but lacks dynamic escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Setting has surface-level atmospheric details ("whispers of the past") but relies on clich√©d decay imagery; ambient mood exists without integrating with character psychology or thematic weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Uses symbolic objects (key as compassion) and reflective tone, but abstract introspections substitute for genuine emotional subtext; ending feels didactic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Purple prose abounds ("tangible reminder of unyielding compassion"); repetitive descriptors ("rusting," "whispers") and predictable atmospheric choices suggest formulaic writing; attempts to be profound through abstraction rather than original observation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements present but mechanically layered rather than organically synthesized; style prioritizes declarative profundity over immersive storytelling; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful.</comment>
