<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Detachment is evident but lacks psychological depth; vow’s motivation feels abstract rather than visceral, though actions align with established traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linear progression from search to creation to departure provides structure, but the compressed arc feels underdeveloped; cause-effect is logical but stakes remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Achieves vivid immersion through sensory details (machinery hum, paint textures) and the setting’s duality as decay/rebirth—though futuristic elements could feel more integral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (collage as consecrated vow) and subdued symbolism effectively; ending lingers ambiguously but avoids explicit emotional resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but relies on atmospheric vagueness rather than subverting genres; prose balances lyrical and functional but occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, though the vow’s ambiguity and underexplored weaver concept suggest narrative scaffolding.</comment>
