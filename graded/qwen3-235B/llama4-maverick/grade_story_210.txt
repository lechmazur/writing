<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lacks substantial character development; traits are stated but not demonstrated through meaningful actions or conflict. Motivation remains abstract rather than concrete.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot meanders without clear cause-effect; the connection between beginning and end is underdeveloped despite atmospheric buildup. Pacing creates drift rather than momentum.</comment>
