<question>1</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Underdeveloped character with inconsistent motivation; smuggling ties only superficially to tea-leaf quest, failing to establish authentic emotional stakes or psychological coherence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Elements feel like disjointed checklist fulfillment; narrative lacks unifying vision or emotional authenticity to justify its eclectic components.</comment>
