<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative presents a conflicted protagonist through poetic abstraction but lacks concrete motivations and definable character traits beneath the veneer of metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fragmented progression between atmospheric beats and revelations lacks tension; the "method" feels more like ritual than coherent action, diluting narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Unconventional setting details create rich sonic and textural contrasts, though the harmonization of cobblestones with a resonance chamber remains conceptually jarring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphor use (mosaic, resonance) elevates themes of fractured identity, but emotional beats rely on poetic vagueness rather than earned dramatic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Originality surfaces in sonic exploration, but excessive abstract phrasing ("savage serenity") and repetitive rhythm descriptions border on algorithmic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through patterned repetition rather than structural inevitability; the piece functions more as mood poem than traditional narrative with thematic resolution.</comment>
