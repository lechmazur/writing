<question>1</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Character remains largely symbolic, motivations are stated but not deeply explored. Actions lack concrete connection to restlessness or deception traits. No distinct voice or emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Loose chronology of transformation but lacks clear progression of cause-effect. Time markers ("days to weeks") exist yet feel artificial. Pacing languid but lacks narrative momentum or resolution of tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong atmospheric details (glow of lantern, Martian sounds) create immersive sensory experience. Tone of desolation contrasted with fragile hope enhances setting. Biodome setting meaningfully connected to fabric-as-life metaphor. "Bookshop mysteries" underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Some effective metaphors (thread as fragile salvation) and lyrical imagery, but emotional impact diluted by abstraction. Ending attempts thematic closure yet feels overly tidy. Theme present but shallowly explored. Prose occasionally borders on poetic pretension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Predictable tropes (hope in desolation) with insufficient subversion. Repetitive use of "reverberate" and "shadowy figures" feels formulaic. Over-reliance on dramatic yet vague statements rather than nuanced character interiority. Lacks striking originality despite stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements physically present but unevenly integrated - biodome established strongly, bookshop mysteries awkwardly tacked on. Length feels restrictive rather than purposeful. Conceptual coherence exists but lacks memorable emotional resonance or provocative implications.</comment>
