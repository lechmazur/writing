<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear progression lacks meaningful conflict/resolution; coherence maintained but feels incomplete due to underdeveloped plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Richly atmospheric with vivid sensory details, though setting occasionally overwhelms narrative purpose.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by melodramatic phrasing and imprecise descriptors like "softness of night"; atmospheric without emotional anchoring.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist rather than coalesce; poetic cohesion masks underdeveloped narrative and thematic execution.</comment>
