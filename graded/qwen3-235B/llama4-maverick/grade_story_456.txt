<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Faintly indicated motivations buried in abstract language; traits described rather than demonstrated through concrete actions; character psychology remains opaque despite introspective narration</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot exists in static contemplation without tangible progression; beginning and end mirror each other too closely; cosmic concept remains abstract ornamentation rather than narrative driver</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Permeated by self-consciously poetic phrasing that substitutes abstraction for insight; repetitive descriptors ("tempered," "delicate") and cosmic platitudes feel algorithmically generated</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Elements conspicuously arranged rather than organically integrated; formal experimentation masks lack of narrative substance beneath atmospheric flourishes</comment>
