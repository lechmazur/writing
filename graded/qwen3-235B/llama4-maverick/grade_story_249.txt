<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character exists as scattered quirky traits without emotional depth; "lazily ambitious" lacks psychological complexity. Vigilante's restoration of games feels like plot function over organic motivation. Voice remains indistinct despite narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vague cause-effect in trap methodology; action hinges on unshown quartet interactions. Repetitive structural loops about rain/fountains undermine narrative progression. Cyclic closing leaves arc incomplete within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Forgotten fountains establish visual motif but setting remains superficial—no tactile sensations like smell of rusted metal or sound of echoing drills. Timeframe device feels decorative rather than integral to plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Slight emotional resonance from "games as heritage" theme undercut by lack of character embodiment. Overreliance on adjectives like "whimsical" tells rather than showing human connection. Ending lacks thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids major AI markers but relies on trope of nostalgic urban decay. Some generic descriptors ("lingered", "whispers") and underexplored metaphors. Unique combinations (dentist drill as archival tool) show ingenuity without sufficient dramatic payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stack of elements feels like surreal checklist fulfillment rather than organic storytelling. Brevity works against cohesion—too many ideas (resilience, nostalgia, obsession) compete for attention without synthesis.</comment>
