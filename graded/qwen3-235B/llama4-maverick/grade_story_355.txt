<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation to action; aloofness as passive detachment rather than active resistance; harsh compassion lacks behavioral consequences; compass interaction doesn't sufficiently reveal internal conflict; poetic gestures substitute for meaningful character psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot hinges on vague metaphysical transformation; cause-effect between compass behavior and emotional release tenuous; circular structure exists but lacks narrative momentum; "mapping dreams" remains abstract concept without concrete procedural stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Visually immersive but psychologically shallow setting; surreal details overwhelm functional purpose; installation's detritus lacks symbolic specificity; time constraint evoked through deflated balloon motif but atmospheric transitions feel artificial.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical scaffolding (broken compass as fractured self-direction); emotionally resonant imagery but undercut by excessive lyrical abstraction; ending provides closure through symbolic equilibrium rather than dramatic epiphany.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uses "lost artist" tropes without subversion; sensory details occasionally verge into preciousness; psychological progression follows predictable arc; metaphors remain within expected emotional register without destabilizing surprises.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements function as symbolic placeholders rather than narrative drivers; ambitious thematic scope constrained by brevity; poetic language elevates but doesn't transcend assigned components; memorable for atmosphere over structural innovation.</comment>
