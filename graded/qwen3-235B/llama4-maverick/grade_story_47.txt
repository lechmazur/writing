<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary offers strong sensory contrasts but weak narrative integration; atmosphere of stillness vs. tension in voice notes remains underexplored; timelessness of setting disconnects from urgency of action; lack of worldbuilding beyond poetic descriptors</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Metaphors around silence vs. legacy resonate intellectually but lack visceral impact; central theme of reframing familiarity is clear but superficial; ending creates conceptual closure without emotional resonance; subtext about legacy vs. mortality hinted at but not fully embodied</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overreliance on abstract paradoxes ("graceless beauty") veers toward purple prose; symbolism feels secondhand rather than freshly imagined; narrative logic gaps suggest formulaic connections between elements; emotional notes are implied rather than enacted</comment>
