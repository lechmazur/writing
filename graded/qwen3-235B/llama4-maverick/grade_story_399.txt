<question>1</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Character’s grumpiness is superficial; trauma motivation stated, not demonstrated. Internal conflict lacks emotional nuance. Actions (jiggling tube) don’t deeply connect to psyche exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot follows cyclical structure but resolution feels abrupt. Key actions drive symbolism, yet character arc lacks pacing and causal clarity within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere built through mystical clichés (witch’s brew, silvery glow), but sensory details are abstract. Setting doesn’t deepen thematic resonance or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Heavy-handed symbolism (mandala as trauma) overshadows subtext. Ending feels declarative, not earned. Theme of healing is stated rather than organically shown through craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Relies on overused metaphors (“celestial ballet”) and generic introspection. Writing veers into purple prose; lacks human nuance in emotional beats and overly formal diction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Elements (cardboard tube, sand mandala) feel imposed on plot rather than integral. Ambitious themes undermine cohesion; short length exposes underdevelopment, not deliberate constraint.</comment>
