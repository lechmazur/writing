<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Stoicism is asserted but not deeply embodied in actions; motivations (archiving rituals, guilt) remain abstract without emotional texture. Minimal character change or nuance weakens development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Structure hinges on cryptic exchanges and symbolic acts rather than a traditional arc; momentum is maintained through poetic cadence, but lacks mechanical clarity in plot progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory textures (chalk dust, opal-eyed cat) create eerie cohesion, though the abstract setting occasionally overwhelms narrative grounding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visually arresting metaphors ("nightmares pooling into a mirror," "guilt woven into lullabies") elevate the narrative; themes of memory and complicity resonate through subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but risks ornate abstraction; some phrases verge on self-indulgent ("brash tenderness"), while the core premise of lies-as-architecture feels conceptually sharp.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Strong thematic cohesion despite brevity, but uneven character logic and sparse emotional stakes limit its broader impact as a standalone masterpiece.</comment>
