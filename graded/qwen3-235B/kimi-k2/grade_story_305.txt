<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s reticence is mostly internalized, occasionally shown through sparse actions, but motivation to “dethrone complacency” feels abstract rather than rooted in visceral stakes or personal history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot unfolds with elegant cause-and-effect, but the compressed word limit occasionally forces underdeveloped beats (e.g., swift resolution of the echo-choir’s rebellion) that dilute tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory-rich setting (waterlogged music, lanterns as “nervous applause”) and eerie atmosphere amplify thematic tension between silence and expression, history and erasure.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (“chorus of absences”) and subtext (artistic resistance, censorship) resonate sharply; ending balances closure and lingering defiance, though emotional resonance lacks raw human complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality in combining drowned musicians/echoes with bureaucratic complacency; avoids genre tropes. Prose occasionally veers into ornate phrasing (“candles tasting batter” feels conceptually strained).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements harmonize without redundancy; brevity feels intentional, using poetic compression to amplify thematic weight and haunting finality.</comment>
