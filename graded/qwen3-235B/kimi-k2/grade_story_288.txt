<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters function symbolically; blacksmith's motivations are implied but not fully explored, child's actions reveal defiance but lack depth. Relationships are hinted rather than developed, making motivations feel partially implied rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Linear progression but underdeveloped causal links; flag-into-paddle transformation drives plot yet integration with child's arc feels abrupt. Momentum builds to thematic resolution but lacks tension and stakes within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Apocalyptic tone is evocative via metallic air, rusted gates, TV-static sky. However, setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active force shaping character or theme, missing opportunities for deeper integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic symbolism (flag→wings, paddle→hope) elevates impact. Central conflict (creation vs. decay) resonates emotionally. Ending ties theme to motion/rhythm rather than permanence, though subtlety risks overshadowing narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through metaphorical language. Sensory details avoid genericism but occasional phrase ("audacious meekness") feels curated. Original in combining postwar setting with generational hope through art.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly integrated narratively. Style serves atmosphere but occasionally obscures character interiority. Brevity feels intentional yet leaves arcs underexplored, lingering via metaphor rather than emotional payoff.</comment>
