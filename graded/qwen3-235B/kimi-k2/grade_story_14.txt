<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's naivety drives actions but lacks deeper psychological complexity; motivations are poetic yet inconsistently tethered to concrete traits or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot moves through surrealism but gains coherence in the cyclical ending; pacing fits the tight word count, though the arc relies heavily on symbolic gestures over structural inevitability.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pervasive atmosphere of decay and defiance is masterfully rendered through tactile details (seaweed, tinned sardines) and the haunting blend of machinery and myth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors and symbolic resonance (e.g., smoke as language, spark as regenerative hope) elevate the narrative; ending achieves emotional and thematic payoff without sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified meditation on memory and impermanence; the concise structure feels intentional, each component shaping the story’s haunting, lingering resonance.</comment>
