<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character motivation (preserving folk medicine, escaping fame) is clear and consistent with secretive pathfinder identity; teapot ties to heritage and profession, but emotional depth occasionally feels abstract despite visceral actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot uses marathon training to mirror internal conflict, with the tunnel and boy catalyzing resolution; tight circularity from running to running toward, though rushed setup slightly strains believability within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Ghost train setting merges decay and magic; sensory details (flickering lights, willow bark tea, creaking sounds) create immersive, symbolic atmosphere that mirrors protagonist’s duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Steganographic playlists, teapot-as-medicine, and constellations-as-plant-annotations layer meaning; lyrical prose avoids cliché, ending resonates thematically; emotional beats show rather than state.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unconventional methods (hidden playlist data) and metaphysical setting; tone balances poetic and grounded, though "aloof passion" borders on vague; no purple prose, relies on specific, haunting imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements (teapot, haunted park, playlists) are integral to both plot and theme; length allows focused, metaphor-rich narrative; ending delivers thematic catharsis without sentimentality.</comment>
