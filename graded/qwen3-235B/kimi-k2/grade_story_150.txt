<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Calder’s motivation of conflicting desires drives his actions, but the outlaw aspect lacks depth beyond the label. His voice is distinct but feels underexploited. Interactions with the dice and shifting walls hint at deeper character threads left underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from arrival to transformation, driven by Calder’s decisions. Pacing is occasionally fragmented, but the connection between the domino-effect of his choices and the final sacrifice is coherent. Tight constraints limit deeper development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (brass grating, hissing valves, metallic coffee) immerse readers in the steampunk-dome’s atmosphere. The setting’s mechanical-mystical duality enhances the tone, though its full history feels implied rather than fleshed out.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (dice as destiny, shifting text as prophecy) are effective. The ending’s emotional resonance is undercut by explicit statements of emotion (“saturated ambivalence”) rather than subtler subtext. Themes of legacy and sacrifice are clear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Blends steampunk and mythic tropes in novel ways (dice manipulating cosmic text). Avoids clichés with surreal juxtapositions, though occasional phrases (“saturated ambivalence”) verge on overused abstractions. Style generally avoids generic descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere into a cohesive whole, though the outlaw identity feels superfluous. The story’s ambition in blending cosmic scale with intimate stakes is striking, but pacing and underdeveloped motivations constrain its impact.</comment>
