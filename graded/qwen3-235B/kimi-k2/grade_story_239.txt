<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are cryptic rather than compelling; emotional stakes remain abstract despite vivid imagery. Frenetic illusionist label doesn't fully manifest in behavior or decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot pivots on poetic moments over logical cause/effect; power outage connection feels magical rather than earned, but circular time-travel structure works within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Rich visuals lack thematic integration; tone of "secretive defiance" is diluted by atmospheric inconsistency (gothic elements clash with scientific reading room).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric layering (tree rings as narrative cycles) and resonant symbols (imperfect A.R. ring), but emotional beats often hinted rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Original time-theft mechanics through dendrochronology; avoids most clich√©s but stumbles with occasionally overwritten metaphors ("exhaled scholars into midnight street").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overreliance on poetic shorthand strains coherence; elements like Council of Archivists feel underexplored despite clever core concept of self-authored history.</comment>
