<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's absent-mindedness and emotional weight of failure are poignant but underdeveloped; motivations hinted at through tactile memories and dialogue fragments never fully crystallize into human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear trajectory from archive entry to transcendence has mythic elegance, but the condensed arc sacrifices causality coherence; pivotal decision to board feels under-motivated despite lyrical momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory alchemy of synthetic vs natural sounds creates vertiginous atmosphere; AI-infused environment reflects internal states through precise metaphoric details like violet-to-rose gradient mirroring emotional tonal shifts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mastery of symbolic resonance—fermentation as emotional preservation, stamped relics becoming conduits of rebirth—elevates concept; subtext about obsolete humans finding purpose in AI systems lingers provocatively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some phrases (kinesthized memory, mist-filled railcar) inventively tactile; others (bitter yet sweet obsolescence) flirt with overwritten abstraction; occasional poetic density strains suspension of disbelief.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Exquisite micro-craft in specific images (cedar bough loops, trembling hands mirroring thermometers) creates cohesive thematic tapestry; conceptual ambition occasionally outpaces character depth required for total transcendence.</comment>
