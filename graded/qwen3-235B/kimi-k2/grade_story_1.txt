<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's phobia and stunt-double traits drive the plot but lack psychological complexity; motivations feel implied rather than deeply felt. The transition from fear to triumph lacks earned emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression through knot-unraveling, but the abrupt shifts between memories and environment feel disjointed. The time constraints weaken the cause-effect logic within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rich, visceral descriptions anchor the surreal setting (e.g., "barnacled light"), but the pyramid-library/garage-sale juxtaposition leans on contrast rather than cohesion. Sensory overload occasionally obscures emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegant metaphors ("net as map of fears") and the theme of fear commodified resonate. The ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic action rather than exposition. Requires closer attention to pacing nuances.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some florid phrasing ("metronome of dread") undermines otherwise striking imagery. While subversive in blending mysticism with mundanity, the story occasionally relies on associative leaps over organic emotional logic. Predictable structure (trauma → healing) tempers originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (fears ↔ knots, spirituality ↔ commerce), creating a hauntingly paradoxical whole. The brevity serves as a strength, distilling existential stakes into visceral, tactile moments. Could benefit from tighter emotional throughlines.</comment>
