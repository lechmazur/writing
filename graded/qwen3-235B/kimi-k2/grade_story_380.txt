<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are poetically conveyed but lack psychological complexity. While the fragmented self and dream theft concept are intriguing, the protagonist feels more like a metaphor than a fully embodied figure with human contradictions beyond "quiet mania." Motivational logic connecting dream-theft to baseball fixation remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Non-linear structure prioritizes lyrical imagery over plot propulsion. The plunge resolves the emotional stakes but narrative momentum between album contemplation and descent lacks narrative urgency. The batting-order metaphor provides structural cleverness but sacrifices dramatic tension between decisions and consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elegiac beauty in descriptions of the treehouse's haunted grandeur and post-human melancholy. Sensory details like pine resin breath and crackling photo sleeves create immersive decay. However, the forest floor as "catcher's mitt" risks preciousness undercutting atmospheric gravity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stunning metaphors ("dissolution to emptiness," "cheer existing only in confiscated dreams") and conceptual brilliance elevate the narrative. The final vision of becoming whole through sacrifice resonates thematically. Some emotional beats (missing tooth memory) feel overly schematic rather than organically affecting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending baseball's numeric legacy with dream-theft symbolism impresses. Avoids direct AI tells while maintaining evocative surrealism, though the "scoreboard wiped clean" and moth/mania comparisons border on conventional poetic devices. Emotional landscapes occasionally drift toward stated over shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>While conceptually rich and stylistically striking, the narrative relies too heavily on poetic abstraction at the expense of narrative specificity. The central act of plunging requires deeper psychological grounding to fully transcend metaphorical trappings despite undeniable emotional resonance in the final image.</comment>
