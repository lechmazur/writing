<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Telepathy is integral to Liora's eavesdropping motivation, but character psychology lacks interiority—motives remain atmospheric rather than psychological. Personality expressed primarily through symbols rather than nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Glacial metaphor structures narrative progression; button hook discovery drives action efficiently despite limited word count. Resolution feels abrupt—glacier's emotional impact on mechanics underdeveloped within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Dock's oily decay contrasts elegantly with icy purity; synesthetic details (cardamom/motor oil) create vivid cognitive dissonance. Seasonal liminality mirrors thematic tension between speed and slowness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Subtle symbolism (steam as questions, frost as legacy) creates multi-layered meaning. Ending's thematic declaration risks didacticism but is salvaged by poetic construction and glacier-as-legacy metaphor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages verge on purple prose ("slow drip of meaning"), but atmospheric consistency and original metaphors (telepathy as "static") elevate craftsmanship beyond expected AI markers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite cohesion between elements creates resonant whole; each object (button hook, journals) serves dual purposes without feeling contrived. Leaves haunting meditation on impermanence vs. legacy.</comment>
