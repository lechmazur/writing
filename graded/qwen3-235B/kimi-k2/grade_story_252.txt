<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation for redemption is clear but emotionally underdeveloped; actions align with penitence but lack psychological depth in transformation. Face-in-the-block's accusatory nature hints at complexity but remains superficial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses through petal-tracking, but transitions between vault chambers feel rushed. Connection between swing set opening and sealing crack resolution is conceptually elegant but emotionally inert. Cause-effect logic requires suspension of disbelief about memory mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting achieves haunting cohesiveness through sensory details like frozen orchard ghosts and strawberry-regret scent. Icy warmth juxtaposition creates palpable tension. Swing set's final stasis effectively bookends atmospheric decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (petals as breadcrumbs, memories as fruit) resonate powerfully. Style balances poetic precision with clarity. Recalibration as metaphor for moral repair works well, though conclusion feels thematically overstated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Largely avoids clich√©s through memory-as-fruit economy. Some floral descriptions verge on excessive, but emotional resonance emerges through tactile block memories. Conceptual scaffolding occasionally outweighs organic character thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock with near-symmetrical precision: thief's crimes enable restoration, block embodies stolen joy, petal trails literalize memory pathways. Conclusion's thematic closure risks neatness but earns emotional weight through sensory specificity.</comment>
