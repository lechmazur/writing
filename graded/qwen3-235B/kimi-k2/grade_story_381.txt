<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>While the necromancer's motivation to preserve analog theaters and cinema history is clear, her role as a "hushed" character remains underdeveloped. Her necromantic abilities are described but not deeply explored beyond their utility for data collection, missing opportunities to connect her supernatural methods to emotional or ethical complexities. The baseball cap as a vessel for her grandfather's essence adds pathos but feels underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The loop-like structure of "between sets" creates a static rhythm that undermines forward momentum in a short format. The reveal of the crystal theater feels abrupt, with insufficient buildup of stakes or tension around accessing the cave's "final secret." The plot's circular references to data collection routines contrast with the emotional climax in a way that weakens pacing cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystalline cave's interplay of refracted light and cinematic memory projections creates vivid, resonant imagery that perfectly conveys the theme of imperishable art. Sensory contrasts between the cave's organic hum and sterile digital world are sharp, but the "sound of resolve" as a motif lacks physicality beyond metaphor (e.g., more tactile details about the vibrations in her bones or crystal resonance in her teeth would deepen immersion).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concept of necromancy-as-preservation offers a fresh reinvention of supernatural tropes, while the crystal projections function as powerful metaphors for contested memory. The closing image of the baseball cap as a beacon lingers viscerally. However, the story occasionally states its themes (e.g., "soul vs. efficiency") rather than letting them emerge organically through subtext, weakening emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While the fusion of sci-fi (neural links, drones) and fantasy (necromancy) feels intentional, the repetitive "between sets" refrains verge on AI-generated cadence. The grandfather's laughter as a disembodied echo is conceptually strong but sits awkwardly beside the clinical language of mineral harvesting. Some sensory details (glowing cap, mineral script) provide specificity without over-explaining, but the "sound of resolve" remains frustratingly abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story's strongest asset is its paradoxical tone—simultaneously wistful and forward-looking—yet its brevity works both for and against it. The synthesis of film preservation with geological memory is ingenious, but the closing image of a singing cave projecting films lacks the emotional payoff it deserves. The premise supports deeper exploration of time-layering, which gets truncated by the word limit.</comment>
