<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marshal Vale's duality between duty and rebellion is clear, but her internal logic remains underexplored; interactions with Lys lack psychological complexity despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot arcs from mission to subversion with minimal friction; the manuscript retrieval is streamlined but cohesive. Some festival pacing feels perfunctory.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Rich, synesthetic detail (whisper-orchids, liquid starlight) and ethereal tone merge to create a vivid, original setting that shapes both conflict and resolution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. freedom are elegantly rendered through symbolic action (not photographing originals). Subtext about knowledge as living rather than hoarded adds depth.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("contraband...melody," "paper prayers") offset occasional overwriting ("consciously rebellious"). Avoids clich√©s but risks preciousness through density of imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Every element (even the microsecond timeframe) feels purpose-built; tension between institutional control and organic connection lingers like implied subtext in the wind-carried fortunes.</comment>
