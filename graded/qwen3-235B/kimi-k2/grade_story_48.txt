<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Character motivation (archive sacred knowledge) is consistent and shapes her methodical actions. The desert wanderer's actions align with her purpose, but she remains more archetypal than psychologically complex despite symbolic depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical arc (fallen apple to replanted seeds) with clear progression. Assignments (research through everyday miracles) drive the narrative, but some transitions (e.g., sudden solar flare revelation) lean on poetic convenience over strict causality.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich interplay of sensory details (brass ruler's "memory of rain," cinnamon in recycled air) creates a cohesive atmosphere. "Authentically artificial" elements enhance both setting and theme, though the derelict station stretches plausibility slightly.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyrical and thematically layered, with subtext about archiving emotion in a desensitizing galaxy. The ending resonates metaphorically, though "translated love as migration" leans heavily on abstract abstraction over concrete emotional immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids mechanical phrasing; metaphors/similes (tears becoming frequencies, love as a constellation) feel original. Emotional resonance emerges through symbolic actions (storing seeds) rather than exposition. Tone remains consistent despite ambitious scope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements combine into a cohesive whole: ruler's physicality grounds the ethereal theme; the desert-space dynamic reinforces the tension between archiving and lived experience. Ending lingers conceptually without being overly cryptic.</comment>
