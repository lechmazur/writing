<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic but lacks depth; motivations are hinted through actions yet underdeveloped</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end arc exists but feels compressed; transitions between planting and transformation rely on poetic logic over narrative causality</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with rich synesthetic details (ash tasting of comet-fire, iron "blooming"), though some descriptors verge on overload</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (weathervane as "secret sentence") and symbolic action convey layered meaning about creation; lacks emotional punch from character perspective</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Some striking phrases ("theory rebellious ache") dazzle but occasional abstraction ("wilderness inside him") risks vagueness; mostly avoids clich√© but borders on self-parody at times</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elaborate structure succeeds despite technical constraints; elements integrate tightly save for comet's mechanical plot function; final image lingers beautifully</comment>
