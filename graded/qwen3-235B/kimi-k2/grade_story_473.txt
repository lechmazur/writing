<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's backstory and actions align with her eccentric cartographer origins and rebellion against imposed maps, but emotional depth feels slightly surface-level in conveying her transformation and lingering burden.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic arc from rebellion to reluctant mentorship exists, but tighter pacing and more explicit cause-effect between her club experiences and teaching approach would strengthen coherence within the constrained form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visually potent contrasts between solar-age tech and organic rebellion shine through sensory details like stored sunlight’s glow and bark-rough laughter. Atmospheric tension between control and growth feels fully realized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (grafts as rebellion, disclaimers as fate-resistance) and subtext about leadership-as-organic-process elevate impact. Ending resonates thematically without preachiness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cartographic precision with botanical rebellion avoids clichés. Subtle character psychology (e.g., burning the manual as both release and warning) shows nuanced craft. Just minor overreliance on "bittersweet grit" repetition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic unity: orchard, pruning, and disclaimers interlock seamlessly to question authority. Ending lingers through implication rather than explanation, rewarding reflection.</comment>
