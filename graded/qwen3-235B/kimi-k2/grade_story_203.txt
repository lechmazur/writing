<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's stage fright directly shapes action and motivation but remains minimally explored beyond ceremonial paralysis; motivation to rewrite inheritance is clear but lacks emotional nuance; voice emerges strongly when confronting the ghost but feels inconsistently applied throughout.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Key-driven method creates coherent plot progression; the arc from paralysis to agency resolves within constraints; pacing balances poetic imagery against narrative urgency but struggles with compression, leaving war backstory underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Orbital setting and "defiant hush" tone amplify thematic tension; vacuum's silence as both obstacle and metaphor works well; sensory details (solar drones, trembling petals) immerse but lack tactile specificity in critical moments.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subjugated voice as both literal and metaphorical weight creates powerful symbolism; ending's transformation of "never usual" into possibility resonates; dialogue absent but subtextual layers compensate; emotional impact slightly diluted by abstract narration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Genre tropes (haunted inheritance, exorcism) reframed through orbital decay feel original; some phrases ("words that keep war alive") edge toward conceptual overextension; emotional beats shown more than stated but occasionally veer into poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Surprising fusion of exorcism and space decay creates unique thematic resonance; integration of elements feels purposeful but strained in isolated instances; ending lingers conceptually but risks sentimentalism through metaphor accumulation.</comment>
