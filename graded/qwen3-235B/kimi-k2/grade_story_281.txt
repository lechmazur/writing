<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to transform from thief to keeper is clear, but his past as a pickpocket remains underexplored, weakening the emotional foundation of his arc despite poetic symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on abstract transformation via poetry, which feels both mystical and under-explained; pacing is ambitious but occasionally loses narrative clarity in its symbolic density.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rust, heat, and industrial decay create a visceral atmosphere; the engine room’s haunted quality and sensory details immerse the reader, though the "between appointments" timeframe feels detached from the setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Poetic language, metaphorical depth (e.g., "ships as verbs"), and thematic focus on rewriting identity elevate the storytelling; the lighthouse-as-throat conceit is striking and resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal metaphors (e.g., varnish-tears, origami gulls), but some phrasing veers toward ornate abstraction, occasionally sacrificing emotional nuance for poetic flourish.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blend of elements creates cohesion, but the story’s brevity leaves some aspects (like the dummy’s sentience) underjustified; the core theme of identity rebirth lingers effectively.</comment>
