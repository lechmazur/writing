<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks tangible motivation and consistent actions; internal conflict remains abstract rather than manifesting through specific behaviors. Voice and history are hinted at but insufficiently developed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative arc exists but relies heavily on poetic abstraction over plot momentum; cause-effect logic occasionally collapses under surreal metaphors without clear narrative function.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eerie, original atmosphere created through synesthetic imagery, but some symbolic elements (bean stalks as dying halos) overreach, diluting emotional resonance with excessive conceptual density.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Masterful symbolic crafting and thematic cohesion elevate this work, though the ending’s philosophical declaration feels more didactic than organically earned through character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Richly original imagery contrasts with occasional affectations (“jogging in place to avoid calcification”); maintains freshness while occasionally prioritizing poetic density over narrative clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements function as interconnected metaphors rather than arbitrary constraints; surrealism coalesces into coherent existential exploration despite occasional tonal inconsistencies.</comment>
