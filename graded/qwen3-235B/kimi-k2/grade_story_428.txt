<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Inconsistent emotional depth; motivation is present but lacks layered development. The character's actions align with his traits, but inner conflicts are stated rather than shown. Dialogue is absent, weakening voice establishment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight structure within constraints; the plot follows a clear arc. Pacing is uneven during the constellations' rearrangement, which feels abrupt. Cause/effect relationships are logical but under-explored. Ending resolves the central conflict effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Immersive atmosphere through specific sensory details (monsoon leaks, brass lion’s texture, pulsing red constellations). The setting’s historical weight deepens the theme. Temporal cues (Maratha wars lineage) add cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (constellations as shattered fate, blotter as liberation tool) and vivid metaphors elevate impact. Ending delivers thematic resonance about flexibility vs. rigidity. Subtext about control as self-destruction is nuanced and memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids major tropes but leans on occasional ornate phrasing (“sky of ink,” “jailer’s grin”). Emotional resonance is mostly shown through action, but descriptions sometimes lapse into abstraction. Unique metaphors prevail over clichés, but tonal shifts risk overwrought prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified theme, though some (broken constellations) feel more integral than others (hoarded supplies). Style amplifies content; the brevity serves as a deliberate constraint to mirror the protagonist’s minimalist resolution.</comment>
