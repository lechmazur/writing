<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "faithfully unfaithful" are stated but underexplored; emotional depth is implied through poetic abstraction rather than earned through action or conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot flows logically within the constraint, using each element to advance the central action, though the cosmic resolution feels abrupt and under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly evoked (museum shadows, silent orchard), but connections between setting elements (e.g., dinosaur bones, universe) remain conceptually thin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("universe in a sparrow's heart") and thematic subtlety elevate the narrative, though abstract resolution risks vagueness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with fresh imagery like the femur gnomon; occasional overwriting ("phosphorus ghosts") skirts excess without succumbing to it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Elements are woven cohesively into a resonant whole, though the theme of "late bloomers" and some tonal flourishes feel superimposed rather than organic.</comment>
