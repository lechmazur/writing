<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Character motivation relies on over-stylized melancholy without deeper psychological complexity; reactions to objects (label, pho) feel more symbolic than human, with inconsistent emotional texture between memory and present action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot structure collapses under its own metaphor—avalanche imagery dominates at the expense of narrative progression; beginning and end mirror rather than develop, rendering the middle inert despite lyrical flourishes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is potent but overwhelming—neon slums and synthetic pho create rich mood, though worldbuilding often substitutes for plot propulsion with diminishing returns past the initial paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Haunting metaphors (memory as avalanche, food as communion) elevate impact; inconsistent emotional authenticity undermines immersion—some phrases (e.g., "rambling destiny") verge on self-parody.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in framing grief as posthuman fragmentation; repetitive phrasing ("unfamiliar reflections," "collapsed memories") and overly polished aphorisms weaken emotional gravity with artifice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cohesion exists through tonal unity rather than structural intention; assigned elements function as set dressing more than narrative DNA, suggesting an exercise in aesthetics over meaning.</comment>
