<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Precision in characterization is undermined by prioritizing surreal metaphor over psychological depth; Marisol’s sass and defiance are vivid but lack emotional grounding to make her a relatable agent of chaos.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is cohesive but leans on episodic chest-opening sequences; pacing in the final act is rushed despite strong thematic resolution where the office’s collapse feels earned yet formulaic in its transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story’s crown jewel—sensory details like the “carpet turned to coarse sea salt” and “moon seasoned with paprika” create an immersive, surreal logic that elevates the setting into a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-impact prose with deliberate, provocative diction (“fluorescent geometry liquefying into a roux”), though abstract grandeur occasionally eclipses narrative clarity; the metaphor of madness-as-flavor resonates with haunting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</comment>comment>Prose dazzles with originality (culinary cosmology, salting a dean’s deterministic pastries) but stumbles into ornate phrasing (“lingering perfume of rebellion”) that occasionally feels performative rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of surrealism and structure; each element serves the central theme of controlled chaos, with the tight word limit leveraged as a strength rather than a constraint.</comment>
