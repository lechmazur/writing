<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila's characterization as a rebel is consistent but lacks deeper exploration of her motivations beyond surface-level rebellion; her actions occasionally feel more symbolic than psychologically grounded.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is atmospheric but occasionally meanders; cause and effect are clear, though some transitions (e.g., sudden focus on shared cuisine) feel underdeveloped within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail; atmosphere and setting deeply enhance plot and theme, though some elements (e.g., chililime memory) verge on over-ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Storytelling is rich in metaphor and subtext (e.g., adaptation, resurrection), though some emotional beats rely on stylized language over visceral authenticity; ending resonates conceptually but risks abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids major pitfalls of formulaic writing; some phrases (e.g., "cotton candy ghosts") flirt with cliché, but the integration of themes and imagery—particularly the knife's multifunctional symbolism—shows ingenuity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story excels in cohesion and thematic ambition; however, the concise format occasionally strains the narrative's emotional density, leaving some connections (e.g., Mateo's sudden inclusion) underexplored.</comment>
