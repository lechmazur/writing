<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through synesthetic worldbuilding, though some phrases risk ornamentation over meaning. Human irrationality implied through devotion rather than direct psychology. Consistently original if occasionally mannered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements function as poetic levers but emotional gravity comes from cumulative atmosphere rather than character investment. Technical precision serves thematic continuity while sacrificing some narrative immediacy.</comment>
