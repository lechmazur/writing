<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's regret and motivation are evocative but remain abstract; reactions to objects lack visceral emotional grounding to fully realize his internal frontier cartographer history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence and cyclical structure, but the abrupt transition into the shared memory sequence strains credibility; the arc is conceptually complete but strained by pacing pressures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marksman creation of a hauntingly tactile world—shipwrecks, greenhouse mist, coral growth—all elements work symbiotically to create an immersive, dreamlike atmosphere with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative use of metaphor (remorse as coral, fingerprints as portals) creates layered meaning; ending resonates thematically. Dialogue absence is a minor detractor from emotional depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate into a cohesive whole despite word count; the synthesis of guilt, memory, and connection achieves emotional resonance while maintaining formal precision.</comment>
