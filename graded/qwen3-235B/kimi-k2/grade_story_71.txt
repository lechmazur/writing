<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character traits remain static; emotional detachment undercuts development. Motivation through oath feels imposed rather than intrinsic to Patchwork's being. Interactions with objects reveal symbolic meaning but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ambitious structure collapses under word limit. Nonlinear progression between VR sequences and present action disrupts momentum. Resolution feels abrupt despite thematic symmetry. Cause-effect logic weakened by compressed storytelling.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually and sensorially arresting: ash storms, blood-smelling dust, glowing tears crystallized as geography. Atmosphere transcends surrealism through consistent tactile detail. Settings (ribcage as cathedral, parallel realities) build immersive thematic framework.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (veins-as-fate, fan-as-shield) strike viscerally. The twist unites story and theme effectively. Emotional impact diluted by overly abstract plotting; self-creation revelation feels under-resonated in limited space.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elevates fantastical premise through inventive object use but suffers from overwritten phrasing ("storm of ash," "fervent apathy"). Tropes (chosen protector, cosmic sacrifice) updated through surreal lens. Nuanced emotion absent despite lyrical description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Story feels overstuffed yet conceptually provocative. Elements interlock but strain against brevity. Style occasionally sabotages clarity with overdetermined imagery. Lingering question about emotion-as-weakness theme resonates faintly.</comment>
