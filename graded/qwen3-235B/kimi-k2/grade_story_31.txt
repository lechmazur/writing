<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (escape from being overlooked through nurturing) is clear but internal conflict remains under-explored; actions align with backstory but lack nuanced psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Structure follows a complete arc within constraints; drone delivery drives plot momentum. Key's journey creates satisfactory closure, though some temporal shifts feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with neon-veined fruit and smog visuals, but cyberpunk elements occasionally overwhelm emotional grounding. Sensory details inconsistent between lush and sparse passages.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subtext of grafting as metaphor for connection is masterful. Ending resonates with emotional logic, though dialogue absence risks relying on excessive thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in merging horticulture with cyberpunk; avoids clich√©s by making "interconnectedness" literal. Some phrasing ("capillaries remembering blood") borders on overwritten while maintaining stylistic discipline.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Element cohesion is high but execution occasionally prioritizes concept over emotional authenticity. Length works for vignette but sacrifices secondary character development.</comment>
