<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength: Kael's guilt and redemption arc are compelling, but motivations border on melodramatic. Voss's agency remains underexplored despite her haunting line about being "saved into a cage."</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strength: The constrained plot achieves closure within the word limit. Weakness: Overreliance on exposition ("rebellion topside had turned") feels rushed rather than seamlessly integrated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strength: Submerged city with algae-as-mourning lace and torpedo strikes create immersive decay. Weakness: Connection between social upheaval above and underwater setting could be more symbiotic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength: Language achieves poetic resonance ("neural stars," "spiderweb cracks"). Weakness: Emotional revelations feel somewhat telegraphed rather than earned through layered subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strength: Evocative metaphors avoid clich√©s. Weakness: Some phrases ("heart loud," "blaze endure") risk becoming archaic affectations rather than organic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Synthesis of memory, guilt, and preservation of knowledge lingers. Weakness: The "flame endure" theme occasionally overstates its purpose.</comment>
