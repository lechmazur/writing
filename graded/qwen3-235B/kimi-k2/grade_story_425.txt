<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the paladin’s transformation feels abrupt despite consistent internal logic, and sparse dialogue limits emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot structure is poetic but strained—stitching the universe as a method works, but the sudden resolution and narrative jumps within dense imagery create a sense of incompleteness.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly detailed with sensory specifics (e.g., dulled brass, stardust), but the "lavishly austere" setting occasionally overrides practical implications of a post-star-naming world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors, thematic resonance, and the symbolic interplay of light/darkness create lasting impact; the ending’s subtext elevates the narrative beyond technical flaws.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors (e.g., "oath rewritten in light") and the fusion of cosmic and intimate elements feel inventive; avoids genre clichés despite occasional lyrical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion elevates the story; the brevity serves the mythic tone, though pacing unevenness and abstract concepts occasionally dilute emotional immediacy.</comment>
