<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (guilt over abandoning sister) is clear but under-explored; reliance on metaphor over concrete emotional beats leaves psychological complexity implied rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists through symbolic actions, but the sequence between memory triggers and resolution feels slightly abstracted; pacing drags in middle sections despite compact structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, layered atmosphere created through prismatic visuals, construction sounds, and tactile objects; slightly overwrought descriptions risk diluting emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Poetic language and recurring motifs create strong emotional resonance; the central metaphor of the lake as a mirror achieves thematic resonance, though some symbols verge on over-explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors ("colors folded over it like forgiving wings") and textured self-destructive longing feel human; occasional ornate phrasing ("hammering and distant seesaw's cry") borders on indulgent.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Story succeeds as self-contained emotional journey but leans heavily on lyrical scaffolding; the concise arc and thematic cohesion outweigh minor structural looseness in mid-section.</comment>
