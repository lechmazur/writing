<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's grief is well-etched through symbolic objects and setting but lacks psychological complexity; motivations are implied but under-explored, with archetypal dialogue reducing emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemptive arc with thematic coherence but strains under compressed pacing; cause-effect between actions and emotional shifts are poetically rendered but structurally imprecise.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is a vivid, haunting character—radio wave garden and water tower create a unique atmosphere that mirrors internal turmoil, though some sensory details verge on overdone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radiant with metaphor (mapping grief, echoes as truth), the story's lyrical prose and layered subtext elevate its emotional resonance, though occasionally risks obscurity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceits (radio gardens, fractured reflections) but falters in moments of overwrought description; avoids clichés through imaginative symbolism but occasionally lapses into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Despite dense imagery, the story achieves cohesion and thematic resonance; some elements feel decorative rather than essential, but the central metaphor of mapping grief offers lasting impact.</comment>
