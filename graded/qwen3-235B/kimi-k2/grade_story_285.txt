<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Awkwardness and swordsman identity underexplored; motivation to restore traditions is clear but internal conflict thin despite symbolic resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive arc from postcard receipt to symbolic act; pacing tight but some cause-effect steps feel condensed (e.g., archive filing's personal impact).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Geothermal vents and ice-apple trees create vivid, thematically relevant tension; sensory details like steam's "rancor" and shell-carved symbols elevate atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Potent metaphor of migration over preservation; sword-to-shell symbolism resonates; ending avoids trite resolution by embracing impermanence through lived-in imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original in concept but risks overwrought description ("whispering ghosts of memory" might edge toward purple prose); some stock phrases ("weight of tradition") undermine uniqueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements woven into thematic scaffold rather than tacked on; brevity amplifies emotional resonance but risks underdeveloped emotional peaks.</comment>
