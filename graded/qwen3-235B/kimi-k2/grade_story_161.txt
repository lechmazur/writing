<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Precise, symbolic gestures (e.g., letter seal, peacock pattern log) effectively externalize grief/obsession, but interiority and emotional nuance remain too compressed. Motivation clear yet underdeveloped in humanizing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rigorous cause-effect chain (crash → mural surveillance → sabotage) drives the plot, but the tight word limit leaves some stakes underexplained (e.g., board’s mechanics). Pacing balances intrigue with revelation effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Liminal space between agrarian ritual and sterile tech works conceptually, but sensory details (tart cider, rustling blueprints) only partially compensate for vague institutional bureaucracy portrayal. Atmospheric cohesion strong but thin on lived-in textures.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (mural as evidence, pruning as sabotage) deepen thematic resonance. Ending’s livestream as “receipts” is clever, but emotional impact diluted by stylized prose occasionally prioritizing aesthetics over authentic pathos.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional fusion of eccentric premise and precise detail resists tropes. Language avoids “purple prose” via controlled metaphor density. Subversion of expectations (gardener as hacker) and mechanical/spiritual contrasts feel authentically human in their paradox.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Interlocking elements create narrative efficiency. Occasional abstraction (e.g., “fiberoptic cable matching mural”) strains plausibility slightly, but the closing shift from penance to hopeful agency provides thematic closure within brevity constraints.</comment>
