<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched through multiversal duality, but lacks psychological depth beyond the 'overconfident rebel' archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tight structure collapses time-sensitive tension into a single decisive moment, though the vault's resolution feels prematurely neat for such a cosmic conflict.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory specifics (humming floors, magnetic tides) but setting remains a visual-only stage rather than a lived-in reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mastery of metaphor (spinning top as fate's axis) and thematic subtext shines, though emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with 'neither hero nor villain' resolution, but certain phrases ('storm braid', 'magnetic tide') verge on overdetermined symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>High-concept elements cohere thematically but strain narrative plausibility; the observatory's core and multiversal mechanics remain underinterrogated worldbuilding.</comment>
