<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (rewriting destiny to avoid emotional pain) is coherent, but secondary characters lack depth. Mira's "proudly humble" trait is present but inconsistently manifested through dialogue/actions, which remain minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc, but the resolution feels abrupt; Jax's transformation lacks sufficient buildup. The dice-reading drives the narrative effectively, yet cause-effect chains (e.g., how the dice directly alter reality) remain underexplained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid details like "rust and jasmine" create atmosphere, but the hybrid genre (space opera/grimdark fairytale) mingles uneasily. Sensory coherence is uneven; some descriptions (e.g., "chipped three kissed the perfect seven") border on pretention.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "dice finding their balance" work well, and the theme of rewriting destiny resonates. However, emotional beats (Jax's tears) rely heavily on explicit statements rather than subtler narrative cues.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concepts (e.g., psychic genealogist, bullet train diaries) subvert sci-fi tropes but include overused phrases ("alarm bells of heartbreak," "metallic ghosts"). The "abandoned bullet train" device feels contrived despite its thematic purpose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but strain plausibility (e.g., starlight-stitched threads altering timelines). The brevity works for poetic impact but sacrifices narrative depth, leaving character dynamics underexplored.</comment>
