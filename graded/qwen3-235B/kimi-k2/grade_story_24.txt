<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character remains enigmatic; motivation implied but underdeveloped beyond symbolic gestures. Actions align with assigned traits but lack personal stakes or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically but ends abruptly, sacrificing closure. Assigned action/method conceptually drive the narrative, but structural momentum falters slightly in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is evocative but inconsistently integrated (bookstore/mountain linkage feels incidental). Sensory details enrich atmosphere, but timeframeâ€™s relevance remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with poetic urgency; subversive puppetry as metaphor achieves emotional resonance. Metaphors, pacing, and subtext elevate storytelling to exceptional craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending magical realism with intimate pathos. Avoids tropes but occasionally succumbs to stylistic excess, skirting purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</question><comment>Elaborate style sometimes overwhelms cohesion. Assigned elements are mostly well-woven, but some (bookstore, timeframe) lack narrative necessity, diminishing overall unity.</comment>
