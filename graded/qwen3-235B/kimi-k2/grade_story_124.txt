<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character's motivations surface through symbolic gestures, but lacks overt emotional depth; actions hint at trauma and longing, yet internal logic remains elliptical rather than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progresses through tactile, metaphorical actions, but narrative arc relies heavily on poetic abstraction; cohesion exists but pacing feels intentionally meandering rather than purposefully driven.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dichotomy of lunar colony and rustic elements creates vivid, haunting atmosphere; sensory details (scent of rosin, creaking loom) ground surrealism in tangible immediacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional craftsmanship in metaphor (grace as thread-weaving, gravity as emotional burden); lyrical prose elevates thematic resonance, though abstract closure may polarize.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of sci-fi and pastoral motifs avoids formula; metaphors are fresh but occasionally veer into preciousness ("shimmering cloth pale as regolith"); emotional nuance triumphs over explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements harmonize to serve a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances poetic impact, though some connections (e.g., "gentler" colony atmosphere) lean on poetic license rather than narrative inevitability.</comment>
