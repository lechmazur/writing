<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation ties to cosmic feud but lacks emotional depth; minstrel's voice is poetic yet feels more archetypal than psychologically real.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional arc but builds cohesive cosmic-game metaphor; pacing slows during cloud-pattern exposition but ends with resonant thematic closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through visceral details like "steam as question marks" and genetically engineered horses; blends steampunk and surrealism but occasionally overloads with imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (cosmic chess, stamp as dialogue) create haunting subtext; ending achieves lyrical transcendence while exploring duality of closure/questioning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in celestial-horse stable fusion, but some phrases ("liquid eyes") risk ornate detachment; emotional logic feels consciously constructed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements synergize thematically despite condensed form; ending's circularity and "mundane enchantment" linger as profound yet accessible.</comment>
