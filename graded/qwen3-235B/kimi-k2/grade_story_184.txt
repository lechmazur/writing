<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ludo's sarcasm and rebelliousness define him but lack emotional depth; motivation to mock his calling is consistent yet superficial. Internal conflict is poetic but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure aligns with time reversal; pacing is brisk but cohesive. Plot pivots logically from defiance to departure, though abrupt staircase reveal strains logic slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting merges with theme: vacuum garden's artificiality mirrors existential tension. Sensory details (salt/vacuum, fizzing fossils) immerse the reader in its surreal physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ('cosmic omelet') and symbolic actions (spinning shells) layer meaning. Ending's wink to darkness encapsulates thematic tension between agency/fate with sharp economy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in merging quantum metaphors with baroque absurdism. Avoids clich√©s but occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction that obscures emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (shells as fragments of choice, reversed time as rebellion). Prose remains vivid yet efficient in conveying multidimensional ideas within constraints.</comment>
