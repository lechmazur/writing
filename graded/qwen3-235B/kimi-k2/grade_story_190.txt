<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but not fully explored; transformation feels abrupt despite thematic resonance of smuggler's shift from stealing to listening. Voice lacks distinctiveness for a first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent within constraints, with the assigned action driving progression. Resolution via returning the butterfly creates thematic payoff, but pacing undercuts the emotional arc's credibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through sensory details: the drought's symbolic weight parallels emotional desiccation. Server room hum and butterfly dust create immersive atmosphere that meaningfully connects to theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story evokes emotional resonance through metaphor, particularly the butterfly-as-memory device. Subtext about empathy works well. Some 'telling' undermines 'showing,' and tone occasionally sacrifices precision for poeticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality is strong in conceptual fusion (musical memories in butterfly veins) but falters in emotional logic. The redemption arc feels familiar despite the unique premise, creating tension between novelty and convention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole with thematic momentum, though some components (drought prediction center) contribute less to narrative mechanics than others. Style enhances story despite minor lapses into abstraction.</comment>
