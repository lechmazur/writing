<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (to harness power) drives Arin's actions, but his philosophical shallowness feels underexplored until the abrupt moral pivot; insufficient groundwork for his transformation weakens character depth despite poetic execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plots shifts from theft to revelation are coherent but strained by the compressed arc; climax feels rushed despite strong image density, undercutting the emotional payoff of Arin's ideological shift.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually immersive and tactile—crystalline light, moon-rooted gardens, tri-lidded tears—but the extraterrestrial context occasionally feels like aesthetic ornamentation rather than integrated worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (moss as mercy, dominion vs. partnership) resonate beyond surface plot; lyrical prose conveys theme without didacticism. Final image lingers as a meditation on humility before nature.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Resists clichés: the moss-as-mediator, alien kindness-as-currency, and Arin's flawed ambition are inventive. Some phrases (e.g., "calculated dreams") risk obscuring rather than revealing character nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly seamless, though the jewelry's role as a memory trigger feels slightly mechanical. The brief form works by design but sacrifices deeper exploration of cross-species empathy mechanics.</comment>
