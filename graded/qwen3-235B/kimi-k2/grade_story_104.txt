<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's stoicism is consistent but underexplored; motivation tied to the cameo and apprentice's ideology lacks emotional depth; reactions to the crack in the diorama reveal resolve but feel narratively convenient rather than psychologically complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows methodically from quiet maintenance to revolutionary act; the cameo's activation of the fracture drives progression logically despite brevity; begins with oppressive order, escalates through subtle rebellion to decisive destruction; constrained scope creates satisfying micro-arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Museum setting is textured with vivid contrasts (sugar vs. marble, humming lullabies vs. creaking gates); sensory details (caramel rebellion, copper leaves) immerse readers; the miniature world's artifice serves theme of constructed reality without feeling derivative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subverts miniature motifs to explore conformity vs. liberation; ending resonates thematically through physical and metaphorical exits; tension between preservation and destruction sustained through precise symbolism; show-don't-tell dominates with nuanced subtext in objects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal objects (sawdust parliament, thread-river) but stumbles with over-lush phrases ("caramel rebellion"); some descriptions (orchard gate scent) feel purposeful rather than ornate; emotional subtext emerges through actions, not exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exquisite stylistic control balances economy with thematic weight; assigned elements function symbiotically (caged steward, encoded cameo) but some (vanishing note, security cameras) strain internal logic; concluding image lingers powerfully.</comment>
