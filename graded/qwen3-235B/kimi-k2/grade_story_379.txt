<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Background informs actions but guilt/tension feel underexplored; motivation connects to redemption but lacks emotional depth for a transformative arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong drive from dare but pacing prioritizes atmospheric details over tighter cause-effect logic; ending reinforces thematic resonance despite tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ghostly tech and vanishing languages create cohesion; biodome's cathedral-like glow contrasts with sterile preservation, though some details like courier drone's "lullaby" feel under-anchored.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of linguistic preservation and tech-thriller elements; emotional beats occasionally verge on melodramatic but avoid predictability through inventive imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><comment>Ambitious thematic synthesis of memory/loss, but underdeveloped character psychology and uneven pacing between action/backstory limit transcendence.</comment>
