<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; "playful" trait doesn't influence actions, and divine channeling feels tacked onto surface behavior without revealing interiority or compelling conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows poetic beats rather than causal progression; lacks traditional stakes and consequences despite visionary stakes. Resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through narrative logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blends striking originality with occasionally hollow poetic devices; some phrases border on ornamental abstraction while avoiding outright clich√©s; divine machinery remains intriguingly opaque rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements coexist harmoniously within their fictional logic but lack deeper narrative integration; style elevates content beyond mere assemblage of components while not fully transcending its puzzle-box construction.</comment>
