<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's past trades in saplings contrast with regret but remain vaguely defined; motivation to shatter illusion is clear but lacks nuanced internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot flows from decay to rebellion but pacing is uneven; surreal ascent feels rushed against dense imagery, diluting emotional payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Post-ecocide setting is viscerally rendered (salt-filled pockets, flaking posters); sensory details (burned forests, metallic regret) deepen atmosphere but some descriptors border on mannered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering (churn as reclaimed simplicity, sparks as uncontainable memory) elevates theme; ending's seed-in-vacuum lingers as haunting subversion of hope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in surreal elements (churn-climbing via propaganda) but occasionally collapses into stylistic excess without deeper purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements synergize around environmental guilt metaphor; however, the thinness of character psychology weakens overall cohesion.</comment>
