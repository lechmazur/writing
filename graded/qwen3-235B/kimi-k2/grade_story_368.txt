<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation to harvest hope is clear and consistent with her orphan background, but transformation lacks gradual complexity despite strong narrative voice. Reaction to the cameo ties to her streetwise nature but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves with deliberate rhythm and circularity, but the connection between reversed patterns and physical changes in the temple occasionally strains logic. Pacing is taut yet resolution feels slightly rushed despite satisfying arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is rich with tactile details (figs, ritual dust), but the orchard's decay/rebirth feels more atmospheric than thematically tied to Finch's internal journey. Cameo's connection to the cursed location underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (unwritten calendar, scars spelling "tomorrow") are striking, and the ending lingers emotionally. However, the central conflict of self-reinvention lacks visceral stakes despite lyrical execution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original in its mythic tone but skirts purple prose with excessive metaphor clusters (e.g., "fermenting in starlight"). Emotional resonance is evoked through imagery rather than character psychology; concept avoids clich√©s but occasionally becomes abstract.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around transformation-as-choice theme, with structure reinforcing motif of reversal. While the lyrical language enchants, the brevity leaves the emotional payoff just short of transcendent. Lingering echo concept elevates cohesion and depth.</comment>
