<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character voice is compelling, but lacks internal conflict or evolution; motivations remain abstractly tied to philosophical themes rather than grounded human impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lyrical digressions enrich theme but strain plot coherence; nested narrative structure sacrifices temporal urgency, leaving cyclical returns to the cup underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative olfactory/somatosensory details immerse readers, but the glass-city mythologizing feels extrinsic to the grounded sewer-orchiard duality that could have carried more psychological tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering achieves profound thematic resonance; the recursive structure (truth as cider as code) and haunting final image elevate it beyond mere allegory to ontological meditation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and metaphor innovation outweigh occasional ornateness; circumvents algorithmic writing through paradoxical logic (humble liar philosopher) and idiosyncratic similes like "voice soft as mold."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Exquisite wordcraft sustains thematic density within constraints, though philosophical abstractions occasionally outpace emotional immediacy; structure prioritizes poetic cohesion over dramatic development.</comment>
