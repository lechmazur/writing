<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are emotionally resonant but under-explored through-lines in key relationships (mother/child dynamics, ghostly witnesses). The 'elegantly clumsy' trait is symbolically rendered but lacks visceral, active demonstration of how it shapes decision-making beyond aesthetic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows elegant spiral structure but suffers from compressed causality between ghostly visitations and the final resolution. The child's crutch-dropped petal feels narratively engineered rather than organically earned, though the closing gesture of crumbling preservation achieves thematic completion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful integration of tactile details: saline humidity, crumbling silica, backward-blooming salt flowers create synesthetic atmosphere. The lab functions as existential crossroads between archiving impermanence and embracing collapse with precise, haunting coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose transcends surface narrative through layered metaphors (crown → entrapment/purification, silence → emotional suppression/deliverance). The recursive imagery of containment structures (castles, elevators) and their demolition through entropy produces lingering thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic supernatural tropes by treating ghosts as participatory audience rather than traditional antagonists. Some phrases ("whispers became corridor") border on abstraction. Emotional progression feels organically earned rather than algorithmically generated despite poetic density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements function interdependently with minimal superfluity. The brevity amplifies its haunting quality rather than feeling restrictive. The persistent tension between preservation/decay manifests through both micro-(flower petal) and macro-(architecture) scale details within a cohesive symbolic system.</comment>
