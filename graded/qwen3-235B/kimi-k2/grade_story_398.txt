<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Characters function as poetic symbols but lack psychological complexity; Mara's motivations are conceptually clear but emotionally underdeveloped, while Elias serves more as a thematic element than a realized character.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic progression exists but plot mechanics remain abstract; the connection between Mara and Elias feels teleological rather than earned through narrative logic despite effective circularity within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with striking elemental contrasts (wool/seawater, ashes/seeds) and sensory textures, though the mystical sanctuary's mechanics remain vaguely defined beyond its metaphysical function.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transcendent use of metaphor and symbolic layering—yarn as resistant storytelling, calendars merging time/renewal, ashes becoming generative soil—create resonant subtext that lingers beyond the narrative itself.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Avoids clichés through original imagery (machine-looms, time-as-yarn), though occasional overprecision (e.g., "dysfunctionally functional") slightly diminishes organic flow in otherwise distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Cohesion achieved through thematic spine and poetic economy, though structural ambition occasionally outpaces execution within the compressed form, leaving narrative foundations slightly exposed.</comment>
