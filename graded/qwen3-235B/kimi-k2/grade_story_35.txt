<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's quiet nature and horticultural skill inform his receptive behavior and symbolic actions, but his internal emotional complexity remains more implied than deeply explored; motivations stem from absence rather than active desire, limiting psychological specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows circular logic—beginning and ending with the same gesture—while maintaining momentum through sensory transformations, though the temporal leap to the child strains narrative cohesion within the constrained word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Poetic atmosphere created through synesthetic details (e.g., "colorless fire," "dialect only the heart could parse") establishes a liminal space where emotional abstraction becomes tangible, though the translation center's mechanics remain underdefined.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical resonance (emotion as flora, silence as fluency) and thematic unity, but some lyrical passages verge on opacity, diluting emotional immediacy; final image of intergenerational transmission elevates impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality lies in merging horticultural and linguistic frameworks, though occasional phrases ("longing watered him from within") risk sentimentality; overall, the treatment avoids formulaic emotion through precise, unconventional imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element integration is mostly organic, with the gardener's vocation, seed, and setting serving the theme of emotional growth, though the "universal translation center" feels conceptually thinner than other components; leaves a lingering, contemplative aftertaste.</comment>
