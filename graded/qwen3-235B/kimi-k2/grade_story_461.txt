<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sparse but effective use of archaic vocabulary ("thum-whump") avoids flowery excess; emotional journey feels organic despite high concept, though some transitional logic omitted for poetic economy</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Fusion of psychological realism and magical symbolism creates resonant whole; length imposes artificiality in secondary character development but amplifies singular focus on protagonist's arc.</comment>
