<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacks clear motivation for "sly agent" espionage elements; the family tradition and archiving drive the plot more, creating dissonance between assigned traits and actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rushes from activation to collapse; cause-effect logical but pacing compresses emotional impact; ending feels abrupt despite thematic resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival's sensory details (scent of popcorn/ozone, phantom sounds) create haunting atmosphere; some elements (ghost sightings) hinted but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphor of archiving as salvation; weaker moments rely on explicit emotional statements rather than subtext; theme of memory survives in digital form lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but contains overly ornate phrases ("rusted turnstile of the forgotten carnival"); metaphor of "digital halls" feels original but execution occasionally slips into generic melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a poignant narrative but lack transcendent emotional/philosophical depth; execution is polished but not groundbreaking.</comment>
