<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict between profit and preservation is hinted but remains underdeveloped; motivation driven more by mystical forces than psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively despite dense imagery, but the 500-word constraint creates compressed logic shifts; resolution feels hurried but thematically consistent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vividly oppressive atmosphere with rich sensory details; setting and mood are inseparable from the story's existential and botanical themes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolic imagery (vine-wrapped tower, sentient smoke) and layered subtext about commodification vs. creation; ending resonates as both metaphor and mystery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s but occasionally leans on luxuriant description that risks obscuring narrative momentum; metaphors feel earned rather than decorative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements like the xerograph and seed packets are innovatively integrated, though the grocery-store framing device feels more like a scaffolding constraint than thematic necessity.</comment>
