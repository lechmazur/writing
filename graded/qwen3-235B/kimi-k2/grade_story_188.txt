<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s actions align with motivation but psychological depth feels abbreviated; internal conflict is symbolized more than dramatized, lacking human-scale moments that would anchor his transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from conflict (letter) to resolution (planting), but the transition relies on metaphorical abstraction rather than narrative pressure; pacing occasionally sacrifices visceral engagement for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details (gunpowder-infused soil, rotted tapestries) coalesce into a tangible, resonant atmosphere; decay and renewal are viscerally embodied in the castle’s physical decay and natural cyclical rhythms.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Story achieves profound emotional resonance through layered symbolism (spectacles as accountability, letters as seeds) and a thematic through-line about cyclical violence; ending avoids sentimentalism by rooting hope in physical labor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction (“corroded rapture of gunpowder”), but mostly serves thematic purpose; metaphors are fresh and emotionally resonant rather than formulaic, with nuanced emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances allegorical weight; the fusion of violence’s residue into life-sustaining soil lingers as a potent, original meditation on legacy and redemption.</comment>
