<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's peaceful anger and internal conflict are well-established, but motivation (study sacred development) feels underexplored beyond surface plot; consistent traits and decisions maintain coherence but lack psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marks a clear arc with resonant beginning/middle/end, but planting season timeframe strains pacing - pivotal growth feels abrupt; thematic closure strong, narrative momentum occasionally uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Extinct language archive's atmospheric details (dust-as-pollen, glyph-carved flute) create vividly immersive worldbuilding that deeply enhances themes; tone-setting sometimes overwhelms character dimensionality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</comment>Metaphors (city as crypt, flute as language vessel) and poetic imagery create profound subtext about cultural/natural preservation; ending beautifully delivers emotional and intellectual resonance through symbolic showing rather than telling.</grade>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Refreshing fusion of ecological and linguistic motifs avoids standard fantasy; occasional repetitive phrasing ("taken chances") and slightly labored metaphors betray faint AI-adjacent tics in otherwise original work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Narrative maintains cohesive tension between organic and human elements across tight structure; linguistic resurrection motif and pocket soil detail provide lingering thematic resonance despite some compressed transitions.</comment>
