<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underdeveloped; trauma drives action but lacks nuance in emotional progression despite poetic imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compact structure with a discernible arc, but the resolution feels abrupt; the astral-to-physical return compresses emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and symbolic (carnival decay vs. rebirth), though astral elements occasionally undercut the grounded eeriness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (key, silver cord) resonate thematically; ending lingers with emotional and philosophical weight through subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Visionary concepts subvert genre tropes, but ornate phrasing ("sun shadows slid like liquid mercury") occasionally veers into self-indulgent abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements synthesize into a cohesive, theme-driven whole; the brevity feels purposeful, with haunting subtext about survival and shared redemption.</comment>
