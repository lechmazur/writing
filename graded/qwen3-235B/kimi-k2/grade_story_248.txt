<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually intriguing but lacks emotional depth; motivations are implied through action rather than demonstrated through internal or external conflict; voice feels more thematic than personal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; cause/effect relationships are present but underdeveloped; the arc is abstract rather than visceral, making pacing uneven within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid but inconsistently integrated; sensory details (zero-g, groaning hull) enhance mood, yet setting feels more like backdrop than immersive environment shaping character/action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong metaphors and thematic resonance elevate impact; the twist on prophecy is clever, though emotional weight relies more on poetic language than earned tension or subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Imaginative elements avoid overt clich√©s but occasionally veer into ornate abstraction; some phrases ("cosmic scream") feel derivative; emotional nuance is implied rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Ideas resonate, but cohesion is strained by uneven execution; the ending lingers thematically but leaves narrative gaps, suggesting potential rather than fully realized publishability.</comment>
