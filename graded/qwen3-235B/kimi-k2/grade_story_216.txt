<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's role as scapegoat is intriguing but insufficiently nuanced; motivation to reassemble identity lacks emotional depth; voice is distinct but inconsistent in revealing psyche via abstract metaphors.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compressed arc; cryptic calls drive action but their repetitive structure flattens momentum; ending resolves surface plot but sacrifices deeper emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Worldbuilding relies on vivid but isolated details (e.g. "neon veins") without systemic logic; tone-enhancing specifics clash with nebulous concepts like wind-whales; atmosphere and setting weakly intersect.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (washer as literal/metaphorical map) elevates impact; ending achieves thematic resonance but sacrifices narrative clarity; conflict resolved too neatly for its complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Creative use of hybrid concepts (e.g., "guilt as ink") avoids strict formulaic writing; however, descriptors like "stratospheric frost" verge on overwrought abstraction; emotional subtext remains surface-level despite poetic language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition exceeds execution; integration of elements like "cloud city" and "library card" feels superficial; thematic depth about identity redemption is undercut by plot contrivance.</comment>
