<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While Lysander's motivation to escape conformity is clear, his character remains archetypal, conveyed more through symbolic actions (sword dancing, static-fishing) than psychological depth; his "mindfully scattered" trait is consistently applied but thinly humanized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot adheres to a tight rise-fall arc (signal → consequence), with cause-effect logic intact despite word constraints; structural cohesion falters slightly in abrupt drone arrival scene, which lacks contextual foreshadowing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite integration of the setting's surreal contrasts (bird songs via hydrophones, coral-drones) creates immersive atmosphere; every element—from rusted blade to fogged telescope—visually reinforces the theme of individuation under siege.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("copper antennae braided with seagrass," "static spelling his true name") and thematic subtext (individuality as beacon/threat) elevate the prose; emotionally resonant but occasionally weighted by ornate phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids tropes through inventive syntheses (underwater cosmos, birdsong-dolphin audio warping); minimal purple prose, with descriptors serving metaphor rather than decoration; no mechanical repetition detected, though some imagery risks overabundance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through recurring symbols; every assigned element serves narrative purpose, though the brevity slightly underdevelops implications of "real birds" and coral regrowth; conceptually daring, with a lingering philosophical question.</comment>
