<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation and background imply depth but remain abstract; personality is defined more through mythic symbolism than concrete traits. Actions align with conceptual role, but humanizing specifics or emotional nuance are minimal.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through symbolic gestures rather than concrete stakes. The multiverse concept creates structural ambiguity; resolution feels poetic but lacks narrative weight due to compressed scope and underdeveloped tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Underwater city hall's decay merges with multiversal motifs through precise, haunting imagery. Sensory cohesion and atmospheric congruence elevate the setting beyond gimmickry, though practical logic of the environment occasionally falters.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphorical language ("bittersweet grit of color") and recursive structure create lingering resonance. Mythopoeic tone achieves emotional complexity through subtext rather than exposition; risks abstraction overconnection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in genre-blending (nautical ruin + quantum mythos). Avoids clich√©s through idiosyncratic metaphors ("apples as currency for sorrow") and emotionally restrained, cerebral prose that feels authored rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Integrates assigned elements with thematic coherence despite high abstraction. The cyclical seed motif and multiversal echoes suggest deeper conceptual purpose; execution prioritizes poetic density over conventional accessibility.</comment>
