<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Calder’s internal conflict and symbolism through gloves are compelling, but his nuanced motivations (e.g., past with the regent) could be more tightly woven into his actions and dialogue to avoid abstractness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc from invitation to rejection of the crown, but the compressed word limit forces some abrupt transitions (e.g., girl’s introduction) that slightly undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Superb sensory details (e.g., “smell of wet clay and turpentine,” glowing brick) create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere that mirrors Calder’s psychological stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (orchard as a “lock of living wood,” wolves biting their tails) deepen themes of containment vs. freedom, with a deliberate, resonant ending that avoids melodrama.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through fresh imagery (“branches arching like conspirators,” gloves as scars) and subtextual tension; language feels purposeful but never ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements (orchard, throne, gloves) are seamlessly fused into a cohesive whole, with economy of form that feels intentional rather than restrictive.</comment>
