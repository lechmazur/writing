<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character development is implied through symbolic actions and sparse backstory, but motivations remain opaque and emotional depth feels withheld rather than earned. The central conflict is established but lacks sufficient psychological anchoring.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is poetic but slight; atmospheric contemplation dominates over narrative momentum. The circular placement of coins and ultimate immersion serve symbolic purpose, yet structural arcs are too diffuse for the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral through tactile details (moss-slick stone, water's weight) and spectral imagery. However, the secret agent escape route element feels underdeveloped within an otherwise haunting, ambiguous setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Craft is exceptional: water as witness, scars-as-burden motifs, and sparse dialogue elevate thematic resonance. The ending achieves emotional density through precise imagery rather than explicit explanation, though some metaphors verge on overextension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality resides in sublimated trauma and unconventional redemption through surrender. Avoids clich√© through precise language, though AI-like tendencies surface in occasionally overdetermined symbolism (e.g., coins as explicit memory devices).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>The story balances assigned elements with narrative cohesion, though several components (e.g., secret agent framework) feel tangential. Ambiguity strengthens thematic resonance but weakens narrative urgency within the compressed format.</comment>
