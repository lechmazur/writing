<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prince's motivation of curing loneliness is consistent but remains somewhat ethereal without fully exposing his internal psychology; his transformation feels implied rather than deeply mined for emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc despite brevity, with cause-and-effect between snowstorm, key, and vials effectively structured, though the resolution with the woman feels compressed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details—snowstorm's intrusion, translucent walls revealing travelers—elevate the setting into a living space where memory and isolation physically manifest; sensory immersion is masterful.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., mortar sounds as bells) and theme of shared loneliness resonate emotionally; ending transcends surface plot but sacrifices some subtlety for explicit thematic declaration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some phrasing ("worn smooth by countless turns") risks cliche; tone wavers between mythic and introspective; emotional depth is shown effectively (mortar's warmth) but occasionally undercut by generalized descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</comment>Story integrates all elements cohesively, though the prince's archetype and resolution edge toward conventionality rather than radical reinvention of exile/redemption tropes.</comment>
