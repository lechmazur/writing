<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's formal precision and hunger for knowledge are distinct, but his internal logic is inconsistent; motivations remain cryptic rather than psychologically compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ritualistic structure and descent into dissolution create cohesion, but the elevator’s abrupt arrival disrupts the narrative flow’s organic tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral descriptions (crumbling sawdust, "cold subterranean wind") immerse readers in a mythic yet decaying space where knowledge consumes itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors ("knowledge devours its own map") and the recursive apple symbol create lingering resonance; the ending’s fatalistic irony elevates the conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>No trope reliance; each image (bones-as-bookmarks, elevator-as-erasure) feels freshly imagined and tonally purposeful. Avoids predictable awe in favor of claustrophobic paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Elements are meticulously braided into a closed symbolic system; the brevity sharpens its philosophical punch without sacrificing emotional unease.</comment>
