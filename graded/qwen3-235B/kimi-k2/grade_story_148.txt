<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lila’s transition from storm chaser to carousel keeper is emotionally credible but slightly underexplored; her desert-worn restlessness informs her nostalgia, yet her internal conflict occasionally feels resolved too neatly without deeper psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot’s cyclical structure (arrival-to-carousel-spun-homecoming) creates satisfying emotional symmetry, but the compressed timeline flattens secondary arcs (e.g., abbot/monks’ roles) and relies on serendipity (molten brass accident) to drive resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory fusion of alpine asceticism (bare wooden textures, cold) and desert residue (scarred skin) amplifies the protagonist’s duality; the tapestry’s “eternal summer” is a haunting visual counterpoint to the monastery’s stillness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Gear ratios as metaphor for “memory-to-motion” balance is intellectually resonant; the carousel’s transformation becomes a literal and symbolic “prayer,” with the tongs’ evolution from relic to tool mirroring Lila’s internal arc. Ending avoids sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in merging metallurgy with sacred restoration; “soldering mistakes into motion” redefines “inner strength” originally. Some phrases (“wind and prayers both spiral”) verge on overpolished aphorism, but lyrical restraint elsewhere (e.g., unspoken childless monastery) earns trust.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Every element serves a dual purpose—tongs as both literal tool and symbol, carousel as plot engine and theme embodiment. The ending’s “ratio of memory to motion” teaching distills the entire narrative into a haunting, universalizable image.</comment>
