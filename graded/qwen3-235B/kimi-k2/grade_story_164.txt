<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is vividly visualized but lacks interiority; motivation is implied through action rather than dramatized, preventing full emotional engagement. Subtlety in actions contrasts with overtly stated "wistful" traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a poetic logic of transformation but lacks tangible stakes or progression beyond ephemeral imagery. The cyclical structure (beginning/end with scent shifts) is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is immersive and sensorially rich, layering contradictions (neon vs. green, synthetic vs. organic) to create a haunting cyberpunk-ecological fusion. Atmosphere overwhelms plot, though.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (dust motes as galaxies, spores as lullabies) and rhythmic prose achieve lyrical impact. Subtext about quiet rebellion and ecological hope resonates without didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inventive combinations (botanical tech-guerilla gardening). Language borders on ornate but stays grounded in vivid specificity ("petrichor instead of ozone"). Nuanced emotion emerges through action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive aesthetic but lack thematic weight beyond surface beauty. Style serves theme but could push deeper into philosophical or political implications of "reclaiming the wild."</comment>
