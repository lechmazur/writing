<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amelia’s identity as "lost heiress" is mostly symbolic rather than deeply integrated into her psychology; her "bitterly optimistic" voice lacks consistent tonal distinction between internal monologue and narrative prose. Emotional resonance is undercut by underdeveloped backstory motivating her scientific obsession.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Non-linear pacing creates tension but sacrifices cohesion—detour to scenic overlook feels contrived, while the abrupt shift from observing clouds to confronting her mother’s ghost lacks necessary emotional buildup. The cyclical structure (station → cliff → station) is conceptually tight but narratively condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Visually striking (fractured skies, prismatic glass) but over-relies on abstract descriptors; the cliff’s sensory details outpace the station’s sterile atmosphere. The "vapor-creatures" establish eerie atmosphere, yet the setting’s scientific plausibility struggles against abrupt supernatural elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., parking stub as liminal artifact, clouds as fractured memory) resonate intellectually and emotionally. The central theme—unifying fragmented selves through speculative means—is poignant, though the epiphany risks being overstated during Amelia’s final ascent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lost heiress" and "parking stub" avoid cliché but lean on familiar "rejection of wealth" tropes; fragmented reality is evocatively rendered but occasionally relies on passive, poetic abstraction ("reality splintered into prismatic shards") that dilutes character agency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual ambition outweighs technical polish—some prescribed elements (e.g., "detour to avoid traffic") feel artificial. The ending’s thematic synthesis is moving but strained by the 500-word constraint; lingers more as an idea than a fully realized narrative.</comment>
