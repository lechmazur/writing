<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Deputy Vale's impassivity establishes her observational role, but her interiority remains underexplored; her motivation to witness grace is poetic but lacks personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure maintains atmospheric continuity through cyclical motifs, but the plot resolution leans heavily on symbolic abstraction rather than concrete narrative progression within the constrained frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hyper-specific sensory details (rust-oil floor, wax corridors) create an immersive, dreamlike cohesion; the cathedral-orchard-machine symbiosis evokes profound tension between industrial decay and organic resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors ("liquid scripture," "consecrated ash") and thematic layering of grace/sin duality create lingering resonance; the final hum-as-jurisdiction twist is emotionally subtle but intellectually potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through inventive juxtaposition (sacred bees, mechanical Eucharist), though occasional phrases ("slow-motion snow") verge on preciousness; emotional restraint prevents formulaic catharsis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion emerges through recurring heartbeat motifs and ritualistic repetition; some abstract elements (orchard's hydrocarbon rain) risk conceptual murkiness despite poetic surface.</comment>
