<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's "openly private" trait is demonstrated through physical concealment but lacks psychological depth; motivation to escape mundane existence remains abstract rather than concrete action. Minimal emotional arc beyond vague rejuvenation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through concrete actions (stealing ladle, touching meteorite) but lacks urgency; rejuvenation-by-meteorite-texture mechanism feels underdeveloped; ending's thematic closure undermines narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with visceral details (smell of pine/thunder, "cedar planks") but "rush hour" timeframe adds little; some inconsistencies (how a meteorite saltcellar functions spatially) undermine immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors ("silence bloom like frost," "hidden sea") elevate storytelling; subtext about artistic transcendence is compelling, though minimal conflict weakens emotional stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality in blending cosmic and domestic imagery; some phrases ("gentle turmoil," "harvest moons" for eyes) border on clich√©. Avoids formulaic structure but leans on archetypal "magical object" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements function collectively for atmospheric cohesion, though the meteorite-ladle mechanism strains plausibility; brevity works for poetic vignette but sacrifices narrative complexity.</comment>
