<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually cohesive with assigned traits (rebelliousness, obituarist role), but lacks dimensional psychology beyond metaphorical function; motivation to restore death-songs drives action but inner contradictions remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves narrative symmetry (seeking/capturing death-songs) with organic cause-effect through sensory resonance as method. Pacing manages complexity within constraints, though some transitions between symbolic revelations could be better weighted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dreamlike setting combines tactile details (dust, cold metal) with conceptual metaphors (bookshelves as tombs). Revolution's atmosphere adds urgency without over-explanation; the organ chamber's emergence feels both surprising and inevitable within the world's internal logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral imagery (organ-pipes breathing, mask cycling discarded selves) creates lingering impact. Ending transcends mere resolution to thematic culmination. Some emotional beats rely on linguistic density rather than character-specific pathos.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overused tropes through death-songs-as-resistance concept and porcelain mask's psychological mirroring. Occasional elaborate phrasing ("caged bird heart") borders on excess but generally serves the story's mythic tone without feeling algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically—the bookshelf's spatial logic, mask's emotional truth, labyrinth-as-choice structure—without feeling checklist-driven. The final transformation from sorrow to hope lingers intellectually rather than emotionally.</comment>
