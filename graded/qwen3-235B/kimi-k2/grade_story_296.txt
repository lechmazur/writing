<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Characterization lacks emotional depth; motivations feel abstract rather than visceral. Her internal conflict ("hatefully adored") is superficially sketched, and despite poetic prose, the protagonist remains a vessel for metaphor rather than a psychologically distinct person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plot's ritualistic progression (aligning chopsticks, naming plankton) is conceptually cohesive but structurally flimsy. The word limit strains cause-effect logic during her transformation, leaving the resolution feeling abrupt despite lyrical interludes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral atmospheric fusion: the submarine's biomechanical groans mirror her psyche; fluorescent dying-light rituals create temporal urgency. Submarine-specific sensory details (creaking hulls synced to breath, pressure-steamed lotus root) make the setting a participatory force rather than backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful use of micro-sensory symbolism (splintered chopsticks as spiritual compasses) and conceptual metaphors (whale song as narrative punctuation). The ending's thematic resonance about slowness as revelation elevates the meditation on order-from-chaos beyond mere surface motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uneven originality; while "cookbook instructions as spiritual guide" surprises, the "engineer who drinks too much" cliché betrays formulaic thinking. Some phrases ("familiar enigma") risk pretension, though the plankton-naming sequence avoids bathos through precise juxtaposition of fears and bioluminescence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>7.5</comment>The constraint shapes rather than cripples it—the submarine's physicality forces structural containment. The story's strength lies in thematic persistence (chaos/order) rather than narrative ambition, with most elements (chopsticks, cookbook) organically serving that singular focus.</grade>
