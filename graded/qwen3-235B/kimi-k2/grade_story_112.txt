<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Underdeveloped protagonist despite vivid actions; motivation is clear but psychological complexity feels surface-level, with internal conflict implied rather than explored. 'Factually imaginative' trait isn't fully integrated into character's decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arc exists but lacks propulsion—hopscotch sequence dominates middle without sufficient rising tension. Pacing uneven; ending achieves thematic cohesion but resolution feels abrupt, undercutting emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is the story's backbone—sensory details (copal smoke, melting snow, dust) create a mythic, tactile environment. Timeframe-setting connection ("snowflake melts") enhances ephemerality theme through its recurring motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphor-drenched prose (recipes as dance, smoke as "vowels of steam") elevates narrative. Subtext about cultural preservation vs. erasure resonates through layered symbolism. Ending achieves haunting, cyclical resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in marrying hopscotch to culinary mnemonics and archiving as cultural resistance. Occasional phrases ("churro-coiled spiral") verge on overwrought, but subversion of "archive" tropes and non-linear storytelling feel daringly inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements serve theme rather than the reverse—handkerchief/recipes connection, hopscotch as encoding method, and archive setting all reinforce ideas of impermanence and preservation in harmony with tone.</comment>
