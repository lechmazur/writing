<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character remains abstract and symbolic rather than fully realized; transformation from fact-minded to empathetic feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized through specific actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Circular structure works thematically but creates some confusion; transitions between vignettes are elegant yet occasionally disjointed within tight word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details ground the surreal setting, but some descriptions verge on self-indulgent excess without deepening the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impressive conceptual coherence exists, but abstract symbolism occasionally distances readers from experiencing the emotional catharsis it deserves.</comment>
