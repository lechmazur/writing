<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation (shame as a prison) is clear but underdeveloped; emotional complexity is hinted at but remains abstract, prioritizing metaphor over human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a cohesive arc (activation of orchard, confrontation with shame) but relies on poetic leaps rather than cause-effect clarity; pacing feels rushed in key emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and original, blending neon cyberpunk with organic decay, but some descriptions verge on pretentious abstraction, diluting immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic subtext (shame as a living, fracturable entity) elevate impact; occasional overt exposition weakens "showing" in favor of lyrical "telling."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of biopunk and emotional surrealism; some phrases ("luminous regret") flirt with cliché, and tonal shifts occasionally feel algorithmically fluid rather than purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a emotionally resonant whole, though abstract symbolism risks vagueness; brevity feels deliberate but occasionally obscures narrative grounding.</comment>
