<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Brother Aldric’s zealotry is thematically clear but thinly developed; his motivations hinge on abstract concepts of sacrifice and legacy without emotional or psychological complexity that transcend symbolic function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a quiet ritualistic arc but lacks tension or transformation; pacing is deliberate but risks static energy, with a resolution that feels more symbolic than earned through narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (copper, ozone, tallow) and the lab’s industrial-spiritual fusion create a vivid, immersive setting that deepens the story’s metaphysical themes without redundancy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and symbolic resonance (currency as legacy, ash as scripture) elevate impact, though the story leans on poetic abstraction over visceral emotional engagement, slightly diluting its lasting grip.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in blending science and ritual is striking, but some descriptors (e.g., “kingfisher-blue ink”) flirt with ornamentation, risking detachment from human nuance in favor of stylization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Cohesive and conceptually polished, with each element serving theme, though the brevity and symbolic density may limit broader emotional resonance beyond intellectual appreciation.</comment>
