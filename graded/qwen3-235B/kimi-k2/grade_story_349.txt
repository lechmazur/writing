<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Character motivations are poetically implied but underdeveloped; the drone pilot's cynically hopeful nature remains more atmospheric than psychologically grounded, though interactions with herb bundle and axe reveal thematic tensions. Dialogue feels stylized but lacks human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is impressionistic but logically disjointed; speed dating as dissemination method feels forced despite lyrical momentum. Connections between beginning/end are symbolic rather than cause-and-effect, with momentum built through imagery rather than narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through vivid, synesthetic details—burnt plastic scent in herbs, starlight through bullet holes, orchard as condemned prisoners. The medieval-fantasy-meets-decayed-tech tone is cohesive yet hauntingly evocative; setting actively shapes character and theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Linguistic precision and metaphorical density (drone-shaped smoke, low-orbit dialogue) create lingering resonance. Subtext about salvaging hope through ritualized compassion emerges organically. Emotional beats are shown through ritual and gesture rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresh combinations—herbs as surrender flag, speed dating as emotional salvage—avoid genre tropes. Some phrasing leans close to ornate abstraction ("contrails of answers"), but the synthesis of decay and rebirth feels distinctly authorial rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story coheres as poetic parable, though thematic density occasionally overshadows narrative urgency. The brief form feels integral—each paragraph functions as a stanza—but some conceptual elements (e.g., axes' restraint) require more earned resolution.</comment>
