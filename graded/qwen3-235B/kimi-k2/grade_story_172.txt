<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to escape prophecy is clear, but nuanced internal conflict remains underexplored despite strong external alignment with actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with reversed wishes driving action; slight pacing stumbles in connecting photos to prophecy undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (salt light, wet teeth corridors) immerse readers, though settingâ€™s symbolic weight occasionally strains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Elements integrate cohesively; concise length enhances urgency, though some connections (photos, prophecy) feel undernourished.</comment>
