<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but remains overshadowed by poetic abstraction; the envoy's envy and transformation feel symbolic rather than organic, with emotional depth sacrificed to metaphor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story maintains structural coherence through the envoy's ritualistic arc, though the compressed word limit flattens tension and resolution into a single, elliptical sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Visually immersive but thematically disconnected; the alien plain and greenhouse’s fractured beauty fails to integrate fully with the character’s internal stakes or the broader narrative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Masterful use of linguistic precision and metaphor—phrases like "garrote of light" and "liquid constellations" linger in the imagination to elevate the narrative beyond its plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids cliché through inventive imagery, but repetitive descriptors ("furious tranquility") and ornate syntax occasionally undermine the prose’s clarity and emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story’s atmospheric richness and thematic heft are undercut by its opacity; ideas of legacy and transformation resonate, but the narrative feels more aesthetic than emotionally urgent.</comment>
