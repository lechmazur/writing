<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dr. Bellwether's actions are motivated by obsession, which aligns with her character, but her inner conflicts and deeper psychology remain underexplored despite surreal context. The carnivorous plants add visual flair but lack thematic integration into her personal stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear progression from the tea house to the tunnel, but pacing during the discovery of the belt's function feels rushed. The film-revelation-to-decision sequence lacks subtle bridging, and the ending's abruptness sacrifices emotional resonance for spectacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral, original atmosphere combining botany and alpine mysticism. Sensory details like yak-butter vapor and snow petals create an unforgettable environment. However, the setting occasionally veers into self-indulgent surrealism that risks alienating emotional engagement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exquisite prose with vivid metaphors ("floating spores spelling 'Choose'"). The story balances whimsy and dread through tone consistency. While it prompts reflection on obsession's boundaries, the final choice feels archetypal rather than emotionally earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-trope pitfalls with specific details like 'Venus-flytrap mouths' as a visualization method, but phrases like 'chlorophyll-crazed mind' tip into ornate abstraction. The fusion of science and mysticism elevates originality, though some emotional stakes remain stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>All elements are present and interconnected, though some—like the teahouse music’s warning—feel tacked on thematically. The brevity works for the surreal tone but creates a slight emotional distance. The final image is memorable, suggesting but not fully achieving greatness.</comment>
