<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is vividly sketched with specific traits (wryness, warmth, aloofness) that inform her actions, but lacks psychological depth beyond atmospheric melancholy; motivations are implied rather than fully dramatized with concrete memories or decisions.</comment><question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive symbolic progression from ritualistic chalk-drawing to vanishing, but tension between concrete action and abstract concept weakens causal links; resolves too neatly into thematic abstraction without earned emotional payoff.</comment><question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Retro-futuristic cargo hold details create palpable atmosphere with ozone, rusted crates, and flickering lights, though some elements (e.g. rotary phone in space) risk feeling contrived rather than organically worldbuilt.</comment><question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (chalk as “time’s confession,” time as “siren”) enrich meaning without overwhelming narrative; ending’s haunting image of the spiral’s ghost creates lasting resonance; occasional overwriting (“bruised nebulae”) slightly undermines otherwise precise lyricism.</comment><question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evokes unique metaphysical concepts through original metaphors but occasionally succumbs to ornamental phrasing (“cargo of absences”); emotional beats rely more on poetic abstraction than visceral character embodiment, bordering on mannerism.</comment><question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into unified aesthetic despite brevity; symbolic economy works conceptually but sacrifices deeper exploration of character history or worldbuilding; ending lingers through ambiguity rather than resolution.</comment><question>7 A</question><grade>6.8</grade>
