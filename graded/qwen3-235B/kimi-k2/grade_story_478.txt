<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's role as a critical midwife drives her actions and motivations, but internal conflicts remain underdeveloped. Her arc aligns with her "openly secretive" nature, though emotional depth feels surface-level despite symbolic gestures like the diaries.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear trajectory from discovery to transcendence, but the rapid shift from herb-ritual to memory-liberation lacks emotional buildup. Cause/effect logic works, though the moon's role feels underutilized structurally.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The maelstrom and orchard create a visceral, mythic atmosphere. Details like "amniotic salt" and "sweet emptiness" tie setting to theme. Timeframe under a waxing moon enhances the ritualistic tone, though its specific impact on plot remains diffuse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush and metaphor-dense, effectively evoking ethereal tension. The ending resonates thematically, though occasional abstraction ("a lantern without oil") risks vagueness. Subtext about memory-as-currency adds texture.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in the orchard-as-memory-devourer concept, but over-reliance on "twilight" and "dissolving into wind" feels clichéd. Emotional beats are shown through action, though some imagery (e.g., "larks as infant cries") verges on overdetermined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Elements coalesce around memory sacrifice, though herbs and timeframe feel slightly ornamental. The story’s brevity sharpens its mystical tone rather than undermining it, and the final image of a "new midwife" invites ethical contemplation.</comment>
