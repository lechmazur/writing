<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's muteness drives the plot and symbolic gestures but lacks deep interiority, relying on atmospheric cues instead of nuanced psychology to reveal motivation and conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but could benefit from tighter cause-effect logic in pivotal moments (e.g., cellar's sentience). Pacing is deliberate but occasionally risks stagnation through excessive descriptive stasis.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</comment>Exceptional sensory immersion creates a vivid, cohesive world where the opera house becomes a character in itself, with snow, decay, and celestial phenomena meaningfully integrated into thematic and emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (paper throat, snowflakes-as-notes) and layered metaphors elevate the narrative, though some poetic abstractions may dilute emotional immediacy. The ending's thematic clarity and subversion of escape tropes powerfully reward engagement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality in subverting portal fantasy tropes and weaving sensory details into metaphor. Avoids clich√© through precise, unconventional imagery ("lantern flickered once in reply") but occasionally flirts with ornamental excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A cohesive whole where setting, character, and concept serve each other. The compressed length enhances the poetic focus but may frustrate those prioritizing action over metaphysical resolution. Lingering thematic resonance is strong but not fully balanced with character payoff.</comment>
