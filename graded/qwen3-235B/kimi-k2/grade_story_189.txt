<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lira’s “bright-eyed” determination lacks depth; her transition from apprentice to architect feels abrupt and insufficiently earned. Internal motivations remain abstract, tethered more to symbolic arcs than visceral human experience. Her use of “uniquely literal” logic isn’t clearly differentiated beyond plot mechanics.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a linear, purposeful arc of discovery, but the climactic confrontation with the ghost and its thematic question feels underdeveloped. Pacing is efficient but leans on poetic shorthand (e.g., “circuits cooling from overcharge”) rather than structural tension. The connection between decoding notes and opening the chamber is logical but emotionally inert.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Achieves visceral immersion through salt-crusted stairs and phosphorescent mold, but the setting’s deeper potential—haunted lighthouse as character, water-war aftermath—is underexploited. Sensory details evoke a singular world, though coherence falters where abstract imagery (e.g., “ceiling was the night sky itself”) overshadows setting logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually arresting and conceptually rich—star maps as seawater droplets, the ethical tension between wonder and survival—imprint the story with thematic resonance. The ghost’s question lingers as subtext. Dialogue is sparse but impactful; the ending’s “pockets full of starlight” elevates the plot into metaphor. Overly ornate phrasing occasionally muffles emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise and fresh metaphors (“gulls screamed as if the war still burned canals”) dominate, though some phrases (“brazen calm” repeated) risk circularity. Character psychology remains opaque, leaning on atmospheric vagueness rather than nuanced emotional interplay. The choice to route cosmic engineering through phone booths is inventive, bordering on surreal.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story coheres through lyrical urgency, though the brevity leaves certain elements (Lira’s past, the war’s specifics) underexplored. Assigned elements are skillfully woven into a singular vision, but the final “Return” ash-scrawl and melted glaciers’ dawn verge on mythic abstraction, sacrificing grounding for elegance.</comment>
