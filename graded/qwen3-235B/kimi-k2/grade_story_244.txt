<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some depth in guilt's influence on her trade and the mask's significance, but lacks visceral exploration of her past as swordswoman. Motivation felt implied rather than fully embodied through actions beyond mask fixation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong cause-effect progression from petal drop to mirror confrontation. Pacing leans toward rushed in middle segments about historians' half-truths. Clear narrative arc despite word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ethereal violet glow and humming neon create strong atmosphere, but neon shop's connection to her guilt remains underdeveloped. Sensory consistency weakened by uneven concrete details (e.g., absent soundscape).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness in mirror/reflection symbolism and "guilt as armor" resonates. Subtext about acceptance over absolution carries weight, though emotional impact diluted by occasional over-reliance on abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with the mirror-as-choice concept, but contains some self-indulgent phrasing ("electric lullaby") and inconsistent emotional nuance. Stronger moments exist without fully transcending genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><grade>Elements form cohesive whole with minimal forced integration, though historians/burden concepts could have deeper resonance. Leaves intellectual/emotional aftertaste despite lingering surface-level exposition.</grade>
