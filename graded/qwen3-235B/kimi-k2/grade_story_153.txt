<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's detachment and academic focus are consistent with studying immortality across eons, but emotional depth is sacrificed for poetic abstraction. The protagonist's motivations remain conceptually clear but psychologically opaque.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Precision of time-scarred progression impresses, yet the concluding shift to a wish-fulfillment cosmos feels narratively disjointed. The journal-as-plot-engine mechanism remains logically coherent but the final choice lacks earned emotional consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cavernous olfactory decay and tactile descriptions of cracked glass create immersive subterranean melancholy. The headlamp's ember-as-debt-metaphor merges perfectly with the setting's existential weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphorical richness of graduation-as-cosmic-creation achieves transcendence. The final image of clipping the lamp back "to my satchel" carries haunting permanence through its ritualistic banality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original premise of academic pursuit in post-cosmic times avoided genre traps. Some phrasing ("loyal thought," "private sun") skirts clich√© beauty but overall maintains narrative purpose through disciplined imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Every prescribed element synergizes thematically: mole people's reverence contrasts with protagonist's cynicism, the lamp's impossible power mirrors eternal scholarship. The closing descent feels more thematically necessary than narratively satisfying.</comment>
