<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Characters defined through symbolic actions and legacy rather than psychological depth; protagonist’s voice is lyrical but lacks distinctiveness beyond serving the mythic tone</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot flows from ritualistic decision-making, but the bridge’s transformation feels abrupt without clear emotional payoff; pacing balances brevity with significance</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on sensory dissonance: decay (rusted engines, cracked tiles) juxtaposed with lyrical cosmic metaphors creates immersive, haunting worldbuilding</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (coffee stains as runways, birds as bridges) elevate craft; ending resonates thematically but slightly strains suspension of disbelief with mystical shift</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids conventionality through hybrid myth-sci-fi elements but occasionally over-relies on ornate descriptors (“fractal sorrow”); emotional nuance present but occasionally subsumed by symbolism</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</question><comment>Elements cohere into poignant metaphor for storytelling as salvation; brevity feels purposeful, though abstraction risks distancing readers from raw emotional stakes</comment>
