<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Underdeveloped secondary traits undercut core rigor; emotional transformation feels condensed but consistent with established rigidity. Motivation clashes with implied mother-child dynamic not fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight arc undermined by abrupt cause-effect between adhesive analysis and existential revelation. Pacing falters during bulb-pulse resolution while maintaining superficial coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory alchemy between gravestones and greenhouse decay; Tesla's bulb creates dissonant anachronism tension rather than harmony. Tone-perfect but conceptually conflicted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphors strain toward profundity (runes-spelling-regret); ending's "arms no longer steel" lacks earned vulnerability. Subtext about empathy's fragility resonates beneath overwritten flourishes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre templates but occasionally lapses into adjective-heavy cataloging of decay. Emotional progression feels human-nuanced despite compressed timeline. Conceptual framing resists algorithmic predictability.</comment>
