<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (healing through memory) is clear but lacks visceral nuance; transformation feels abstract rather than earned through concrete actions. The "gracefully awkward" trait remains underexplored beyond bike-wobbling gestures.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Repetition of bike rides structures the narrative but muddies momentum; the shift from nightmares to active healing is abrupt. The ossuary restaurant provides strong architectural cohesion, though the ending resolution feels prematurely saccharine in a story otherwise committed to ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Visceral sensory coupling of culinary and funerary elements (skull tureens holding soup, marrow-as-soil) creates haunting juxtapositions. The synesthetic pine vs. smoke coda demonstrates atmospheric mastery, though the bicycle's physicality occasionally clunks against the ethereal tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The seed cake menu substitution works as potent metaphor, but emotional beats (tourists weeping) verge on didacticism. The dissolution of the coded letter into memory as cipher is particularly elegant, though the spectral soldiers risk metaphorical overreach.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Some sections (rotisserie rhythms mirroring heartbeats) showcase precise, organic imagery, but phrases like "harsh tenderness" and "ragged caravan of penitents" employ contradictory descriptors that feel more conceptually clever than emotionally authentic. The bike ride repetitions risk algorithmic cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story transcends its elemental skeleton through the radical reimagining of nourishment as reparative justice, but the transition from trauma to redemption occurs without sufficient thematic friction. The final image lingers, though the healing arc mirrors too neatly redemptive eco-narrative templates.</comment>
