<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaknesses include vague motivations that lean on abstraction rather than human-scale specificity, though the courierâ€™s frayed resilience and symbiosis with the ink pot create memorable character-object integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through surreal logic, but pacing stumbles slightly during the metaphysical ink revelation; ends with a poetic arc but lacks a concrete narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Breathtaking sensory world-building with mythic undertones anchors the story in a tangible, emotionally resonant atmosphere that deepens the theme. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional emotional subtext emerges through striking metaphors (courage as "ordinary choices"), with lyrical prose that elevates the story into a meditation on human resilience. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some lush descriptions border on self-indulgent ("jubilant despair"), but emotionally resonant metaphors and organic integration of myth avoid full "purple prose" territory. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements are cohesively woven, though the "urban legend" method feels underdeveloped; brevity enhances poetic impact without sacrificing thematic depth. </comment>
