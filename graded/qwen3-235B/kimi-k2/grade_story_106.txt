<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (Mara seeks escape from debts/loss) and her action of stitching stamps to quilt reveals desperation and creative resolve. However, emotional transformation relies heavily on metaphors rather than layered psychological development.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent mythic arc (descent, transformation, return) within word limits. The stamp-stitching action effectively drives momentum, though townspeople addition feels slightly rushed. Beginning/end connection works, with dead end becoming a beginning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Underwater turbine hall creates haunting atmosphere with vivid sensory details (cracked glass roof, bioluminescent quilt, salt air). Connection between Mara's salt-stung fields and underwater setting is particularly strong. Atmosphere deeply supports emotional journey.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Powerful emotional resonance through metaphor rather than exposition. The quilt-as-border map metaphor effectively conveys theme of erasure. Ending avoids triteness with "luminous field" and "stamps whispering itineraries." Some poetic lines veer close to self-indulgence but mostly work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original treatment of common themes (escape, reinvention). Avoids clich√© through specific, striking imagery (bioluminescent coral patches, un-sticking stamps, valence of "borrowed" to "unborrowed" valor). Metaphors feel fresh rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Despite tight word limit, elements cohere into powerful symbolic system. Quilt-as-journey metaphor gives structural unity. Brief length feels deliberate, with poetic compression working in its favor. Leaves lingering questions about transformation mechanics but successfully implies more than it states.</comment>
