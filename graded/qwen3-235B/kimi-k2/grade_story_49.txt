<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's peculiar nature and lukewarm magic are evocative but remain primarily symbolic rather than deeply embodied; motivations are suggested through poetic imagery rather than dramatized choices that reveal internal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot advances through metaphysical actions rather than traditional narrative beats; momentum derives from lyrical accumulation rather than conflict resolution, which suits the tone but reduces narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exquisitely rendered through precise lunar gravity details, sensory metaphors ("flavor of surviving"), and the base's ruined grandeur; the setting actively *is* the story's emotional architecture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose achieves haunting resonance through metaphors that crystallize abstractions ("ash" for regret, "guilty secrets" for light); the ending risks sentimentality but earns its transcendence through tight thematic focus on forgiveness as an active process.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rarely descends into clich√© but occasionally relies on atmospheric vagueness over narrative specificity; poetic density avoids formulaic structures yet occasionally veils emotional immediacy beneath ornamental language.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements are purposefully interwoven (e.g., torn mat's physicality mirrors emotional fragmentation) but lean on thematic repetition rather than dramatic progression; the brevity emphasizes poetic impact over conventional narrative arcs.</comment>
