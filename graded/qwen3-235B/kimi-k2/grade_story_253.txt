<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Finch's duality as a "polite bandit" and his guilt over past silence create tension, but his internal conflict lacks sufficient depth to fully justify transformation at the climax.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but the rapid shift to time manipulation feels underdeveloped despite logical cause-effect chain. Pacing works for brevity but lacks nuance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with metallic organic fusion, but sensory details like "flickering firewalls" occasionally cross into abstraction. The harp's integration strains believability slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of time as backward melody and holograms as dying candles provide strong symbolic resonance. Ending delivers satisfying closure while maintaining thematic ambiguity about changing the past.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with mechanical flora and code-as-music concepts. Some phrases ("whispered algorithms") border on overwrought, but emotional understatement in Finch's sacrifice reads authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Creative element synthesis (bandit using music to rewrite time) elevates premise. The clipped structure feels intentional rather than restrictive, though thematic weight occasionally overshadows narrative clarity.</comment>
