<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's grief and motivation to document change are palpable but underexplored; his "passionate indifference" lacks concrete behavioral grounding beyond abstract dialogue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Repetitive circular structure sacrifices momentum; plot adheres to the brief's constraints but unfolds more as vignette than narrative with sustained tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Luminous, immersive details like "marble floors" meeting "humming tubes" create tension between past and future; some worldbuilding elements feel undercontextualized (e.g., secret society's role).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (silence as testimony, parade tech as elegy) and cyclical construction elevate thematic resonance; emotional undercurrents emerge through haunting imagery rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Uncommon symbolic choices (applause as "cave-in") subvert tropes; poetic economy avoids formulaic language. Some phrases risk obscurity but maintain stylistic integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><grade>High-concept elements cohere thematically but occasionally strain narrative logic; compression serves metaphor over plot development.</grade>
