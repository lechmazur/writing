<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong symbolic character arc, but emotional shifts lack sufficient psychological nuance to justify the rapid transformation. The stoicism vs. sincerity duality is conceptually rich but feels slightly schematic in execution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive arc but relies on excessive compression. The inciting incident (wallet return) creates narrative momentum yet some transitions between key moments feel hurried, undermining emotional credibility within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting with memorable sensory texturesâ€”beeswax, honey, propolis create visceral atmosphere. Sanctuary's ecological precision beautifully contrasts technological isolation. Slight overuse of lavender/regret association strains metaphor.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Potent central metaphors (radio vs. bees, static vs. truth) elevate thematic resonance. Emotional subtext is often implied rather than stated, though occasional declarative conclusions ("untamed sincerity wasn't weakness") dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Original metaphoric scaffolding avoids typical tropes, but some phrases (e.g., "pulsed with radio waves") verge on florid abstraction. Emotional progression occasionally veers toward pat resolution despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Interwoven elements create compelling thematic unity. The brevity amplifies the symbolic economy, though the conclusion's thematic statement risks undercutting subtle ambiguity established earlier.</comment>
