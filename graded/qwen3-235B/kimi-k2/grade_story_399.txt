<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations around trauma are emotionally resonant but inconsistently aligned with actions; the "grumpy" attribute feels underdeveloped beyond surface bitterness, and the pivotal act of confronting the photograph lacks psychological specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stargazing framework creates cyclical structure, but the plot's emotional arc (from uprising to stillness) sometimes prioritizes poetic abstraction over concrete progression, leaving the transformation feeling slightly procedural rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, original details like prismatic starlight and sand constellations create visceral atmosphere; however, the witch's absence weakens the setting's thematic integration, making the "scrying room" feel more like stage dressing than a narrative force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (trauma as orbiting moons, darkness as womb) elevate the story; the conflict between burial and remembrance is viscerally embodied through tactile imagery, though some lines risk self-seriousness without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Originality in conceiving trauma as a physical object and sand as memory container coexists with overly familiar motifs (soldiers lowering banners, darkness vs. light dichotomy); the prose occasionally veers into mannered lyricism that dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion despite density of elements, with the tube and mandala forming a compelling symbolic axis; the ending lingers effectively, though the tight word limit leaves the thematic revelation feeling more implied than fully crystallized.</comment>
