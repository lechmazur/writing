<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Gareth's indifference is visually consistent, but the transition to will lacks emotional nuance; his motivation remains enigmatic rather than deeply explored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ritualistic progression works, but the dreamlike logic of the catacombs obscures cause/effect; pacing lingers at the threshold between poetic and sluggish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory alchemy (pale glow, cathedral dust, anvil-earth) creates immersive atmosphere; the setting is a character itself, though some descriptions border on excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (heart as cold iron, covenant sealed in ribs) resonate; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks sustained emotional climax despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Some adverb-heavy passages dilute impact ("whispered, voice soft as candle smoke"), yet recurring symbols (ribbon's color shift) avoid tired tropes with deliberate, human-feeling choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cathedral/blacksmith transformation coheres, though brevity leaves covenant mechanics undefined; linger-worthy in its fusion of mythic and mundane.</comment>
