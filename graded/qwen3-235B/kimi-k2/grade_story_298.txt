<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mei-Lin's shifting skin color and "rationally impulsive" duality are conceptually rich but underdeveloped; her motivations are consistent but lean on archetypal melancholy without deeper emotional grounding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to performance, but the cold-case research section feels compressed; the resolution's metaphysical ending could feel abrupt without the lyrical atmosphere scaffolding it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (cracked lanterns, "dripping water") and the oil-depletion decay metaphor create a haunting, cohesive atmosphere that deeply informs the narrative's emotional tenor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor ("light like a confession"), symbolic layering (color as identity), and haunting subtext about art's redemptive power elevate the story's emotional and thematic impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through original combinations (chameleonic actors solving historical mysteries) and resists easy resolutions; prose remains purposeful despite occasional ornate descriptions that never overwhelm narrative flow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interlock with precision—especially sunlight/debris and the dress—but the brevity slightly constrains the cold-case exposition; the ending's thematic resonance lingers powerfully.</comment>
