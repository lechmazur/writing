<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to restore tradition is clear but underdeveloped; her actions feel archetypal rather than psychologically nuanced, and the oracle's cryptic nature remains superficial despite rich potential for layered symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a cohesive arc from discovery to action, but the tight word limit strains the emotional payoff; the shift to baking rebellious cookies feels abrupt, lacking progression that might fully justify her defiance within such a compressed narrative.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Stunning sensory immersion through kaleidoscope imagery, tart persimmon scent, and dough textures; the studio’s atmosphere—bridging decay and wonder—enhances the thematic tension between mechanization and tradition more effectively than any expository dialogue.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors ("dough bleeding colors like watercolors") and layered themes elevate the story; the ending feels inevitable yet resonant, though the conflict’s resolution leans on abstract rebellion rather than concrete stakes to deepen emotional impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through precise, unexpected details (e.g., "cookies as rebellion") and resists overwrought prose; tone remains cohesive despite moments of near-lyrical excess, and the concept of "disappearing ink" as both poetic device and plot mechanism feels distinctly human-authored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements feel purposefully woven rather than perfunctorily assigned, but the economy of the form occasionally sacrifices thematic resolution; the closing image of "jasmine and revolution" lingers powerfully, suggesting latent narrative depth within constraints.</comment>
