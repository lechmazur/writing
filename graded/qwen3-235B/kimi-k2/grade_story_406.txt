<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Finch’s motivation of atonement is clear, and his remorse is effectively shown through actions (e.g., the loose button). However, secondary characters like Rowan lack depth beyond their narrative function, and Finch’s backstory as a spy feels underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The reversed time mechanism efficiently drives the plot, and the tight narrative arc (porch beginning/end) is satisfying. Pacing is near-flawless, though the leap to Finch’s post-redemption life feels abrupt despite the brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, original sensory details (e.g., “steam curled like borrowed valor”) create a haunting atmosphere. The setting’s magical realism complements the tone, though the witch’s potion brewery teeters on fantasy trope but is saved by precise imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors (valor/forgiveness/identity) and subtext elevate the narrative. The ending’s emotional resonance—Finch’s anonymity versus Rowan’s redemption—achieves profound thematic complexity, with sparse but impactful prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality lies in subverting time-travel clichés via emotional stakes and ethical costs. No purple prose; motifs are fresh. Sentiments like remorse are shown, not told, avoiding AI-generated pitfalls. Rare nuance in emotional logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Elements are fused organically: the witch’s potion enables the redemption arc, the loose button symbolizes guilt, and reversed time underscores the cost of lies. The resonant ending invites reflection on identity and penance.</comment>
