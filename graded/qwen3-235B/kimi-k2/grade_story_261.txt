<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character is evocative but her immortality occasionally strains credibility; motivations are clear but the emotional depth of her relationship with her daughter feels slightly underexplored</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured but the leap from ink patterns to equations for ecological repair lacks detailed scientific plausibility within the narrative logic</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is exceptional with vivid, cohesive fusion of sci-fi and ecological collapse, though the sheer density of concepts occasionally overwhelms immersion</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful use of symbolism (e.g., backward-growth trees) and subtext about environmental hubris, though the ending veers slightly towards sentimentality</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elegantly avoids clich√©s with unique metaphors (ink galaxies as equations), though the phrase "accelerated peaches" risks tonal dissonance with the otherwise poetic prose</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Excellent thematic coherence with strong emotional resonance; some concepts (quantum apple trees, ink equations) demand more unpacking than the format allows</comment>
