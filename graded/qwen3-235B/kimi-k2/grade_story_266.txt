<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is richly symbolic but lacks interiority; motivations are implied through surreal actions rather than psychological complexity. The clown's pain is evoked but emotional journey remains abstract.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Structured like a poem rather than a prose narrative; plot progression is intuitive rather than causally linked. The looping Möbius imagery creates circularity rather than forward motion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phosphorescent skin and quartz-crystal acoustics create immersive, multisensory unreality. Every detail serves the metaphysical tone, though the floating rock defies narrative weight despite vivid description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Linguistic virtuosity and existential subtext linger long after reading. The clown's self-evisceration as teaching method juxtaposes vulnerability and performance with haunting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Some striking metaphors (“dark theater with one dim bulb”) but risks purple prose with “translucent kites of promises.” Avoids tropes through surrealism yet occasionally substitutes strangeness for substance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherence exists through motif repetition (light/darkness, floating/grounding) rather than traditional plotting. The poetic unity outweighs fragmented literal logic in this experimental form.</comment>
