<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character defined by obsessive pursuit but lacks emotional depth; motivations feel archetypal. Internal conflict remains surface-level despite the transformative conclusion.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a clear arc but relies on surreal leaps rather than organic cause-effect. Ending satisfies mystique but risks feeling contrived under scrutiny.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (marble, myrrh, silk) create a hauntingly immersive atmosphere. Setting transcends mood pieces to subtly support thematic weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic structures but contains ornate descriptors that occasionally feel derivative. The twist subverts expectations, though emotional resonance relies heavily on imagery over nuanced psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified mythic tone. The ending provokes unease but sacrifices accessibility for poetic abstraction, reducing visceral impact.</comment>
