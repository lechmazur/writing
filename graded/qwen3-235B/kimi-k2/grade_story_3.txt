<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's surliness and desire to understand cosmic patterns are distinct but underdeveloped; his abrupt transformation from guardian to cosmic interpreter lacks sufficient emotional scaffolding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear time structure with seven-day progression creates compelling momentum; however, the resolution via tidal shell patterns feels slightly teleological without deeper causal logic connecting it to Garrick's actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory-rich maritime necropolis setting achieves immersive uncanniness through specific details like "wind chimes of broken rigging" and "grief became compass"; atmosphere becomes active participant rather than passive backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphorical density succeeds through tactile symbolism (yarn/bracelet/tide) and existential metaphors (universe as market), with ending delivering philosophical resonance through concrete imagery rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical minimalism avoids most formulaic traps; "calcifying heart" and "frayed things hold memory" demonstrate originality while maintaining emotional truth rather than sentimentalism; occasional phrase ("cosmic fingerprint") risks preciousness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements interlock into thematic mosaic rather than checklist; poetic compression within brief length feels intentional; the final image of "keeper and keeper-of" creates existential circularity without closure, inviting contemplation.</comment>
