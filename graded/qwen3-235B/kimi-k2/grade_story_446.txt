<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but under-explored; "peaceful anger" and "unbecoming" are evocatively named but lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progresses methodically but feels slightly predictable; cause-effect between memories dissolving and kingdom restoration is abstract, lacking narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (fireflies, ledger’s smell) create immersion, though the timeframe ("between charity drives") remains under-integrated with theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (hydrolysis, reeds, fireflies) are elegant, but emotional resonance relies on poetic language over visceral character transformation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose avoids cliché but borders on overwritten ("green sparks" for fireflies); subtext is present but occasionally undermined by explicit thematics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Elements cohere aesthetically but lack narrative urgency; the theme of relinquishment is clear, though emotional payoff feels reserved.</comment>
