<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (hunger for "raw edge") are clear but remain largely surface-level; the protagonist's duality as digital influencer and occult figure isn't fully explored. The "indifferent enthusiasm" attribute is well-depicted but doesn't evolve into complex behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a coherent journey from receipt discovery to ritual ignition, but the transition between locations (music hall to mess hall) feels abrupt. The resolution via communal dream-burning is evocative but lacks narrative weight - the tightly constrained word count sacrifices some causal clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory construction of liminal spaces - mildew, metallic snow, ramen-tarot altars - creates haunting atmosphere. However, the timeframe ("after final chord") disconnects from setting; the mess hall's wartime origins and digital-age haunt feel tonally mismatched but not purposefully so.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Potent imagery (followers as moths "made of static," "quietly loud" tone) elevates thematic tension between virtual/real existence. The ending evokes ritualistic release but plays as stylistic flourish rather than earned emotional catharsis; subtext about performance vs. authenticity remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines through inventive combinations (scented candle sponsors, nightmare vinyl traders) rather than strict subversion. Avoids horror tropes - the exorcism becomes collective dream-burning. Slight purple prose ("metallic snow") but mostly restrained; emotional resonance emerges through specific, non-formulaic details.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The elements create an immersive fever-dream, but their cohesion feels accidental rather than architecturally intentional. The music hall timeframe and wartime mess hall aren't meaningfully connected. The brevity allows focus on atmosphere over plot, though thematic unity suffers slightly.</comment>
