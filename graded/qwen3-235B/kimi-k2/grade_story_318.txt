<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's aloofness influences isolation but lacks nuanced exploration; motivations (guilt/redemption) and reactions (emotional collapse at spoon's whisper) align with traits but lack depth beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Linear progression from hesitance to resolve exists, but compressed pacing leaves the final stand underdeveloped; cause-effect (lullaby's translation triggering transformation) is logical but rushed in execution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, immersive setting; "damp wool" atmosphere and refracted childhoods create haunting beauty; fusion of mind-architecture and crystal decay meaningfully mirrors character's fractured psyche and external conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("hollows of ribs as resonators") and symbolic action elevate thematic weight; ending resonates with paradoxical hope in defeat; emotional impact emerges through sensory subtext rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original integration of unconventional elements (wooden spoon as translator, mind-architecture); avoids clich√© but occasionally tips into ornate abstraction ("phantom sweetness of milk"); emotional subtext (guilt, fragile resolve) feels genuine despite abstract framing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Elements cohere into poignant narrative but stretch believability in places; the 500-word constraint sacrifices some character depth; conceptually ambitious with lingering resonance but requires editorial polish for top-tier standards.</comment>
