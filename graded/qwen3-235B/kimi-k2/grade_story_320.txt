<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are emotionally resonant but lack sufficient psychological depth; transformation feels abrupt despite strong symbolic anchoring in photographs. Voice remains evocatively subdued yet occasionally insufficiently differentiated from narrative prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot structure maintains coherence through photographic catalysts and timeline bleed, but social media element disrupts mythic tone slightly; pacing balances compression with thematic payoff, though cosmic rebalancing feels under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Underwater market’s bioluminescent decay creates visceral immersion; tactile details like curling photographs and octopus vocalizations forge atmospheric unity; settings across timelines intertwine elegantly with character’s psychic landscape.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (regret as tide, captions as temporal breadcrumbs) achieve poetic precision; theme of active choice over passive fate resonates through layered imagery; resolution feels emotionally earned despite cosmic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Phrasing occasionally risks florid abstraction (“ink in water” for timeline blending), but most metaphors remain original; emotional nuance emerges through symbolic action rather than exposition; social media element walks line between innovative and incongruous.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Element synthesis prioritizes thematic cohesion over strict genre logic; social media device creates productive tension rather than undermining the premise; leaves lingering questions about agency across temporal scales.</comment>
