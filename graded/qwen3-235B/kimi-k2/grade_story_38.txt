<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's motivation is consistent, with poetic voice and internal conflict effectively shown through symbolism and dialogue; transformation feels earned but lacks deeper exploration of psychological tensions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot has coherent arc and thematic resolution, but pacing relies heavily on poetic abstraction over concrete narrative progression; transitions between 'subway stops' risk disjointedness in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are immaculately rendered with sensory precision; haunted attic and moonlight amplify character's introspection, while botanical samples root the tone in visceral tension between decay and healing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors are layered and evocative (e.g., "poisons as teachers"), with a resonant theme of choice over elimination; subtext of academic theft-as-rebellion is subtle but impactful within limited space.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging botanical duality with non-violence philosophy; avoids overt clich√©s, but some phrasing ("subway stops of memory") skirts abstract vagueness rather than fully subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified, thematically rich narrative; the brevity enhances poetic impact, with the haunting-to-transcendence arc feeling purposeful rather than constrained.</comment>
