<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinctive 'voice' in indirect narration reveals layered motives (e.g., 'fragile and sharp-edged' promise), but backstory compression prevents deeper character evolution despite consistent secrecy and hidden agenda alignment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Twist-driven arc (tech-revelation through kiss) executes within constraints, but pacing unevenly stretches worldbuilding while compressing emotional payoff; cause-effect (doodles → dust → truth) feels metaphysically plausible but structurally abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory alchemy (cardamom/cardboard/cardamom) creates immersive atmosphere, though some details (bioluminescent dust) verge on fantastical overload; 'aviary as engine' concept powerfully unifies setting with theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphor-rich prose (flower/seed, doodles/wings) creates thematic resonance; 'undying creativity' manifests through tangible imagery rather than abstraction; tension between secrecy and revelation provides narrative backbone with lingering philosophical punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Occasional sensory overload ('storm of ink and starlight') treads toward purple prose, but overall style serves substance through consistent symbolic logic; avoids genre tropes while delivering surprising avian-futurism; emotional stakes shown through tactile interactions (touching pages, cracking spine) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Complex interweaving of constraints creates thematic unity (e.g., crayon-as-blueprint's multiple functions), though time compression strains plausibility; closing image (birds as data-messengers) crystallizes concept-into-metaphor with publishable economy.</comment>
