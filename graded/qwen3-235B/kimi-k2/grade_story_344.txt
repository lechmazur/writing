<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are nuanced and closely tied to actions; the interplay between Mara's claustrophobia, her research-driven curiosity, and her vulnerable transformation feels organic. Minor quibble: Lin's role as "lightly heavyhearted" could be more deeply differentiated from Mara's arc.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot flows with quiet momentum, using the jam tasting, tremors, and tactile exchanges to drive subtle character and thematic shifts. The compressed word count requires some elliptical storytelling, but the connection between Mara's fear and her final resolve remains emotionally persuasive and structurally cohesive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Dazzling, immersive sensory details (lanterns as jellyfish, groaning rock) anchor the floating tea house's precarious beauty. The setting’s claustrophobic pressures and fragile elegance mirror Mara’s internal state, creating a seamless link between atmosphere and character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (fear as a compass, warmth as ballast) and layered subtext (studying humanity by becoming a "datum") elevate the narrative. The ending avoids sentimentality, using tactile gestures to convey emotional revelation with memorable subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of subaquatic grit and fragile rituals. Avoids clichés (e.g., healing without magic, trauma as sensory memory). Minor lapses: "glacier water" tea borders on overprecision; otherwise, language balances poetic specificity with emotional restraint.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements serve theme and character, with no extraneous details. The brevity amplifies tension and emotional stakes. Leaves readers contemplating vulnerability as courage, making the tight structure feel purposeful rather than constrained.</comment>
