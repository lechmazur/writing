<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character lacks nuanced psychology; motivations are clear but not fully earned through action. The aristocrat's desperation and eventual redemption feel somewhat underdeveloped within the strict word limit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot maintains structural coherence but some transitions (e.g., sudden distillation process) lack sufficient groundwork. The arc is complete but feels compressed, sacrificing potential depth for lyrical brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through synesthetic details - rusted gates, metallic-tasting sap, absinthe laughter. Setting actively shapes the narrative rather than simply containing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hauntingly poetic. The subversion of inherited wealth as "burden" evolving to "wings" offers philosophical weight. Final image of teaching "secret recipes" to wanderers provides satisfyingly ambiguous resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some phrases ("harmonizing breathing with creaking metal") border on Gothic clich√©, the fusion of botanical horror with aristocratic decay feels fresh. Emotional subtext is primarily shown rather than told, avoiding common AI-writing pitfalls.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All required elements are present and mostly purposeful, though timeframe's "parallel paths" serve more as metaphor than narrative engine. The self-contained world of decayed grandeur feels organic rather than checklist-driven.</comment>
