<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly from "transgression" to redemption without sufficient psychological groundwork; the transformation feels intellectually coherent rather than emotionally inevitable. The profession of cybernetic veterinarian remains superficially connected to her forbidden desire for organic memory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a circular arc (bucket as weapon vs. sanctuary) with elegant economy, but some plot pivots (optical ribbon overload, memory gland’s invitation) lack mechanical or thematic foreshadowing. Pacing stumbles slightly toward climax’s conceptual weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Richly textured setting with visceral sensory contrasts (bioluminescent decay vs. plastic-littered bleaching), though the reef-city’s techno-organic synthesis occasionally veers into cluttered symbolism. Motel intrusion feels narratively essential but spatially disorienting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphoric duality—cybernetic healing/hunting, memory as sanctuary/taboo. Ending’s emotional resonance emerges organically from imagery rather than exposition, though some metaphors risk overdense abstraction threatening accessibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Few clichés; sensory details avoid AI patterning (e.g. “plastic drift” vs. “starfish drone” contrast). Some phrases (“dying angelfish”, “chilled nanoserum like captive moonlight”) border on aestheticized abstraction rather than earned metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elaborate tapestry of interconnected elements occasionally strains believability, but theme of perception’s cost permeates all aspects. Compact length feels deliberate, though certain emotional beats (overload sequence) could use broader breathing space.</comment>
