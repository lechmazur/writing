<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character traits like "faithfully odd" and grief-driven resolve are established, but internal conflicts remain abstract, partially relying on poetic description over psychological depth to convey connection between his sister's memory and his crusade against stagnation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but the connection between the train whistle's symbolic role and the mechanical resolution feels metaphorically satisfying without clear physical/logical causality, creating a suspension of disbelief challenge.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (burnished copper tang, sawdust-motes-as-comets) create immersive atmosphere where every gear and sticker breathes narrative, though steampunk technology's functionality remains aesthetic rather than plot-essential.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (gods of stagnation as "jointed shadows") and haunting imagery elevate, but explicit statements of theme undercut subtext. Ending's emotional resonance is genuine yet undercut by overly familiar "courage to keep moving" platitudes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Many phrases ("placid ferocity," "laughter without mouths") demonstrate stylistic daring, but abstractions like "innocence reborn as courage" verge on cliché. Originality shines in mechanical poetry but wavers under literary pretensions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story transcends collection of elements by intertwining them into thematic engine—the skateboard as both relic and catalyst makes every assigned piece feel necessary despite slight tonal unevenness in emotional passages.</comment>
