<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Poor character definition; more symbolic device than fully realized person. Motivation is present but abstract, lacking psychological depth. Reactions to cards/seed breeding lack emotional texture, reducing complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Plot exists as poetic sequence rather than structured narrative. Connection between elements feels loose, resolution is atmospheric rather than earned. Pacing prioritizes mood over narrative causality, leaving arc underdeveloped for the confined form.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Superb atmospheric construction through dense, original imagery (torn silk sky, translucent whales). Sensory immersion elevates setting, though 'ethereal plains' occasionally veer into vagueness rather than specific invention.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Skillful use of poetic symbolism (song as door, cards as silent authority) creates layered meaning. Ending resonates thematically. Some overwritten prose and underdeveloped conflict limit maximum impact despite strong craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking originality in combining postwar decay with botanical hope. Metaphors feel fresh, emotional resonance earned through subtext rather than declaration. Maintains stylistic unity without lapsing into purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>Elements cohere thematically but occasionally overshadow narrative momentum. Stylistic choices enhance rather than hinder, though brevity sacrifices full emotional payoff. Leaves contemplative impression without feeling rushed.</grade>
