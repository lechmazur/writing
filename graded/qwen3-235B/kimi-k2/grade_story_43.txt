<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Minimal direct insight into the protagonist's interiority despite vivid actions; some traits remain symbolic rather than psychologically complex. Strength lies in atmosphere-as-character reflection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Nonlinear structure prioritizes poetic progression over cause-effect chain; pacing manages to feel deliberate despite limited plot movement. Resolution feels earned through imagery rather than narrative conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Viridian haze of decaying neon, the slickness of condensation on spiral stairs, and bioluminescent scripture create immersive synesthetic world-building that directly shapes both plot and character choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors compound rather than repeat; the alchemy of imperfection as courage achieves thematic weight through tactile details rather than abstract statements. Transcendent yet grounded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through surreal juxtaposition (saints as software, courage as scratched media), but occasional adjectival density (e.g., "portable cathedral of crooked hope") veers toward self-indulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements function synergistically rather than cumulatively; brevity serves the evocation of existential aftermath rather than feels artificially constrained.</comment>
