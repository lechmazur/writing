<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tailor's motivations (fear of completion, desire for transcendence) are poetically articulated but lack grounding in concrete actions. While his profession informs symbolic gestures, the philosophical weight feels more conceptual than organically earned through lived behavior or contextual history.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story maintains momentum through vivid set pieces, but the transition from confession to transcendence relies on poetic abstraction rather than narrative logic. The ending creates closure through thematic symmetry but leaves the mechanics of his transformation ambiguous in ways that slightly undermine coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The steampunk setting provides tactile grit (grinding gears, ozone smells) while the molten mirror offers visual grandeur. Atmospheric details like 'clockwork dust' and 'threads of light' connect mechanics to metaphor, though some descriptions verge on overwrought without crossing into full excess.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (thread as self-destruction/creation) and the existential dilemma create resonance. The final revelation about becoming 'the seam between lives' introduces satisfying thematic closure, though some dialogue leans toward aphoristic proclamations rather than psychologically nuanced expression.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The steampunk framework and parallel worlds trope risk feeling familiar, yet the twist of identity-as-craftsmanship adds originality. Occasional overuse of ornamental phrasing ('echo that reassures every frightened reflection') and slightly formulaic metaphors (storms demanding confessions) temper the otherwise innovative central conceit.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><comment>The story displays ambitious thematic scaffolding and striking imagery, but remains poised between mythic resonance and self-indulgent abstraction. Some elements serve the narrative while others feel artistically performative; the brevity both concentrates effect and restricts emotional stakes.</comment>
