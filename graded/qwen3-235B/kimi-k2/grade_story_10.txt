<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits (pride, vengeance) drive the narrative, but his abrupt psychological shift feels insufficiently grounded despite potent imagery.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Narrative flows logically from entry to transformation, though the brevity strains the emotional arc's plausibility, making key moments feel truncated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensorily immersive with its metallic decay and surreal alchemy, though the spaceport's technological elements lack concrete connection to the ritualistic core.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Virtually no formulaic elements; metaphors ("kettle and bent spoon") avoid abstraction, emotions shown through tactile transformation rather than stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Elements combine inventively with occasional friction; the spaceport's relevance feels secondary to the chamber-like intimacy of the chest's revelation.</comment>
