<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's mild temperament lacks direct expression beyond passive resistance; motivation is clear but emotional depth remains intellectual rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compact structure with cause-effect logic, but the rapid escalation from anvil discovery to escape feels slightly rushed despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ominous, dreamlike atmosphere with vivid details (neon alleys, Möbius strip thrusters) that deepen thematic resonance and disorientation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (thread, anvil) and subversion of hero/villain tropes create potent subtext; ending’s "third thing" lingers ambiguously.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés but has moments of overly ornate phrasing ("purred in harmonics that bent spacetime") that flirt with excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements like the anvil and disguise are intrinsic; the black hole resort’s surrealism integrates most constraints, though "poetically bland" feels inconsistently applied.</comment>
