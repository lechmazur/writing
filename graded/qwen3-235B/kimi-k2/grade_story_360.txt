<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's "meekness" remains superficial - her actions (solving the riddle, defying vanishing scholars) contradict her stated timidity. Motivation to "decode a universal riddle" lacks emotional grounding beyond the backstory plague reference. Her reaction to the dew droplet insight feels passive rather than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Plot progression relies on mystical conveniences (dew-light revelation, benevolent thread stitching) rather than internal logic. Cause-effect between "regain" and tapestry unraveling strains plausibility. Pacing alternates between lush set-pieces and abrupt scholar-rescue resolution that undermines build-up.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Goblin playground atmosphere falters under scrutiny - marbles/clattering sounds clash with subsequent marble-memory stasis. Light sources (moss vs. starlight vs. pen-lantern) create visual dissonance. Sensory details privilege visual poetry over functional worldbuilding (ex: how does a "basalt court" shape goblin culture?).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphor resonance ("memory needle/light knot") elevates thematic cohesion. The ending's emotional impact stems from subverting riddle conventions toward collective resurrection. Occasional lyrical passages (ink from moon-moth wings) deepen tone, though some imagery borders on preciousness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overuse of hyphenated modifiers ("moss-lit Hall of Echoes," "dew-lit pen") risks aesthetic uniformity. Tapestry-shifting scholars echo common fantasy liminal-space tropes without reinvention. Elara's "meek heart" transformation lacks concrete dramatization. Some sensory details (stone lily breath) feel conceptually borrowed rather than organically observed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Formal cohesion struggles between fairy-tale lyricism and its puzzle-box plot mechanics. The 400-word scope serves poetic moments better than narrative complexity. While the final metaphor threading love/memory/light lingers, character arcs remain secondary to atmospheric achievements.</comment>
