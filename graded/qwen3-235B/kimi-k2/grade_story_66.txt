<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear and consistent with his actions (e.g., using masks to apologize), but lacks deeper psychological nuance. Voice is distinct yet overly poetic to the point of abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through cyclical seasons and evolving plant interactions, with mirror and masks shaping structure. Arc from guilt to redemption is coherent but rushed in its emotional progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plant communication study setting is evocative, with rich sensory details (e.g., "scent of loam"), but the "deserter" and "greenhouse" clash subtly in historical/logic terms. Atmosphere prioritizes emotional resonance over strict realism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "green handshake") and recurring motifs (masks, mirrors) create layered meaning. Ending ties theme of renewal to subtext; dialogue (sparse) and tone amplify the lyrical gravity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.9</grade><comment>Phrasing avoids clichés despite poetic density; plant agency feels fresh. Emotional resonance is shown through tactile interactions (tendrils, compost), not told. No mechanical repetition; style is idiosyncratic but not overwrought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story balances assigned elements cohesively; each enhances atmosphere or theme (e.g., mirrors as fractured identity). Some elements (e.g., "dizzyingly grounded") feel forced but mostly integrate. Lingering questions about redemption satisfy.</comment>
