<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cleanly sketched but underdeveloped; noble status informs superficial choices, not inner conflict. Motivation feels imposed rather than organic to psychological stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Driven by tightly coiled imagery but strained by brevity—narrative arc compressed into symbolic gestures at expense of emotional gravitas.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rich tactile surfaces (burning stubs, cooling rotors) clash with underexplained contradictions—a noble’s lab existence, "thermal ghosts" unmoored from logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Profound thematic resonance in "truth through ruin," but emotional heft undercut by reliance on abstractions over embodied conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative core ideas undercut by occasional baroque flourishes ("hollow recklessness hummed louder") and uneven tonal control.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Polished formal architecture masks precarious balance—elements like drone/confession function but strain suspension of disbelief.</comment>
