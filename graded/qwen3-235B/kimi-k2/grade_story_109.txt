<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's coldnaturedness is shown through actions, but motivations shift from 'mercy rebellion' to artistic awakening without full psychological nuance. Voice remains consistent, yet transformation feels slightly abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Focused 'build altars' action drives plot effectively. Pacing is tight but maintains coherence, though the progression from herbal mission to artistic rebellion lacks explicit connection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between sterile surveillance elements and candlelit altars enhance tone. The plague-riddled urban night creates atmospheric urgency without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Knitting metaphors and altar symbolism create haunting subtext about mending society. Subverts cold knight tropes to explore rebellion via small acts, with ending's warmth feeling earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through specific imagery (heartsease altars, 'monochrome battlefields'). Some formal phrases ('whispering cloak') border on archaic ornamentation without breaking immersion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synthesis of knightly duty and subversive art feels original. Blending plague imagery with surveillance state elements creates thematic cohesion, though secret agent center's purpose remains partially ambiguous.</comment>
