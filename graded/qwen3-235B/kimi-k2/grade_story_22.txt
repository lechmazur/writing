<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivations feel surface-level; "perfectly flawed" informs actions but lacks psychological depth; reliance on poetic abstraction over concrete emotional development weakens investment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pacing is ambitious but uneven—shifts from dismantling portals to domestic visions feel abrupt; plot hinges on magical logic that's inconsistently explained; arc is complete but strained by constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is lush and cohesive in a mythic register; sensory details (smoke, cinnamon, rustling stone feathers) immerse effectively; some elements (library radiator vision) strain tonal unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphor-laden prose elevates thematic resonance (legacy, memory, grace); ending lingers with haunting interplay of irony and sincerity; emotional beats are implied rather than deeply felt.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original mythopoeic framework avoids clichés, but risks overwritten phrases ("grace seed[ing] her tongue with stories") undercut subtlety; character logic remains humanly illogical, not formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Coherence achieved through lyrical throughlines despite element-heavy brief; style occasionally overwhelms thematic clarity, but narrative compression feels intentional rather than compromised.</grade>
