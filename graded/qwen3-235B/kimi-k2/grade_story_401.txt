<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation for reconciliation are clear, with the ring and blanket effectively anchoring her emotional arc. However, her background as a wilderness guide feels underexplored in shaping her psyche, and her "guiltily innocent" trait lacks nuanced psychological depth beyond established beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a ritualistic structure with clear beginning (diving) and end (ascent), but the middle relies heavily on expository revelations from the blanket. Pacing feels compressed, and the symbolic resolution risks feeling overly tidy despite strong imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hauntingly evoked with chandeliers-as-kelp metaphors, silt-rippled floors, and thermos vs. salt-logged wool contrasts. Sensory details create an eerie, immersive atmosphere that perfectly mirrors emotional states, particularly in the coffee-as-ghost and blanket-warming scenes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose dazzles with fresh metaphors ("pearled breath," "kelp crowns") and symbolic layering, but some emotional beats rely on established poetic cadences rather than raw revelation. The ending's balance-as-reconciliation theme resonates, though "staying open" feels slightly glib after such textured immersion.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in encoded diary-blanket concept and guilt/redemption-as-diving parallels. Avoids clich√©s with specific details (barnacle braille, thermos ritual), but the sister's underwater crochet project strains credulity. Lyrical voice feels human but occasionally leans too heavily on atmospheric embellishment over thematic urgency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Highly cohesive despite dense element-list. The ring, coffee, and blanket are tightly interwoven, creating emotional resonance through symbolic logic. However, some elements (e.g., morning coffee timeframe) serve atmosphere better than plot momentum, and the ending prioritizes poetic closure over lingering ambiguity.</comment>
