<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Her confusion anchors the character, but motivation (policy-to-prayer shift) feels somewhat abstract; emotional depth relies too heavily on symbolism over human complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Plot flows fluidly through descent/epiphany/ascent arc; pacing is taut yet never rushed, with cause/effect between imagery and action (salt, birds, key) tightly maintained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting is sensorially rich but underexploits the salt mine’s potential; the eerie atmosphere contrasts with its communal vibrancy, leaving some atmospheric threads unresolved.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stylistic precision and poetic metaphors (e.g., “sky as a blue wound”) enhance thematic resonance; the ending resonates with layered subtext about memory and liberation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids cliché with fresh metaphors and nuanced tone (“boldly timid”); leans heavily on lyrical abstraction but maintains emotional resonance through concrete imagery (salt, wings, brine).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified meditation on survival through memory; the story’s brevity amplifies its themes rather than constraining them.</comment>
