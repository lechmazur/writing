<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is atmospheric but lacks emotional depth; motivations hinted through abstract actions rather than concrete internal logic or relatable psychology.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a cyclical, symbolic progression with lyrical momentum but lacks tangible stakes or clear resolution; poetic abstraction risks overshadowing narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Majestic atmosphere sustained through precise, synesthetic details that fuse with thematic elements; setting functions as both environment and emotional register.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking imagery and symbolic resonance elevate the work, though emotional impact is diffuse; the spiral motif and musical metaphors suggest but don't fully crystallize thematic meaning.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through inventive metaphors and surreal logic, but the ornate prose occasionally verges on self-indulgent; emotional nuance remains elusive despite rich texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Holds together as a fragmentary tone poem with cohesive motifs, but its ambition to balance lyrical abstraction with narrative momentum is unevenly achieved.</comment>
