<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Orchardist’s motivation is poetically stated but emotionally opaque; his actions serve plot mechanics more than psychological realism, though the final sacrifice’s quiet tragedy lingers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited word count compresses narrative arc, but the prophecy payoff and symbolic rebirth of the cherry tree provide structural cohesion despite slight pacing unevenness in mid-scene transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (e.g., “moonlight tasted of rust”) and the eerie juxtaposition of organic decay and sterile technology create a haunting, genre-blurring atmosphere of existential longing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (sound as smoke, silence as containment) layer profound themes of loss and artistry; the ending’s tragic irony resonates as a meditation on artistic martyrdom and memory’s fragility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, controlled prose avoids cliché (e.g., “blossoms chiming like bells”); avoids AI’s tendency toward generic phrasing but occasionally lapses into density that occludes emotional clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements fuse into a cohesive mythopoeic narrative; the brevity sharpens its elegiac focus but leaves underdeveloped the societal context of “black-market memory,” which could deepen the theme.</comment>
