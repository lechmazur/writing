<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict and growth through self-acceptance are clear, but motivations could be more concretely dramatized. Voice blends poetic introspection with mechanical elements, occasionally sacrificing emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral plot progression driven by metaphors rather than action. Strong thematic throughline but lacks concrete stakes. Pacing effectively contemplative but occasionally diffuse. Cause-effect logic operates on symbolic rather than narrative levels.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisitely tactile worldbuilding with unique details like bioluminescent pears, forgiveness-tasting light, and affectionate vines. Sensory language immerses reader while reinforcing themes. Timeframe motif weaves cohesively through migration imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Metaphoric density creates emotional resonance. Subtext about internalized shame as fertilizer for growth is compelling. Ending balances resolution with poetic ambiguity. Occasional overreliance on abstract aphorisms risks emotional distance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("rot you stop fighting," "fruit bearing subtle tang of self-acceptance") elevate above clich√©. Some phrases verge on ornate (e.g., "fruit-heavy boughs bending under starlight and regret"). Emotional depth emerges through symbols rather than stated feelings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Thematic cohesion from lost-to-becoming arc. Elements interlock thematically but narrative structure leans heavily on poetic cohesion over traditional plotting. Length feels intrinsic to its ephemeral style, though certain transitions strain believability.</comment>
