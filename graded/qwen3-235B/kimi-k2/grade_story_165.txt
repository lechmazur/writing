<question>1</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara's "gentle" traits manifest superficially through actions ("trembling fingers") but lack psychological depth; motivation (rebuilding the garden) drives plot but isn't interrogated emotionally; reactions to objects feel archetypal rather than human; first-person narration could have sharpened voice but was absent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pivotal actions (reassembling butterfly, reversing messages) rely on montage-like brevity; pacing falters during exposition-heavy descent; thematic cause-effect (justice restored via fragmented truth) is resonant but execution feels compressed; abrupt resolution undermines emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually immersive with striking tactile contrasts (velvet vs. obsidian) and synesthetic details (mercury fountains); setting-as-character effect works particularly through dwarven artifacts mirroring moral decay; slight tonal dissonance between "joyful terror" and relentlessly somber imagery; atmosphere occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over narrative necessity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Reversed messages and fractured justice operate as potent metaphors but lack narrative subtext; theme of reconstructed truth resonates, yet emotional beats (weeping at conclusion) feel assigned rather than earned; lyrical prose elevates impact but overuses similes; "showing" through environment excels, but character interiority falls short.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rarely descends into outright cliché, but archetypal fantasy elements (enchanted objects, underground realms) strain originality; "petrified roses," "molten gold waterfalls" verge on clichéd splendor; some fresh inversions (justice as reversible process) but uneven execution; metaphors rich yet inconsistent in emotional weight; overall style memorable but overwrites at times.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through recurring symbolic throughlines (shard → truth → restoration) but feels conceptually safer than premise suggests; element integration mostly purposeful but occasionally perfunctory (e.g., brittle branch framing device underdeveloped); thematic depth hinted but constrained by word limit; linguistic richness surpasses structural ambition.</comment>
