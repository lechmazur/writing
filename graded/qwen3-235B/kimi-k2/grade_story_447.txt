<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Characterization of Lila Mae is richly layered through her actions and relationship to the stuffed ear, though secondary characters remain underdeveloped. Motivations are clear but could benefit from more interiority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot structures itself around the prophecy-unraveling method, but the transition from isolation to communal healing risks underdevelopment within the tight frame, especially the town's sudden response.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Sensory details (rosemary, unraveling threads, amber walls) create a haunting, immersive atmosphere. The diner-turned-prison serves as a potent metaphor for frozen time, though its origins remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (bulletins as edible prophecies, rebellion as culinary subversion) elevate the narrative. The ending’s quiet hope resonates thematically, though the tonal shift from isolation to connection could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in the stuffed ear’s prophetic function and cooking-as-rebellion, but occasional over-reliance on amber/silk metaphors veers toward ornamental abstraction. Emotions are shown but occasionally tempered by familiar cadences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story cohesively synthesizes elements into a self-contained parable. Subtle thematic throughlines (prophecy vs. agency) resonate, though some conceptual beats (e.g., diner’s transformation) could be more explicitly earned.</comment>
