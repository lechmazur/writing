<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are poetic but underexplored; "euphoric agitation" lacks psychological nuance beyond surface behavior. Vows and storm metaphor imply depth but aren't grounded in specific desires or contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Abstract plot cohesion exists—prism/light transformation provides structure—but progression from kneeling to dissolution feels rushed. Internal logic of the storm as "memory" rather than destruction strains coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through sensory contradictions (digital ghosts vs. leather), but the blending of cybernetic and mythological elements occasionally creates tonal whiplash rather than synergy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose achieves poetic unity through recurring refracted light/safety motifs. Subtext about spirituality in technology feels profound without being didactic. Ending crystallizes theme with electric immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avant-garde metaphors ("prayers written in static") subvert genre tropes, but repetitive sentence structures and occasional phrase recycling ("patiently frantic," "euphoric agitation") suggest algorithmic cadence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion survives tight integration of required elements, but the skeletal framework of a longer story remains visible beneath lyrical veneer.</comment>
