<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to create an enduring masterpiece is clear, but his internal conflict and emotional depth remain underexplored despite poetic imagery. His actions (e.g., carving names) align with his quest for legacy, but his transformation into a "guardian of unfinished symphonies" lacks psychological nuance beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot follows a mythic arc (searching for relics, raising the palace, creating the mosaic) that's coherent but compressed. The cause-effect chain (shard → relics → whale → constellation) feels logically consistent, but the rapid shifts between surreal transformations occasionally strain credibility within the tight word limit, diluting the emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visually lush and immersive: the cursed lake, jade-and-obsidian palace, and whale-constellation all create a haunting, mythic atmosphere. Sensory details (taste of copper, binary-singing fish) deepen the uncanny mood. The setting isn't just backdrop—it actively responds to Arin's actions, blending mood and plot effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor (e.g., "ache that makes future skaters pause," scuff marks as "stories older than glaciers") and symbolic architecture. The ending resonates with melancholy transcendence: legacy as collective participation, not individual triumph. The theme of art as a living dialogue between past and present is both profound and subtly dramatized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Few clichés, but some phrases ("drowned centuries," "whale made of circuitry") flirt with overfamiliarity. The scholar-savior trope is slightly predictable, though subverted by making Arin's masterpiece an ongoing process. Subtleties of grief and time feel lived-in, but the hyper-poetic description risks occasional detachment from emotional immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Creative fusion of science-fantasy and elegiac lyricism. The story demands emotional engagement with its metaphysics of memory, but some fantastical leaps (e.g., lake draining into sky) lean on stylistic momentum rather than narrative logic. The brevity feels intentional, but the weighty themes occasionally outpace the space.</comment>
