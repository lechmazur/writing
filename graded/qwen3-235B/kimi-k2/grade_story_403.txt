<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Characterization is atmospheric rather than psychological; motivations are implied through poetic abstraction but lack concrete emotional grounding or nuanced evolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of discovery and transcendence, but the rapid shift into surrealism risks collapsing structure into metaphor, sacrificing narrative tension for lyrical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are vividly immersive, but the density of surreal imagery occasionally obscures the physical logic of how characters might "physically" interact with spaces.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative symbolism and resonant ending elevate the story, though some themes arrive telegraphed rather than organically revealed through action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Daringly original in imagery and metaphor, but occasionally falters into ornate abstraction; emotional resonance relies more on cumulative atmosphere than grounded subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong poetic cohesion across elements, though the final impression leans toward polished concept over character-driven emotional urgency required for top-tier distinction.</comment>
