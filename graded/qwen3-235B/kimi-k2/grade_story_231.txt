<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Enlil’s spontaneity and sentimentalism drive key decisions, but his motivation (paying justice through sacrifice) feels abruptly resolved without deeper psychological exploration; his dialogue reveals character but leans on archetypal phrasing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic arc with cause-effect clarity (coordinates → labyrinth → scale), but pacing falters slightly in the throne room transition; the ending ties to the beginning but leaves some episodic gaps in the palace’s symbolic geography.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Sumerian palace’s decay and celestial imagery create visceral atmosphere; sensory details (lapis dust, bleating sheep) immerse readers effectively. Coordinate-chased quests and spectral judges align thematically, avoiding historical flatness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (justice-as-hunger, memory-as-anchor) and recursive imagery (sprig/hairpin) enrich subtext; ending’s thematic clarity (“chaos teaches when we admit we’re small”) lingers. Conflict between sacrifice/ethics stays resonant despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stylistic flourishes (e.g., “star-drunk sky”) occasionally veer toward extravagance, but the mytho-poetic tone avoids machine-generated clichés; emotional beats (“tears watering earth”) lean on symbol rather than explicit telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive fusion of pastoral and legal metaphors; brevity amplifies the story’s mythic tone. The thematic core—that justice demands sacrifice but also self-awareness—is conveyed with stylistic singularity.</comment>
