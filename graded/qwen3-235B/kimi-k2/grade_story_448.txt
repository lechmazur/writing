<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's rebellious docility and distrust are established but underexplored; motivations are clear but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot is tightly structured but occasionally rushed, especially during the transition from attic scene to resolution; cause-effect remains logical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Immersive, tactile details (lavender/coal scent, moonlight pooling) create a cohesive, original world; some connections between setting and action could be sharper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (e.g., "threads of yesterday") elevate themes; ending resonates but subtext and character psychology could be more intricately layered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original concept execution with fresh imagery ("constellations of soot"), but occasional overwritten phrases ("soot-flowers") undercut subtlety; emotional beats lean on lyrical prose over nuanced nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Creative fusion of elements with tight focus on legacy/innovation; brevity occasionally sacrifices emotional impact, but structural precision and thematic unity are strong.</comment>
