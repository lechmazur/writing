<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is vividly rendered through specific details, but motivation remains underexplored beyond surface-level existential defiance; the scar-as-past trope lacks depth despite strong visual cues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from desperation to ambiguous hope, but the marble-driven revelation feels under-explained; pacing is deliberate but slightly strained by word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hyper-specific sensory overload creates an instantly immersive, original cyberpunk atmosphere; every element from chrome lungs to neon kanji reflections enhances mood and thematics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (hummingbird heart, marbles as traumas) resonate, and the kindness-as-resistance theme is effective, but some imagery verges on self-indulgent; ending balances sentiment and restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Subverts "cyberpunk redemption" tropes through mundane kindness and broken symbolism, but occasional phrases ("world on fire") recycle genre shorthand; emotional resonance emerges through understatement rather than formulaic beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole; the brief format focuses rather than limits, though slight seams show in the marbles' symbolic function and storm timeframe integration.</comment>
