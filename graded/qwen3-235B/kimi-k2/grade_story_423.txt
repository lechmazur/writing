<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character remains idealized with little psychological complexity. Motivation is clear but thinly developed. Emotional revelation feels dictated by concept rather than organic. Voice lacks distinctiveness despite poetic narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a mystical logic but lacks narrative tension. The central act of triggering is effective but resolution feels predetermined rather than earned. Pacing is controlled but sacrifices depth for symbolic payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frozen desert setting is rendered with vivid sensory details that enhance the mood. The aqueduct evokes haunting beauty, but connections between spaces (greenhouse/aqueduct) feel more thematic than viscerally realized. Timeframe remains nebulous.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical framework and lyrical prose create emotional resonance. The symbolic connection between tears, memory, and growth offers thematic depth. Some emotional beats feel guided by concept rather than earned through narrative progression.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The writing displays literary ambition with fresh metaphors, but occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction ("children played in the spray"). Emotional arcs lean on conceptual associations more than felt experience. Overall style is accomplished but occasionally veers into poetic excess.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story maintains sufficient cohesion across assigned elements but sometimes feels more conceptually compelled than organically structured. The metaphorical approach works well within the constraint, though the ending feels more thematic than emotionally earned.</comment>
