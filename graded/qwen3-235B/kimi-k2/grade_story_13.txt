<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's solemnity is consistent, but the depth of their motivation and transformation is hinted through symbolism rather than fully dramatized. The fusion of internal growth with external actions is poetic but lacks emotional granularity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a mythic, symbolic trajectory with clear progression from entering the lab to planting the seed. Pacing is purposeful, though the abstract nature of the arc relies on mood over concrete cause-effect, which may test coherence for some readers.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rich atmospheric details (frozen gears, rust-roses soil) immerse readers in a decaying yet mystical world. The setting’s surrealism enhances the character’s introspection and the story’s existential themes without feeling ornamental.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (“vine-script,” “petals opening into eyes”) and themes of healing through surrender are evocative and layered. The reflective ending avoids triteness, tying imagery to the swordsman’s quiet metamorphosis with subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Narrative avoids clichés through inventive combinations (poems as a guide; time-as-space motif) but occasionally leans on heavily symbolic language that borders on self-indulgent. Emotional resonance is earned but sometimes abstract.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story’s cohesion is admirable, weaving assigned elements into an allegorical whole. However, its brevity sacrifices some exploration of character psychology and narrative stakes, which a top-tier journal might demand.</comment>
