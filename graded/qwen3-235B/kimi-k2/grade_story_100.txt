<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character’s dream-driven curiosity and logical daring shape her actions, but emotional complexity is occasionally told rather than deeply shown.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot balances tight constraints well, though the inciting apology’s connection to the cosmic revelation feels slightly underdeveloped despite clear arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (pulsing bark, mossy stone) create haunting immersion, though moonlight’s symbolic mechanics could deepen further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids clichéd fantasy tropes; metaphors (moon’s hidden face as “counterfeit craters”) and eerie tone feel inventively executed with minimal ornate excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into thematically cohesive whole; constrained length sharpens tension rather than limiting scope.</comment>
