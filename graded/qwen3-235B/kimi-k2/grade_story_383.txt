<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character depth implied through poetic gestures and regret, but lacked explicit emotional progression. Motivations are allusive rather than grounded, weakening the impact of transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Minimal plot momentum; relies on cyclical stasis over progression. The tram’s arrival as climax feels unearned, though the metaphorical arc is conceptually complete.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ethereal atmosphere created through vivid but inconsistent details (e.g., "probability cloud" waitress leans too heavily on abstraction). Sensory elements evoke mood but falter in cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Linguistic inventiveness (e.g., "coffee that tasted like burnt stardust") elevates, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on metaphor. End aims for transcendence but lands as vague.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Uses tropes like "haunted general" with some subversion, but phrases like "mischievous wisdom" read as thematic scaffolding rather than organic. Avoids cliché but borders on stylistic indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Evocative fragments over cohesive whole. Elements like the diner’s collapse work conceptually but lack narrative weight. Style dazzles but doesn’t fully coalesce around a lasting theme.</comment>
