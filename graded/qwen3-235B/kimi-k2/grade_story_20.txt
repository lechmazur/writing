<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's melancholic history as a chronicler of lost causes is evocative, but motivation for specific actions remains ambiguously rooted in internal conflict rather than concrete personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Non-linear, lyrical structure maintains focus yet lacks traditional plot momentum; thematic resolution compensates for minimal incident through symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality in anthropomorphized objects, cosmic scale intimacy, and ambivalence toward activism avoids formulaic melancholia through specific, unexpected materiality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Constraints transform into thematic scaffolding rather than structural crutches; tonal consistency and conceptual density outweigh slight pacing looseness.</comment>
