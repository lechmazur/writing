<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Predictable sibling-love motivation lacks nuance beyond surface grief; emotional depth obscured by overwrought poeticism rather than earned character shading; transformation feels narratively imposed rather than psychologically inevitable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dense imagery sometimes suffocates plot momentum; the paper airplane timeframe device feels artificially tacked on; ritual climax follows too neatly from exposition without clear cause-effect tension; compressed arc loses some gravitas.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Abandoned amusement park setting rendered in competent but derivative decay-imagery; moonlight motif effective yet repetitive; atmosphere leans too heavily on gothic clich√©s without distinctive recontextualization of space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Masterful metaphoric layering of weaponized violence vs. passive compassion; arrow-to-dandelion seed motif transcends simplicity through structural repetition; ending evokes paradoxical power of weaponized vulnerability without didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strongly original conceptual framework of compassion as ontological sacrifice; some overwritten metaphors threaten coherence; avoids genre tropes through existential focus on loss of self; pacing occasionally loses momentum through dense ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically with minor tonal dissonance; decaying park provides organic context for emotional decay; paper airplane timeframe remains underintegrated; conceptual daring justifies structural constraints effectively but not perfectly.</comment>
