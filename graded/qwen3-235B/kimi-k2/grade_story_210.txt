<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Finch's scholarly curiosity and rebellious curiosity are shown through deliberate actions, but emotional depth remains surface-level. His motivation to merge past/future is consistent, but lacks internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear mystical resolution arc, but the compressed arc sacrifices some emotional payoff. The crossword solution driving the climax feels conceptually sound but narratively abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Brilliantly textured atmosphere with nautical decay, spectral light, and tactile elements (ink vibrations, splintered wood). The lighthouse itself acts as a living character through vivid sensory immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imaginative fusion of myth/tech creates strong thematic resonance. The lighthouse's dual nature as "archive/launchpad" offers philosophical weight, though some metaphors overload the narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but occasionally overwrites with "ink spilled like myth" parallels. Avoids genre clich√©s through technical specifics (satellite frequency), but some phrases ("whispers of old wood") border on trope.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Story functions as an elegant metaphor for bridging temporal divides. The brief form feels intentional rather than restrictive, though the thematic undercurrents deserve more nuanced expansion.</comment>
