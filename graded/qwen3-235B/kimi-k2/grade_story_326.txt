<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations and limitations are conceptually strong, but emotional depth and internal conflict remain underexplored, leaning on poetic abstraction rather than human (or fairy) specificity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compressed yet coherent throughline, though some transitions feel condensed. The cyclical structure of impermanence as triumph is effective within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Setting and sensory details are lush yet functional, with bioluminescent moss, phantom flames, and dying static all reinforcing thematic concerns of memory and transience.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through metaphor-dense prose. Subtext about mortality as sacred artistry lingers, though occasional overt statements dilute subtler impacts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in concept and execution, though occasional phrases ("sweetly fierce") verge on cliche. Lyrical voice is distinctive but occasionally risks losing narrative throughline in stylistic flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements harmonize thematically: mortal impermanence within immortal architecture, fire-as-memory as both plot engine and existential metaphor. Avoids checklist-style integration in favor of organic synthesis.</comment>
