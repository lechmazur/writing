<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strengths in showing Mire's transformation as a progression of consequences, but lacks depth in her internal conflict beyond surface-level irony. Motivation for power over nature is clear but feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect progression, but pacing feels compressed - the forest's decline and Mire's transformation occur with insufficient emotional weight within constraints. Some forced pacing in final act.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with tactile imagery (resin smell, spores, black snow), but 'lavishly humble' villagers create tonal confusion. Setting details overwhelm thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful metaphorical resonance with crafted miracles as both salvation and exploitation. The ending's poetic tragedy elevates the piece, though theme is occasionally explicit rather than nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but stumbles into ornate phrasemaking ("blacksmith’s hammer slung across her back like a promise"). Emotional resonance diluted by occasional self-indulgence in description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but lack friction - the forced fusion of manufacturing and mysticism could create richer tension. Leaves lingering questions about price of ambition, but execution feels predetermined rather than earned.</comment>
