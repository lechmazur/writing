<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits are conceptually anchored but lack psychological depth; motivation to solve the riddle is clear but feels mechanically tied to assigned attributes without emotional weight or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight cyclical arc with symbolic payoff, but pacing stumbles in middle transitions and vanishing coaster, feeling rushed despite strong thematic alignment between start/end.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere amplified by visceral descriptions (rust-eroded ink, blood-orange rails) and spatial metaphors; setting and object (doorknob/coaster) blend surrealism with tactile reality, enhancing narrative unity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("letters erode like rust") and thematic resonance (questioning as paradox) provoke reflection, though the closing mirror scene risks opacity over emotional payoff; tone is poetically consistent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("quiet mania," "bones of the coaster") that borders on self-indulgence; character reactions are poetic but underdeveloped emotionally.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically (each serves the paradox of inquiry), but the coaster's vanishing and mirrored doppelgängers strain logic; lingers ambiguously, balancing originality against slight contrivance.</comment>
