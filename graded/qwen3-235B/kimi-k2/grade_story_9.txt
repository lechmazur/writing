<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation tied to redemption and reclaiming agency is consistent, but interiority remains sparse despite lyrical narration. The character's shift from "selling fortunes" to active rebellion feels earned, though past actions (drilling permits) are mentioned without deeper psychological exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Progression via 13 locks creates structural symmetry, but the repetitive unlocking mechanism occasionally feels procedural rather than organic. The arc—from panic to transformation—is satisfying within constraints, though the inciting "lost years" aren't fully integrated into plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Visually arresting juxtaposition of neon decay and environmental collapse, with sensory details (liquified sweat, plastic cacti) that create visceral unease. The synthetic whiskey's "careless spills" as a metaphor for ecological neglect is masterfully executed, though corporate dystopia tropes border on cliché without deeper societal worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (billboards as "neon graveyard," water as rebellion) carry thematic weight. Subtext about exploiting both environment and spirituality resonates, amplified by ironic tone ("plastic cacti"). The final scene's hope feels earned rather than saccharine, though emotional beats occasionally veer toward abstraction rather than tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imagery feels original (liquid gold sweat, desert whispering sarcasm) but skirts purple prose in moments. Avoids algorithmic repetition through inventive metaphors ("billboards projected ads for bottled air"), though "probably unlikely" character trait underused. The integration of elemental magic with environmental themes prevents formulaic storytelling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements mesh tightly in concept (water rings revealing truth, desert's dying whisper) and execution. While the 13 locks device borders on gimmickry, the central metaphor of reconciliation with ecological trauma carries weight. Leaves a lingering impression of alchemical transformation as political act, though minor elements (billboards' collapse) lack follow-through.</comment>
