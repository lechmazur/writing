<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character motivations lack depth; the medium's cryptic nature remains surface-level, with insufficient exploration of how her "normally unusual" trait shapes her actions. Emotional resonance is undercut by abstract detachment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The accidental double-booking feels contrived, disrupting structural cohesion, but the story’s cyclical closure—linking copper stars to the sailor’s return—provides thematic resonance despite meandering pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Brine-soaked machinery, singing assembly arms, and vacuum-sealed dreams create an immersive liminal space. The atmosphere’s fusion of organic and synthetic elements elevates the tone, though the plant’s logic remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors ("grief into grammar") and recursive themes of myth-making linger. The ending’s generational retelling of stories transcends the word limit, though some lyrical flourishes border on self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by merging lullaby algorithms with ancestral myth, but occasional overreliance on alliteration ("solder and salt") and conceptual repetition suggest artificial flourishes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Concepts strain under the weight of metaphor (e.g., double-booking as inciting incident), yet the interplay of memory-as-firmware and myth-as-evolution lingers as a hauntingly original thesis.</comment>
