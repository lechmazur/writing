<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters lack psychological complexity; motivations (trust, cosmic pursuit) are stated but underdeveloped; monk's reactions feel archetypal rather than specific to his persona; dialogue doesn't deepen his inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear progression, but emotional payoff uneven; key's transformation and celestial climax logically follow from earlier actions, yet resolution feels abrupt; pacing effective but thematic development compressed by word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid auditory descriptions (melodies as "ghosts"), tactile contrasts (hot key, cooling metal) create immersive dissonance; atmosphere amplifies existential themes but occasionally overwhelms narrative substance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (betrayal as "ash," silence as earned emptiness) resonate; ending's thematic echo about impermanence creates lingering tension; subtext on commodified spirituality enriches narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid imagery occasionally veers into ornamental excess ("cracks between worlds" clich√©d); emotional subtext shown through symbolic actions rather than stated; some phrases risk poetic abstraction over narrative urgency.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Cohesive through atmospheric consistency despite fragmented elements; brevity serves meditative tone, though cosmic event feels abstract rather than viscerally rendered; ending rewards contemplation.</comment>
