<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sparse but poetic motivation; characterization leans heavily on metaphor rather than coherent psychology. The mechanic's sentience-as-cathedral conceit is intriguing but sacrifices emotional grounding for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Packs mythic arc into tight constraints with surreal symbolism, but lacks sufficient emotional beats to earn its ecstatic resolution. The infinity motif strains to bind beginning and end through repetitive metaphoric phrasing rather than earned narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visceral synesthetic details (singing metal, memory-fruit) create unforgettable synesthetic density. Atmosphere overpowers plot, risking sensory overload despite masterful tonal cohesion between cosmic and mechanical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Laser-focused symphony of metaphor where every image serves thematic purpose. The confession-as-technology premise achieves mythic resonance through compressed poetic precision that transcends its abstract characterizations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dazzling originality avoids genre tropes but occasionally lapses into self-indulgence - some phrases ("exultant grief") feel premeditated rather than organically earned through narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Narrative momentum struggles under conceptual weight but achieves haunting transcendence through its conceptual economy. The ending's thematic pay-off redeems occasional structural strain.</comment>
