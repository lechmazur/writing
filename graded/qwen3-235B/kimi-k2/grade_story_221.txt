<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are interwoven with symbolic elements but Elena's emotional transition feels underdeveloped. Mara's actions align with her traits, yet her sister's catharsis lacks nuanced reasoning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong circular structure and thematic resolution within constraints, but key emotional beats (Elena's shift) require more earned progression. Pacing balances poetic reflection with narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully constructed through sensory details (rusted metal, golden dust) and symbolic cohesion between the decaying carnival and suspended emotions. Setting becomes a character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Potent use of light/shadow metaphors and recursive symbolism (amber, letters) create thematic depth. Occasional over-reliance on poetic abstraction slightly dilutes emotional immediacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt formulaic writing with fresh combinations (ghost whisperer at carnival), but some phrases border on lyrical clich√©s. Emotions shown through objects more than actions, with intentional stylistic flourishes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements like the amber and carnival serve thematic purposes without feeling imposed. The story's brevity enhances its ghostly transience, but emotional payoff could resonate more viscerally.</comment>
