<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation and assigned traits are present but somewhat surface-level; dialogue lacks distinctiveness. "Nomadic dreamer" role is clear but insufficiently nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot uses workshop setting's structure effectively. However, the mission's mechanics feel slightly schematic, relying on familiar infiltration tropes without fresh twists.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Workshop atmosphere is superficially evocative but lacks immersive, specific sensory details beyond visual elements. Mariner’s wheel’s juxtaposition is interesting but underexplained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic resonance (preservation as salvation) and effective subtext. Some emotions ("anguished joy") are stated rather than dramatized, reducing impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains slightly predictable spy-narrative beats. Language occasionally veers toward floral purple prose ("thundering in her chest") but mostly remains taut.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated with minimal narrative friction. Writing demonstrates creative problem-solving for constraints, though the premise’s speculative implications remain underexplored.</comment>
