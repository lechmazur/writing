<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped; transition from "fretful" to "bold" lacks sufficient psychological depth. Internal conflict hinted at but remains superficial. Archery profession only loosely tied to narrative function. Voice occasionally striking but inconsistent in tone. Strength in symbolic transformation at climax.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on convenient emotional climax rather than earned progression. Anachronistic TV subtitle device creates narrative dissonance but doesn't break plot logic. Strong beginning/middle/end framework within word constraints. Pacing mostly controlled despite rushed backstory exposition. Concept of forbidden stories effectively shapes action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setting achieves basic historical texture through specific details (limestone, desert heat) but misses opportunities for deeper cultural immersion. Tone attempts mystical realism but inconsistent sensory engagement - more poetic abstraction than tangible atmosphere. Timeframe metaphor ("fading photograph") intriguing conceptually but poorly integrated narratively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor ("arrows aimed not to kill") and symbolic resonance. Subtext about narrative authority and cultural erasure adds intellectual weight. Ending transcends predictability through visceral imagery. Emotional impact undercut by overreliance on declarative statements rather than experiential immersion. Writing style uneven but contains memorable passages.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (TV subtitles in dreams) and familiar tropes (dying grandmother's secret). Language occasionally veers toward purple prose ("fragility and its strength simultaneously"). Emotional progression leans on explicit description rather than nuanced subtext. Anachronism adds originality but strains authenticity. Avoids complete formulaic structure through idiosyncratic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Story successfully integrates most elements cohesively despite structural limitations. Brief length works as intentional stylistic choice highlighting pivotal moment rather than narrative expansion. Creativity evident in story-recipe concept, though execution inconsistent. Final scene achieves thematic payoff but lacks lasting emotional resonance. Style ranges from vivid to ornate with uneven effectiveness.</comment>
