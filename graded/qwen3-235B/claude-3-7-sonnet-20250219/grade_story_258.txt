<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character shows depth through blending professional identity (locksmith) with cultural duty. Jaded wonder voice consistent but lacks interiority beyond surface reactions. Motivation (preserving heritage) ties to actions without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tight circular structure connects leaf dropping to stabilized orchard through key-forming revelation. Pacing efficient but condenses myth-building; transitions between workshop scene and crisis could be smoother. Concept (storm as secrets) drives unconventional but logical resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere exceptionally rendered through tactile details: salt winds stripping leaves, driftwood creaks, "whispered goodbye" from falling leaf. Setting's physical/metaphysical duality provides concrete metaphors (floating orchard as cultural memory vessel) without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Story uses lock imagery as extended metaphor for cultural preservation. Ending achieves thematic closure without neatness, suggesting ongoing stewardship. Shows through movement (prancing) rather than telling; subtle subtext about transmission through performance vs. static documentation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tells through specific details (questionable annotations, prancing instructions in yearbooks). Some phrases ("physically metaphysical") risk vagueness but redeemed by organic integration with plot logic. Maintains consistent mythic tone without overwrought language or predictable emotional beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Element cohesion exceptional - each requirement shapes narrative essentials. Timeframe drives plot clock, setting provides stakes, torn map initiates arc. Leaves lingering resonance through linking personal (grandmother's journal) and collective memory. Brief length feels artistically necessary rather than constrained.</comment>
