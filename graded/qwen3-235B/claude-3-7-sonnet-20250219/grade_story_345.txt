<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Internal conflict of doubt vs. faith is clear but lacks tangible depth; motivation to seek redemption drives the plot, but character voice remains somewhat generic despite introspective narration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear progression from uncertainty to revelation, but the choice between paths and closing door feel rushed; cause-effect logic cohesive yet relies excessively on symbolic shorthand rather than earned development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Phantasmagoric orchard and "dull radiance" create immersive, liminal atmosphere; underutilized sensory potential (e.g., sounds of stalks, weight of abacus) slightly hinders visceral immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dreamlike symbolism (abacus as fractured faith, snow as divine signage) elevates thematic nuance; ending avoids sentimentalism but leans on abstract idealism that may feel emotionally distant to some readers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts "returning priest" trope by embracing uncertainty over dogma; metaphors feel fresh (beanstalks as faith's obfuscation), though occasional adjectival density ("unapologetically confused") teeters toward forced poeticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements merge elegantly into a thematically unified whole; brevity serves the parabolic tone but sacrifices deeper character context that could enhance emotional stakes.</comment>
