<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation clear and consistent; Elias's obsession with crosswords as communication with the dead is compelling, but lacks depth in internal conflict or emotional nuance. Actions align with motivation but character remains surface-level due to limited introspection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Crossword creation drives plot effectively. Connection between opening crafting and resolution at the bell tower is strong. Pacing is efficient within word limit, though some emotional beats (e.g., wife's backstory) feel underdeveloped. Logical cause-effect relationships maintain narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid with sensory details (ink, creaking stairs, keys ringing) that enhance mood. Setting/timeframe support theme of liminality between worlds. Some moments feel slightly overwritten ("noble chaos" lacks specificity), but overall tone is cohesive and immersive within constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concept of words bridging worlds creates emotional resonance. Effective use of symbolic metaphors (crosswords as "linguistic traps"). Story conveys deeper themes of memory and reconciliation, though ending feels slightly pat in its resolution of tension between realms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids common afterlife tropes through unique crossword-as-portal mechanism. Some phrases ("whispers like mist") border on clich√©d. Writing style is purposeful but occasionally veers into ornate descriptions. Emotional nuance present but not fully maximized beyond stated motives.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around theme of posthumous communication. Brief length serves the story well. Leverages constraints effectively to create lingering questions about the nature of reconciliation. Conceptual consistency maintained despite high density of assigned elements.</comment>
