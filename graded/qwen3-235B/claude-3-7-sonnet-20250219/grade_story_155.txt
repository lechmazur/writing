<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character's skill as a welder and "patiently impatient" trait are established but underutilized in driving decisions; motivations tied to inherited mystery feel surface-level without deeper psychological exploration of choice between worlds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Button box discovery cleanly initiates plot, celestial alignment provides ticking clock, but the compressed word limit forces rushed emotional beats during the climactic choice; cause/effect between mirrored glimpses and final decision lacks nuanced build-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken planetarium-turned-nightclub creates haunting atmosphere where fractured projections mirror both physical and existential dissonance; sensory details (welding torch underwater, mirror distortions) enhance thematic resonance more than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</comment><question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (welding as mending reality) and symbolic imagery (light refraction as liminality) elevate craft, but emotional impact diluted by abrupt tonal shifts between melancholy and wonder; central theme of duality remains under-developed despite strong visual scaffolding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique element combinations (elemental power through glass discs), but some sensory details lean generic ("impossible colors," "trembled"); writing style occasionally prioritizes lyrical flourishes over grounded emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (box connects welder's skill to cosmic power), but execution feels more like puzzle-box construction than organically grown story; brevity prioritizes atmosphere over character depth, leaving thematic weight uneven.</comment>
