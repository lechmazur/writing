<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Max's phobia and profession drive his actions consistently, but his inner voice lacks distinctness. The therapist's "mundanely spiritual" line adds depth, though psychological complexity remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear arc from fear to triumph, but pacing feels rushed in the final transition. Cause/effect of knot-untying is logical, though time compression weakens emotional payoff. Concept shapes plot but lacks nuance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Egyptian heat and eerie whispers create vivid atmosphere. Pyramid library setting effectively Gothic, tying to ancient ritual. Gar-sale backstory provides practical connection to quest, but sensory details occasionally generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (knots=fear) work but lack originality. Ending shows transformation rather than explaining it, though emotional impact is diluted by underdeveloped subtext. Writing style is competent but unremarkable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "ancient wisdom saves modern man" trope. Language remains clear without purple prose, but no striking stylistic fingerprint. Emotional resonance is present without feeling profound or subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere overall but lack deeper interconnection. Word limit forces abrupt transitions, yet ending provides satisfying closure. Story achieves brevity's purpose without transcending into exceptional literary impact.</comment>
