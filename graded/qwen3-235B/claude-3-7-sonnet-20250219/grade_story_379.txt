<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Past contradictions like "impatiently patient" are stated but underexplored; redemption arc feels abrupt rather than earned through nuanced behavioral shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compact cause-effect (drones diverted â†’ preservation task completed) works efficiently; tighter structure could have been achieved with clearer stakes driving the diversion's risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory integration of artificial environments (humming hydroponics, synthetic sunlight) deepens melancholic tone; the world's decay outside the dome effectively contextualizes linguistic loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with specific details (Inuit dialects, hydroponic emergency sequences); the "trickster-turned-preservationist" twist feels purposeful rather than derivative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements synergize cohesively; the brevity emphasizes thematic efficiency, though the short ending could have lingered longer on the ethical irony of a manipulator saving truth.</comment>
