<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Characters show potential but lack sufficient depth; Marcus's motivations shift abruptly without backstory, Mira's "delightfully strange" attribute lacks nuance beyond surface-level actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pivotal moments (triggering the panel) rely on contrivance rather than organic development; pacing uneven in transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lab/wedding juxtaposition creates intriguing contrast; sensory details present (bioluminescence, glass walls) but insufficient to fully immerse readers in the speculative atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Successful use of symbolism (sunrise/light = truth) and theme about stories containing hidden truths; dialogue occasionally stilted, ending too cleanly resolves complex tensions without deeper exploration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s (sentinel's growth, gifted child), but relies on familiar narrative patterns (forbidden science, misunderstood wisdom); language stays purposeful but lacks distinctive stylistic fingerprint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Weaves assigned elements competently but not masterfully; tone shifts from observational to wondrous feel abrupt rather than earned; compact form serves plot mechanics better than thematic complexity.</comment>
