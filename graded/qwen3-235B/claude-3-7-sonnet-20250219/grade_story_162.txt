<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marco's transition from gambler to truth-seeker and Eliza's quiet determination show promise but lack deeper exploration of their psychological shifts; motivations hinted at through dialogue but not fully embodied in actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses through deciphering the blueprint, but the tight word limit forces underdeveloped cause-effect; the ending feels abrupt despite thematic resolution, and the island's mystery remains too abstract to create a satisfying arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The reverse engineering workshop's atmosphere is evocative (broken devices, humming machinery), and videotapes create a haunting undertone; however, sensory details are inconsistent, leaving the island memories feeling underrealized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like "hammered repose" and the blueprint-as-metaphor-for-trauma resonate; the dialogue carries subtext, and the central conflict of confronting buried truths is emotionally engaging, though the ending lacks punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in premise but leans on predictable character beats (trustworthy gambler, haunted workshop); "green sky" leans toward trope territory, while the unexplored videotapes hint at potential but feel underutilized.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story synthesizes elements cohesively but feels constrained by its ambition; themes of secrecy and fragmentation resonate, yet the brevity leaves ideas like the island's chaos underexplored, diminishing its lasting impact.</comment>
