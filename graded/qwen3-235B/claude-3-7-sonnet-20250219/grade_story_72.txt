<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Envoy's sneer consistently reflects his bureaucratic disdain; Elena's 'controlled fury' is shown through restrained actions and dialogue. Weakness: Elena's deeper motivations beyond professional pride and scientific ambition remain underexplored, reducing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Clear three-act progression from confrontation to revelation. Weakness: Pacing inconsistencies - the 'sift' action feels rushed, lacking tension building to the discovery; resolution feels slightly pat given the 500-word constraint.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengths: Sensory details (rust-colored soil, moisture-laden air) create immersive Martian environment. Weakness: Timeframe phrase 'across the hush of a possibility just born' feels portentous without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Metaphors (vineyard as cathedral, leaves as data-bearers) enhance thematic weight; ending resonates with tangible wonder. Weakness: Dialogue occasionally serves exposition rather than character dynamics.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strengths: Starlight-siphoning vines offer fresh biological conceit; avoids most bureaucratic sci-fi tropes. Weakness: Some phrases ('living cathedral', 'cup starlight in mortal palms') border on poetic excess; Elena's characterization leans on scientist-saint archetype.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative precision; length constraints sacrifice some character nuance for atmospheric payoff.</comment>
