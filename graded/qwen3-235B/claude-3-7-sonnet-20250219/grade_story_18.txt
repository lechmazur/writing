<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marble's telepathy and trapped existence drive his motivation to seek truth, but his emotional depth could be more nuanced beyond "tragically joyful" surface. Reactions to the hair tie and Eliza's recognition demonstrate consistency, though character voice lacks distinctive texture in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from curse to resolution, with calligraphy method coherently tied to telepathy. Transformation lacks visceral buildup. Pacing feels slightly rushed in the final act, but the connection between beginning (hair tie's endurance) and end (its activation) is strong.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vaporwick's steampunk atmosphere is evocative but underutilized—hissing pipes/soot set mood but rarely influence plot. Light/shadow contrasts between gloomy cheerfulness and luminescent ink enhance tone, though specific sensory details (e.g., tactile granite texture) could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ending's theme about recognition as freedom resonates emotionally. Subtle use of "transformation as revelation" symbolism and fading telepathy adds depth. Dialogue feels slightly stilted, and some "showing" (e.g., Marble's physical sensations during change) could strengthen impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Calligraphy incantation adds originality, but "living statue" and steampunk elements risk cliché. Hair tie as key avoids predictability. Prose leans on elegant metaphors ("watercolors bleeding") but occasionally slips into ornate descriptors ("beautifully terrifying"). Emotional subtext feels genuine despite formulaic beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated but not revolutionary. Forced connections (e.g., "weatherize" as narrative conflict) feel perfunctory. Style balances lyrical and efficient, but depth is constrained by word limit. Resolution lingers thematically even if plot mechanics remain surface-level.</comment>
