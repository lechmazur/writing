<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Limited emotional complexity; motivation is clear but backstory lacks depth. The teapot reveals character through ritual, but internal conflicts remain underexplored. Actions align with anger and purpose, but humanity feels restrained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but pacing uneven. The marathon's symbolic link to the mission feels tenuous. Cause-effect logic holds, but the connection between training and plot mechanics isn't fully earned. Resolution lacks tension payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ghost train's decayed grandeur provides vivid, eerie backdrop. Atmospheric details (moonlight, creaking floorboards) immerse effectively, but deeper integration of the setting's history with Markus's work could enhance thematic resonance. Aloof passion tone occasionally clashes with environment's theatricality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subtextual tension between tradition/modernity shines via encrypted playlists-as-plant-data. Teapot-as-legacy-object evokes poignant symbolism. Ending's spiritual whisper is touching but risks sentimentality. Writing style remains crisp, though emotional beats sometimes verge on explicit rather than fully shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blends speculative tech with indigenous wisdom in fresh ways, but "haunted lab" trope feels overstretched. Occasional overdescriptive phasing ("maintaining an angrily peaceful existence") flirts with purple prose. Motivations lean on genre archetypes rather than humanistic nuance. Avoids total predictability through unusual method-object pairings.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve story but cohesion wavers. Ghost train and teapot are organic; marathon regimen's repetition feels narratively inflated. Conceptual framework (music encryption) is inventive but under-researched technical logic weakens plausibility. Style elevates material while key thematic connections remain implicit rather than resonantly earned.</comment>
