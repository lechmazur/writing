<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eliza's internal conflict is hinted at but lacks depth; her transformation feels compressed, sacrificing genuine emotional nuance for convenient symbolism. Her motivations pivot abruptly without sufficient psychological grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot pivots on underdeveloped causal links (communityâ€™s rapid adoption of ideas) and compressed timelines. The conceptual arc works structurally, but the execution feels schematic rather than earned through organic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eerie, crystalline imagery effectively contrasts fragility and resilience, but the subterranean setting occasionally leans on generic exoticism rather than distinctive physical or cultural textures that could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong use of symbols (key, birds) to convey themes, but emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract language. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks visceral impact due to underdeveloped stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt AI tropes through specific biological metaphors, but some transitions rely on familiar diplomatic-narrative conventions. Prose balances clarity and lyricism, though occasional abstractions weaken immediacy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but occasionally strain plausibility for the word count. The central theme of decentralized systems is compellingly realized, though emotional impact remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>
