<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's confidence and duality (watchman vs. teacher) are established but underdeveloped; motivations (yearning/envy) are present but lack psychological depth; dialogue with larvae feels artificially symbolic rather than organically gentler. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression from discovery to mobilization follows logical cause-effect, but the compressed word limit creates rushed emotional transitions; the resolution feels too conveniently hopeful without sufficient narrative heft. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion in the beehive with amber corridors and honeycomb textures; atmosphere powerfully combines sweetness and entrapment; temporal references to coloring sessions provide rhythmic structure. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emotional resonance through symbol (cracked ruler) and subtext (human inadequacy vs. hive perfection); ending avoids sentimentality by focusing on preparatory actions; conflict between duty and hope feels psychologically nuanced. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional clich√©d phrasing ("echo of yearning," "melody of hope"); emotional shifts occasionally spelled out rather than shown; fingerprint coincidence strains credibility. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but lack perfect synergy; prose shows stylistic confidence with notable exceptions; brevity serves the core idea but limits thematic expansion; evokes contemplation about belonging and legacy. </comment>
