<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth beyond narrative role; motivation is clear but underexplored; "bitter laughter" surfaces but isn't fully integrated into characterization; immortality concept shapes plot more than personality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong cyclical structure but relies on convenient "accident" premise; plot progression efficient within constraints yet slightly overstretched; pacing balances slow decay with sudden restoration but some leaps in logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal quantum setting vividly imagined but sensory details insufficient; tone shifts effectively mirror thematic transformation; physical decay contrasts with subatomic vitality but atmospheric cohesion occasionally breaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness in encoded accident/resurrection concept; ending resonates thematically; shows through ink patterns/actions but tells emotions in transitions; maintains central conflict of neglect vs renewal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate description; character reasoning balances logic/emotion; metaphors (ink as code) inventive; subtle subversion of cursed immortality as eventual strength.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements interdependent (earbud/ink/garden); some underutilized aspects (rigidly flexible principle); brevity enhances thematic focus; leaves reflection on impermanence/reclamation but could deepen emotional resonance.</comment>
