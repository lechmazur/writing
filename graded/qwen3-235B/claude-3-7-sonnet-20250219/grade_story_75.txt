<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elian's guardedness and motivation from fabricated past are integral to his actions, but Mira remains a reactive device without internal conflict; dialogue feels functional rather than distinct.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot moves from isolation to active rebellion in tight word count, but the resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between vow decryption and exodus is logical but lacks escalating stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Nano-forest's microcosmic setting visually supports the theme of preservation, but sensory details (bioluminescent flowers, synthetic bird sounds) are overly generic rather than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strengthens theme through plastic bookmark as shattered-memories symbol; emotional tension between rage/hope is potent. Ending announcement lacks visceral follow-through, weakening closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids full clich√© with nano-forest uniqueness, but "Collective" villain skews generic; some ornate phrases ("angry peace") feel pretentious rather than precise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into urgent parable about art as resistance; underexploited potential in Mira's skepticism and atmospheric details. Leaves thematic questions without over-explanation.</comment>
