<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear structure satisfies brief completeness but feels compressed; plot hinges on a single interaction, limiting depth of cause-effect; pacing deliberate but occasionally static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some overused tropes (mystical ethnicized artist, enchanted artifacts) undercut originality; language occasionally borders on purple prose but avoids outright clich√© through specific imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>All elements function cohesively with minor redundancy; brevity serves the mystical vignette form; lingers conceptually without feeling incomplete.</comment>
