<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Harlow’s motivation (to stop the mirror’s deception) is clear and ties to his actions, but emotional depth lacks nuance. His “awkwardly charming” voice feels surface-level, though the bulb’s role in revealing his history adds coherence.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot progression through bulb placement and moon alignment is logical, with cause-effect clarity. The tight word limit strains pacing slightly (e.g., backstories feel rushed), but the beginning-middle-end arc holds. Concept shapes the plot effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly rendered: crystalline acoustics, rainbow reflections, and “mineral dust” create immersive atmosphere. Sensory details deepen tone and reinforce themes (e.g., “opalescent” transformation mirrors truth).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Craft is strong: orchid-as-memories symbolism, mirror subversion, and layered metaphors evoke emotional resonance. The theme of confronting distorted truth is consistently conveyed. Ending resolves with poetic closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, offers fresh twists (e.g., orchid blooming into a mirror). Prose occasionally veers into ornate phrasing (“quiet longing of centuries”), but imagery remains specific and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively integrated; the story’s brevity feels deliberate. Combines assigned components inventively (e.g., moon-tracking for transformation) and leaves lingering thematic weight.</comment>
