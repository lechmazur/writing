<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but lacks emotional depth. The reticent scholar's transformation during the ritual feels abrupt rather than earned through gradual development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structurally sound but relies heavily on convenience (hidden sketches, instant apparitions). The abrupt resolution via social media lacks narrative payoff within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (flooded opera house contrasts with cake baking) but underutilizes sensory details for the echoes' historical periods. The setting enhances the theme but feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (echoes as preserved history) and satisfying thematic resolution. Emotional resonance is surface-level; the ending tells more than shows impact through social media references.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but leans on supernatural convenience. Language is concise but occasionally veers into ornate descriptions (e.g., "soul of the space"). Concept feels derivative of ghostly "voices in walls" tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but some (dictionary sketches, cake baking) feel tacked on. Strong theme of preservation vs. progress; brevity sacrifices deeper exploration of character and consequence.</comment>
