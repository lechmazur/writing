<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character development is clear but abrupt; Valen's motivation for marrying Lian remains underexplored, weakening emotional investment in his transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; key moments (e.g., Valen sheathing his sword) lack sufficient build-up, slightly undermining narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (ink, weathered threads) enhances the contemplative atmosphere, though the setting could better integrate with the protagonist's internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbolism (tapestry, song) and subtext about surrender vs. dominance resonate, but thematic depth is occasionally undercut by didactic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some tropes (wise old master, arrogant hero’s redemption) feel derivative; the song and tapestry avoid cliché but are inconsistently weighted in the narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is achieved but uneven; certain elements (e.g., "between breaths" timeframe) feel abstracted from the core conflict rather than intrinsic to it.</comment>
