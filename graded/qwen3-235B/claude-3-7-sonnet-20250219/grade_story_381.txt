<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation (mapping to digitally resurrect his partner) is clear and emotionally resonant, but his necromantic abilities are underdeveloped - they don't significantly influence his actions or interactions with the setting, weakening the connection between his assigned attribute and core story function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through precise mapping sequences and emotional flashbacks. The constraint forces some narrative compression, but the convergence of physical mapping/quantum anchors with emotional resolution through film references creates satisfying structural harmony even within limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Crystalline cave's bioluminescent visuals and resonant shifts create vivid, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details (humming crystals, cap's faded logo) beautifully blend sci-fi and necromantic elements, though quantum mechanics occasionally overwhelm the mystical aspects. Timeframe between structural shifts masterfully enhances tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Emotional impact comes through restrained "showing" of grief via actions (backwards cap, film-shaped crystals) rather than exposition. Metaphors (digital afterlife as tomb) and subtext (cinema as shared mythology) create thematic richness. Ending's intersection imagery encapsulates all narrative threads.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI hallmarks - fusion of necromancy/sci-fi is fresh, emotional nuance beyond surface sadness, and sensory details specific (art deco crystals) rather than generic. Some phrases ("discernible theme", "cutting-edge technology") lean toward formulaic phrasing, but overall inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>All elements work in concert - baseball cap, film references, and quantum/necromantic methods organically serve character's motivation. The brevity feels purposeful, with each image weighted for maximum emotional resonance. Creates lingering contemplation about technology's role in preserving memory.</comment>
