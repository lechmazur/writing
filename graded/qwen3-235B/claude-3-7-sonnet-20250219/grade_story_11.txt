<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's flighty nature and anger are established but underdeveloped; motivations feel partially surface-level. Emotional resonance exists but lacks depth in demonstrating how her traits shape decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Pacing struggles within the word limit; the sudden shift from three days of work to resolution feels rushed, though the arc from restless cartographer to fulfilled successor is clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere has vivid snapshots (stained glass, painted ceilings) but lacks sustained sensory immersion; the "centuries of cartographic knowledge" concept is underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Symbolism (patch, coordinates) and theme of unity are effective but undercut by predictable emotional beats; the ending feels emotionally neat rather than earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Some fresh combinations (mechanic's patch + secret society) but relies on familiar tropes (hidden map codes in art); prose avoids overt purple prose but occasionally settles for efficient over evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but uneven integration of elements; the premise shows ingenuity but lacks narrative ambition that would push it beyond competent to transcendent.</comment>
