<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivations shift abruptly without sufficient internal conflict; Jasper's transformation from gambler to witness lacks psychological depth, while supporting characters serve more as archetypes than fully-realized personas.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>While rising tension is effectively established through the professors' appearances, the abrupt convergence of all five characters and the underdeveloped explanation of Jasper's pivotal role disrupt narrative cohesion within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like algae-infused candles and turbine hums create a haunting maritime atmosphere; the tidal station's isolation and lunar timeframe enhance the eerie tone through consistent environmental integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical use of candles and oceanic resurgence carries thematic weight; dialogue feels stylized rather than natural, but the haunting final image achieves emotional resonance through vivid, symbolic action rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with blue-flame candles and energy spikes, but professors' archetypal madness and sudden collective appearance lean toward familiar tropes without sufficient subversion, while prose balances atmospheric detail with moments of unnecessary ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements like candles and tidal mechanics feel integrated, though conceptual connections (unspoken bargains) remain underexplored; the ending's existential weight partially compensates for uneven narrative scaffolding within the brief format.</comment>
