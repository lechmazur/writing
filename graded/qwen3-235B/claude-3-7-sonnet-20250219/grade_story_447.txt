<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation to mend the community is clear, but inner conflicts between duty and rebellion remain underexplored; her "voice" lacks distinctiveness despite first-person implications.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Future bulletins drive the plot effectively, but the compressed arc feels rushed in reconciling cause-effect chains (e.g., mayor's suspicion); episodic structure weakens narrative cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative details like "amber prison" establish mood, but connections between setting (yellowed walls) and the supernatural element (toy ear's warmth) lack symbolic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong metaphors ("amber prison") and satisfying arc (retiring the toy ear) convey themes of decay/renewal; emotional resonance is present but could be more viscerally shown, not told.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original twist on "prophecy" with journalistic ethics; avoids clich√©s but relies on predictable social dynamics (gentrification resistance); prose balances clarity and purposeful detail without succumbing to ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere around Eliza's mission, though some (timeframe during cooking) feel perfunctory; brevity serves the parable-like tone but leaves thematic layers underdeveloped.</comment>
