<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dr. Swarm's hive-mind trait is superficially unique but lacks psychological depth; Mercer's trauma is clear but underdeveloped due to word constraints. Their motivations drive the narrative but feel mechanically resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong despite tight word limit: the wax drip's coded revelations drive the arc from resistance to resolution. Pacing works, but Budapest backstory feels truncated, weakening emotional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends spy-novel tension with ethereal therapy elements, but setting details (facility, bridge) remain generic. Candle wax symbolism and sensory details like the charger create immersion but lack deeper integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Effective metaphor use (wax as memory) and cyclical structure elevate the story. The breakthrough moment resonates, but dialogue-heavy resolution feels rushed. Theme of confronting the past is clear but not deeply subtextual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids major AI-adjacent tropes, though the hive-mind therapist verges on gimmickry. Wax patterns as trauma representation are original but occasionally overwritten. Emotional nuance in Mercer's arc surpasses procedural tropes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative but rarely transcend. The secret agent framework feels imposed rather than organic, yet the candle-based therapy method and Mercer's arc show creative integration. Ending satisfies but lingers minimally.</comment>
