<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited depth in personal character development beyond the profession; the motivation to weave emotional honesty is clear but not deeply rooted in individual trauma or backstory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from preparation to transformation but feels compressed; the central mystery’s resolution is hinted at rather than demonstrated, leaving some narrative gaps due to length constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (synthetic bamboo, light through debris) effectively immerse the reader, but the interplay between the setting and character psychology could be more nuanced or visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (e.g., “sunbeams illuminating essence”) and subtext about truth in performance; emotional resonance is undercut by occasional explicit statements rather than fully “shown” nuance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Visionary concept avoids overt tropes but occasionally relies on familiar phrases (“dance like spirits”) and idealized descriptions that slightly dilute the grit of a post-apocalyptic world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically and thematically, but some aspects (e.g., rapid shifts into the “frightened young woman” persona) feel surface-level, limiting transcendent impact.</comment>
