<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Madame Vex’s duality as a scientific ex-physicist and emotionally intuitive counselor is compelling, but the client’s existential crisis lacks emotional depth despite conceptual intrigue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and conceptually tight, but the ending’s abruptness disrupts narrative flow, leaving the client’s transformation underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (amber light, zapping pool) create vivid atmosphere. Time travel’s integration with heartbreak counseling is innovative, though secondary settings feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (desires as gravitational force, time as a “pool”) are evocative. Subtext on identity and autonomy resonates. Dialogue is sparse but impactful. Ending’s thematic payoff is strong.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original twist on time travel tropes (agency manipulation, self-hunting). Avoids sentimentality; metaphors are fresh. Slight over-reliance on “femme fatale” framework is tempered by nuance in character voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically rich whole. The brevity serves the story’s existential tone, though some ideas (e.g., resistance movement) feel underexplored.</comment>
