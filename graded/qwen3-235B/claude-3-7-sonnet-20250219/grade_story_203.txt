<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character traits of exorcist and stage fright remain underexplored; motivations shift without sufficient emotional grounding. The revelation of truth doesn't fully integrate his inner conflict, leaving personal transformation feeling abrupt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear arc from inherited lies to legacy reclamation, but pacing stumbles during transition from factory setting to surreal garden. Cause-effect logic holds but feels compressed, particularly in mechanical resurrection sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dense sensory contrasts between sterile space station and organic garden create immersive dissonance. Orbital debris as persistent sonic motif enhances existential atmosphere; toy factory's uncanny valley ambiance amplifies tension.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors of creation vs. erasure resonate through botanical motifs. Subtext about inherited legacies feels poignant; ending avoids pat resolution by emphasizing ongoing transformation. Conflict is existential rather than dramatic, prioritizing thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nuanced emotional beats emerge through tactile details (trembling hands, glowing petals) rather than exposition. Avoids genre clich√©s by reframing exorcism as reality-sculpting. Occasionally leans on poetic abstraction when more precise imagery could land harder.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically if occasionally strained narratively. The garden's revelation feels earned through layered symbolism. Word economy sacrifices some transitions, but tonal consistency maintains an air of cosmic melancholy and rebirth.</comment>
