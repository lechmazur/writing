<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lacks psychological depth beyond surface traits; motivation propelled by plot devices rather than organic character evolution; "sharp gentleness" stated but not dramatized through specific interactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Chronological progression feels complete but slightly compressed; thematic symmetry between grandmother's legacy and protagonist's revelation satisfying despite constraints; some cause/effect connections (button's power) under-explained within tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Multisensory immersion in the floating library's physicality creates tangible atmosphere; certain details like radio static and cotton-candy clouds verge on whimsical excess rather than atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical layers (librarians/cosmos connection) conceptually engaging but emotionally muted; ending resolves intellectual mystery rather than character arc; subtext about intergenerational legacy could be more nuanced.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise marred by occasional generic descriptors ("amber light," "distant stars"); character reactions blend archetypal logic with genuine surprise; avoids most clich√©s while occasionally prioritizing concept over emotional realism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements integrated with ingenuity but uneven narrative weight; ambitious themes occasionally outpace brief canvas; atmospheric richness compensates somewhat for compressed emotional development.</comment>
