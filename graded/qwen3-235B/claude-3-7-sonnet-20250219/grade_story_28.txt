<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear, but her personality beyond determination lacks depth; the "sly agent" trait manifests only marginally through fork manipulation, not through distinct voice or nuanced decision-making.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Puzzle mechanics drive plot cohesion, but the abrupt ending feels like a checklist resolution rather than earned catharsis; recovery sequence works within constraints but lacks escalating tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Carnival setting creates vivid decay through metallic/graveyard imagery, though fork/ritual connection isn't fully exploited; sensory details immerse without overwriting but fail to create thematic resonance between objects and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Archive-as-quest provides surface tension, but deeper themes (cultural erasure vs. progress) remain didactic rather than layered through subtext; ending's "spirits breathing life" leans toward cliché affirmation rather than earned emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Story avoids overt purple prose but employs familiar preservation-archivist tropes; "metallic graveyard" and Sunday family planning have mild originality, while "desperate optimism" tone declaration undercuts subtlety.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elements serve plot but lack alchemy—folklore preservation feels like thematic checklist rather than organic exploration; brevity works for urgency but sacrifices deeper character/thematic stakes.</comment>
