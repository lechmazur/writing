<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's naivety drives initial choices but motivations shift abruptly without sufficient internal exploration; transitions from humor to revelation lack emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plotted efficiently within constraints but relies on underdeveloped narrative bridges (e.g., weeks-long search compressed); resolution feels earned yet rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective sensory details (humming artifacts, warmth shifts) create immersive atmosphere; some elements (rumor-gatherings) lack environmental specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Resonant symbolism in statue's reconstruction and lullaby motif; emotional beats occasionally verge on sentimental without deeper psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with "soothing nightmares" twist but genre conventions (secret societies, chosen one) are present without radical subversion; prose remains clean but not distinctive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>All elements functional but few transcend their roles to create narrative transcendence; cohesive yet limited by need for greater emotional or philosophical depth.</comment>
