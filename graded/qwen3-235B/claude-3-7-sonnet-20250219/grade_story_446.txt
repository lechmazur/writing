<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character defined more by plot demands than depth; motivations are clear but under-explored. "Peaceful anger" is stated rather than demonstrated through behavior, and his transformation lacks psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Modest structural coherence with ledger as through-line, but pacing falters under word constraints. The significance of charity drives feels underdeveloped, weakening the long-game restoration arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details anchor the firefly-breeding marshland setting, but connections between atmosphere and character psychology remain superficial despite strong visual potential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical prose elevates the work, particularly in the petal-falling metaphor and ledger symbolism. Emotional resonance remains surface-level, with subtext hinted at but not fully realized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes in concept but occasionally stumbles into ornate phrasing that feels decorative rather than purposeful. Some character reasoning reads more schematic than authentically human.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Competent integration of elements suggests careful planning, but the story doesn't transcend its constraints to achieve lasting impact. Thematic ambitions exceed emotional execution.</comment>
