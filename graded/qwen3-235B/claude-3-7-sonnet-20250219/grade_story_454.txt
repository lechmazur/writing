<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mira's reckless nature is tied to action but lacks psychological depth; motivations are hinted but inconsistently embodied through limited introspection. Voice remains surface-level despite first-person framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tense countdown drives structure yet resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect between clover's symbolism and narrative arc exists but lacks payoff. Pacing prioritizes atmosphere over satisfying closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sensory details (eerie lights, creaking) establish mood but feel generic; haunted funhouse contrasts jubilant despair theme superficially. Setting's potential exceeds its functional use in plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Smashing clover as metaphor for fading luck creates thematic resonance; overlapping monologues as evaluative performance is innovative. Emotional depth implied rather than fully realized through showing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Haunted funhouse/tokens-of-fate tropes appear without subversion; some phrases ("contradictory emotion") verge on clich√©. Language avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic memorability amid competent but predictable phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly integrated; brevity feels restrictive rather than purposeful. The clover's role demonstrates creativity, yet overall execution lacks editorial polish required for top-tier publication.</comment>
