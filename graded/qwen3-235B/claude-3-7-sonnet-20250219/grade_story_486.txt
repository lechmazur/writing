<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (exposing corruption), but internal conflicts and emotional depth remain underexplored. The clumsily dexterous trait is stated but not deeply integrated into Marcus's psychology or decision-making</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses cohesively despite brevity, with cause-effect clarity in the mayor's downfall. Some narrative compression feels rushed (witch's influence, Marcus's backstory). Pacing balanced but lacks nuanced escalation</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Witch's cauldron room establishes mystical atmosphere, but sensory details feel generic (hanging herbs, candlelight). Stained glass fragment's symbolism is present but underdeveloped. Tone shifts unevenly between noir and magic realism</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Story successfully blends metaphor ("reality is consensus") with visceral action. Ending delivers thematic payoff about perception-altering power. Subtext about truth manipulation works, though some telling ("practical illusion") weakens impact</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing patterns but contains predictable tropes (witch mentor, cathedral decay). Phrasing occasionally veers into purple prose ("dance of clumsily dexterous fingers"). Metaphors (e.g., "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard") clever but insufficiently grounded</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Element integration is functional rather than inspired. Story feels constrained by checklist approach but maintains thematic consistency. Voice remains distinct if slightly melodramatic. Ending prompts reflection but lacks lingering ambiguity</comment>
