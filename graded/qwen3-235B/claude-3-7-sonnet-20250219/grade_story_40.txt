<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eliza's guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, but her internal conflict remains subtly sketched rather than deeply explored. The toy soldier and reincarnation concept shape her actions effectively, though her complexity as a "goldfish resurrection specialist" leans on whimsical premise over psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The plot achieves completeness through tight cause-effect logic: the weather triggers the leak, revealing the recipe, enabling the resolution. Pacing is impeccable within constraints, balancing backstory with present action while maintaining narrative momentum toward breaking the "fish-killing curse."</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eerie, rain-drenched atmosphere permeates the forgotten library setting, its sensory details (stained glass, creaking skylight, dripping recipes) enhancing both mood and thematic resonance of decay/renewal. The juxtaposition of culinary and aquatic elements creates a singularly haunting world.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through layered symbolism (soldier = failure/memento, recipe = redemption) and the subtext of mortality cycles. The ending's catharsis feels earned, with precise imagery (refracted light winking) elevating the thematic unity of broken curses and imperfect immortality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in merging goldfish mortality with culinary lore, avoiding total formulaic structure. While the "playful cynicism" motif risks repetition, the grandfather's anecdote and karmic debt metaphor introduce organic surprises. Language balances poetic precision against occasional overly ornate phrasing ("fishy ghosts").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements coalesce cohesively, with each assigned component shaping the narrative arc. The constrained length feels purposeful, leveraging tight focus to amplify emotional stakes. Lingers on bittersweet paradoxes of mortality and hope, leaving a resonant, quietly profound impression.</comment>
