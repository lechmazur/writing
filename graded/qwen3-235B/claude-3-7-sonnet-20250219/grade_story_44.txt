<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's feisty stability background surfaces in a single reference but lacks sustained integration; her intellectual playfulness is mentioned rather than demonstrated through action, creating a disconnect between stated traits and narrative embodiment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight cause-effect chain (ticket activation â†’ historical projection) drives cohesion; opening imagery of space debris art studio directly informs the artifact discovery, while the closing image of the glowing lamp creates a cyclical structure that satisfies within strict word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like the lamp's brass reflecting distant stars and the studio drifting into Earth's shadow create atmospheric depth; however, the orbital setting occasionally strains for poetic weight rather than functional worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Subtext about memory preservation elevates surface narrative; the glowing lamp's inner light as a metaphor for resistance works subtly. Ending feels somewhat abrupt, missing a final emotional beat that could transform good impact into great.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original concept execution (carnival tickets activating historical memories) avoids genre tropes; however, corporate memory purges and equine preserve remnants risk feeling like stock SF elements without deeper thematic exploration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Successfully interweaves complex elements without mechanical seams; the brief form feels intentional as the lamp's activation serves as a self-contained narrative while hinting at a larger preservation network, balancing completeness with suggestion of wider world.</comment>
