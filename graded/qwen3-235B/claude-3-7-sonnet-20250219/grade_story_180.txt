<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's remorse and quest for creativity are established but lack nuanced emotional depth; motivations align with actions but could benefit from deeper internal conflict exploration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., magic as connection) are effective but surface-level; decent emotional resonance but lacks layered subtext for deeper lasting impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes with unique imagery (shipwreck-greenhouse fusion); some ornate description borders on purple prose but doesn't detract significantly.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohesively interwoven; brief length highlights key moments but leaves thematic potential underexplored; evokes contemplation without feeling rushed.</comment>
