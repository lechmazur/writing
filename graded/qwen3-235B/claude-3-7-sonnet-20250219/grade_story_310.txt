<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (resisting historical erasure) is clear, but "wide-eyed" nature feels underutilized and disconnected from his hardened rebel demeanor. The lost voice effectively justifies silence-as-power motif, yet emotional depth remains surface-level in crucial moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc of action/reaction, though the 13-hour countdown device feels somewhat formulaic. Bulletin board sabotage executes cleanly but resolution through citizen whispers lacks narrative punch within the confined word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent Abyssia is vividly realized through precise sensory details (coral-carved boards, pulse-like clock tolls). Timeframe as "hour dividing bad habits and new starts" lacks thematic integration beyond gothic atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ending's metaphoric weight ("ability to make others remember their own voice") elevates the narrative. Subtext about silenced history resonates through show-don't-tell execution, though some emotional beats lean on poetic abstraction rather than earned visceral impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with silent rebellion/glass cannon strongholds. Weaknesses include "heartbeat" clock metaphor and occasionally over-polished phrases ("eternal ballet" of light/shadow) that undermine raw urgency. Tension feels algorithmically optimized rather than organically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements work cohesively but without electrifying originality. The brevity serves the stealth-activist plot well, though lingering impact would be stronger with more visceral character grounding in the final beats.</comment>
