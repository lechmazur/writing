<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's cold nature as both physical condition and temperament shapes his actions, but internal conflict between duty and fatherhood remains underexplored. Motivation (saving daughter) is clear but lacks nuanced emotional layering beyond surface-level determination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows retrieval mission structure effectively but resolution feels excessively condensed. The "lost mitten" motif ties beginning/end together well, yet the healing process lacks believable progression within the tight word limit, creating a rushed sense of closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Blends medieval/modern elements (knight with secret service agency) with intriguing tension, but the secret lab and altar settings remain underdeveloped. Atmospheric details (cold armor under streetlight, whispering herbs) are effective but sporadic rather than consistently immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Storytelling succeeds through symbolic connections (armored vulnerability, art-as-healing) but relies on some predictable emotional beats. The final line about "finding something more precious" feels somewhat trite compared to the more original earlier metaphors.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing clich√©s with unique concept blending, though "fragments of tradition" terminology veers toward New Age vagueness. The knight-artist redemption arc isn't entirely formulaic, but the folk remedy trope requires heavier subversion for top-tier originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere better than typical constrained writing but feel more assembled than organically integrated. The core theme of healing through creativity lingers, yet tonal balance shifts unevenly between espionage and sentimentality.</comment>
