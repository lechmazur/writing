<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but could use deeper exploration of Marcus's internal conflict; the joyless performer trait is effectively used but slightly surface-level in emotional depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong plot cohesion despite word limit; the action of organizing drives the story, though immersion through submersion lacks sufficient buildup for full emotional impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prismatic lake and construction setting create vivid atmosphere, but sensory details occasionally lapse into over-ornamentation without deepening character or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Uses symbolism (drawer knob, seesaw) effectively to explore guilt and identity; ending offers satisfying resolution but could enhance subtext by reducing overt references to "chaos" and "dissonance".</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids generic phrasing and maintains consistent tone; metaphors feel fresh but occasionally border on melodramatic (e.g., "tears cut channels through makeup"), diminishing emotional authenticity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elements (construction, drawer knob) are cohesively integrated; the brief length feels intentional, with the stone memorial scene leaving a lingering impression of redemption and renewal.</comment>
