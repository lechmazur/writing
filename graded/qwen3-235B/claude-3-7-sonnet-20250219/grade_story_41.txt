<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves a complete arc within the word limit but relies on abrupt tonal shifts; pacing falters in establishing the ritual's stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere mechanically but lack thematic synergy; strong moments exist but overall voice remains unevenly balanced between poetic and procedural.</comment>
