<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation and traits are clear, with the elegantly clumsy elevator repairman's ability to see ghosts driving the narrative. The ghost's brief characterization feels slightly underdeveloped despite touching emotional beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The plot has a complete arc within the constraint, but the connection between sand structure analysis and ghost resolution feels convenient rather than organic. Pacing maintains momentum but lacks nuanced tension development.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details create a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere with the sand castle lab and dissonant silence. The setting's timelessness through preserved sand sculptures meaningfully reflects thematic concerns of impermanence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The story effectively shows rather than tells through symbolic gestures and subtext. The central metaphor of preservation versus release resonates emotionally, though the ending could deepen its thematic punch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Writing avoids genre clich√©s with unique elements like the sand preservation science and flower crown as narrative device. While slightly self-conscious in places, the prose maintains individual style and emotional authenticity without veering into artificiality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story cohesively integrates assigned elements while maintaining literary quality. Though some required elements feel slightly peripheral, the brief format serves the theme of transience well through its condensed emotional structure.</comment>
