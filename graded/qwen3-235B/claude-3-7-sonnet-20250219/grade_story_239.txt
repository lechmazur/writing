<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Characters have surface-level dual roles but lack nuanced motivations; Margot's internal conflict between scientific rigor and artistic rebellion remains underdeveloped despite her secretive actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent with a closed arc between solitude and collaboration, but the pivotal transition feels rushed; the blackout's role as catalyst lacks sufficient causal buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details like trembling mirrors and luminescent liquid create a strong atmospheric tension; the tree ring setting as archive of hidden history enhances thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of encoded history and reality-perception duality show intellectual ambition; the ending's emotional payoff is underdeveloped despite strong metaphorical groundwork (light/shadow as truth-revealers).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains predictable dual-life tropes; the marriage of dendrochronology and illusionism feels inventive until superficial execution surfaces in dialogue's expositional weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere technically but lack organic synergy; the lunchbox/tools and zephyr/light interplay stand out, while "formally imperfect" remains a wasted literary opportunity.</comment>
