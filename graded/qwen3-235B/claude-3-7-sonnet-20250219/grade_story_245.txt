<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has distinct voice and emotional depth, but motivation's emotional logic feels slightly rushed. Physical manifestation of grief is poignant, yet the transformation from smuggler to devoted seeker lacks subtle psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively through symbolic action to revelation, but the ending feels slightly telegraphed. The tea leaf map revelation is clever, though the 500-word trajectory from cynic to believer strains credibility despite atmospheric momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through tactile details (cloud breath, prison-bar shadows), but the cyberpunk-meets-Eastern-mysticism setting remains conceptually underdeveloped. Sensory cohesion elevates, but doesn't fully contextualize, the sci-fi divination premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emotional impact derives from metaphorical resonance and reversal of fortune-telling trope, but relies heavily on familiar lost-love tropes. The rebellious heart symbolism works, though the "show don't tell" balance occasionally falters in exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Attempts freshness through genre blending (tea leaves in spaceport) but contains inconsistent tonal flourishes (e.g., "thundered to life" feels overwrought). Subtext about emotional repression is present, but the chopstick's symbolic weight borders on overly schematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but not always organically; the brief format sacrifices deeper exploration of existential smuggling-to-redemption arc. Lingering questions about Lira's intentions suggest intentional depth rather than execution.</comment>
