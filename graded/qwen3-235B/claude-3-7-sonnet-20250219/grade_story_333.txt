<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliza’s motivation as a preservationist is clear but underdeveloped; her “sincerity” is stated more than shown through layered actions. Her dialogue carries some distinct voice but lacks nuance in conveying complex emotion beneath the bitterness. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot is effectively driven by the sticky note’s coordinates and the ticking clock of the storm. Pacing is tight, though the ghost’s abrupt appearance and resolution feel slightly rushed despite maintaining internal logic and thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Atmospheric details like damp air, flickering light, and spectral whispers immerse the reader. The “constantly changing” shadows and passages enhance the haunted setting, while the timeframe between storms is meaningfully tied to plot mechanics (e.g., flooding risks).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of preservation vs. modernity resonates, supported by motifs of secrecy and tradition. Dialogue and sensory details bolster tension, but the subtext (e.g., fear as a tool for protection) could be more deeply woven through the narrative rather than explicitly stated in the ending.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The haunted academia trope is somewhat familiar, though the intentional architectural haunting offers a fresh twist. Some phrasing (“braided bitterness,” “spectral guardian”) veers into ornate abstraction. Emotional beats occasionally rely on direct statements rather than subtext or action.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive but slight, strained by its many assigned elements. The brevity works thematically but limits deeper exploration. The ending’s message is resonant but risks feeling pat rather than earned through narrative weight.</comment>
