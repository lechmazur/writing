<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Markus's transformation is present but occasionally clichéd, with motivations tied to redemption feeling slightly surface-level despite efforts to show internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Despite tight constraints, the plot maintains structural coherence, though the climactic confrontation feels slightly rushed compared to earlier atmospheric buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Electrified setting rendered with strong sensory detail, but deeper thematic integration between the garden's charged environment and Markus's emotional state remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerfully resonant ending delivers thematic weight through symbolic action rather than exposition, though some dialogue risks didacticism ("showing you who I never wanted to become").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés through unique setting, but the "redemption through apologies" trope gets conventional treatment; static garden concept elevates originality despite recognizable emotional arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All assigned elements are competently integrated, but museum meetings and rational subjectivity feel like puzzle pieces rather than organically evolved story components.</comment>
