<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elise's motivations as a forager are clear but underexplored; her "disinterested passion" lacks depth beyond surface dialogue. Henri's role feels tropically formal rather than nuanced. Interactions reveal ideological stakes but lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coherent arc from encounter to collaboration, but the rapid resolution of cultural clash feels contrived. Pacing manages the word limit but sacrifices tension development. The negotiation action drives the plot but lacks escalatory stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (limestone, chandeliers) establish mood, and the vault's historical setting contrasts with the science fair. However, the "living world" theme isn't physically embodied in the setting beyond dialogue.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dialogue-heavy execution of cultural preservation theme lacks subtextual complexity. The ending's neat synthesis ("bridge between worlds") feels forced rather than earned. Writing is competent but lacks stylistic memorability or poignant imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on contrast tropes (formal vs. casual). The champagne vault and science fair setting are original but underutilized. Emotional resonance relies heavily on stated conflicts rather than embedded subtext or characterization.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elements are functional but not synergistically indispensable. While the fragment and negotiation are essential, the science fair and champagne vault feel semi-arbitrary. The brief length exposes underdeveloped thematic potential rather than distilling it.</comment>
