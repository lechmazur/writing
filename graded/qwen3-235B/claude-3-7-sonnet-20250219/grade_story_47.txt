<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eliza's motivations (loyalty, desire for self-expression) are clear but could benefit from more nuanced internal conflict; her rapid transformation from shadow to spotlight feels underdeveloped despite effective use of the glove as a symbolic catalyst.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is mostly coherent, though the transition from voice notes to manuscript discovery could be smoother; the ending feels rushed despite strong thematic payoff, with cause-and-effect logical but compressed by word limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory detail in sanctuary's atmosphere and glove's tactile description; the "soundless" setting brilliantly amplifies emotional resonance, though connections between audition chaos and sanctuary stillness could be more visceral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Potent emotional impact through layered themes of legacy/death; clever use of symbolism (glove/memoirs) and dramatic irony; ending achieves satisfying transformation through elegant "shadow to spotlight" motif.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most clich√©s with raw memoir revelations and complex mentor dynamic; some reliance on "cryptic messages" trope; language precise but occasionally veers toward melodrama; emotional subtext strong despite minor instances of stating vs. showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story works within constraints to create cohesive arc; elements combine cleverly (e.g., "final laugh at mortality" motivating both plot and character); length enhances urgency but slightly dilutes emotional payoff of parentage twist.</comment>
