<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eliza's dual identity as overqualified academic and waitress is well-established, but her internal conflict could delve deeper; motivation to reinvent herself through lost faith feels clear yet slightly underexplored in terms of psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The autumnal timeframe and fireflies create organic momentum toward her epiphany; however, the transition from passive collecting of postcards to active reinvention feels slightly abrupt despite the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Autumn's sensory details and the ethereal fireflies create a melancholy-yet-magical atmosphere that mirrors Eliza's emotional state; the tavern's grime contrasts effectively with her intellectual refinement, though the fireflies' symbolic function borders on whimsical.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The story excels in metaphor (postcards as "portals," fireflies as guides) and thematic cohesion around transformation; the cyclical structure (falling leaves beginning/ending) amplifies the theme of renewal without feeling trite.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids obvious tropes through unique combinations (traveling library, chalk-on-postcards); some phrases ("bruised exhilaration") lean toward poetical abstraction, but the integration of intellectual struggle with magical realism feels organically human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>All elements work synergisticallyâ€”the tavern, postcards, fireflies, and chalk form a unified metaphor; story maintains density without sacrificing clarity, achieving poetic concision that lingers beyond its brevity.</comment>
