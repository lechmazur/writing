<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's traits (lazily ambitious, unmasked vigilante) are inconsistently realized—his passive motivations contrast oddly with deliberate actions, but the dental drill memory humanizes him.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tight structure through weather motifs and ritualistic routines; connection between opening imagery and closing "flow" theme feels earned despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting permeates every element—the fountains as decaying monuments mirror the stories' fragility; rain as temporal punctuation creates eerie, tangible atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (frozen copper children, "crystal lenses") deepen meaning; ending avoids sentimentality by grounding whimsy in tangible cultural preservation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Risk of "quaint eccentricity" trope subverted by visceral details (verdigris statues, leaking sinks), though rain-as-metaphor recurs slightly too mechanically.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coherence stems from thematic throughlines (preservation via minimal force), though some elements (vigilante past) feel underexploited for tension.</comment>
