<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eliza's duality as a secret projector is clear but lacks depth beyond plot function; motivations tied to legacy are consistent yet emotionally distant, with reactions to the key feeling perfunctory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pacing works for the word limit, but the abrupt shift from discovery to fleeing lacks tension; the cyclical return to home feels cohesive but underexploits rising action between revelation and resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival's decay and metaphysical whispers create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details like "rusted prayer" and "shadow fingers" deepen the liminal world, though sunlight/shadow mechanics at night strain logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors ("track spiraling toward the sky") and symbolic keys elevate the narrative, but emotional stakes remain abstract; grandmother's legacy lacks visceral urgency despite poetic imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Originality in weaving generational projection with metaphysical keys, but "unyielding compassion" feels tacked on, while phrases like "broken dreams" risk clich√©; tonal balance between mystical and human falters.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate efficiently to suggest deeper lore, but the story leans on genre conventions; concise format serves mystery but limits emotional investment in themes of survival and kinship.</comment>
