<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character is consistently portrayed through specific actions (planting, addressing the void) and clear motivation (defiance through nurturing). The voice feels authentic for a grieving widow clinging to memory, though some inner conflict could deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression from haunting to action to culmination, but compressed arc relies heavily on supernatural postcards as plot device. Pacing maintains momentum within constraints, though some transitions between past/future implications feel abrupt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is gorgeously rendered through precise sensory details - fog's movement, anvil's coldness, skeletal trees. The setting isn't just backdrop but active participant in narrative, enhancing the story's haunting quality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Eloquent metaphors (fertile soil amid desolation) and haunting imagery create lasting emotional resonance. The ending's "bridge worlds" postcard delivers thematic payoff while preserving mystery. Some dialogue feels slightly self-consciously literary rather than natural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through specific details (heirloom seeds, wet-ink postcards) that transcend ghostly romance tropes. Some phrases ("ancient gods," "solemnly absurd") flirt with abstraction, but overall maintains distinctive voice without veering into artificial lyricism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified whole where each component (meals, fog, forge) serves thematic purpose. The brief format enhances the story's haunting brevity, with final image of defiant creation leaving potent lingering resonance.</comment>
