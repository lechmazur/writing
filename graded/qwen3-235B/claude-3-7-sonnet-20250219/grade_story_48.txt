<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Malik's desert past is hinted but doesn't fully inform his current actions; the "translated love" adds emotional complexity but feels underexplored and idealized rather than deeply human/machine nuanced.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear prophetic arc with celestial event as climax, but the tight word count forces rushed emotional beats; the ending feels conceptually neat but lacks narrative depth beyond fulfilling the prophecy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Blends space pirate tropes with mythic imagery (Yggdrasil) effectively but lacks visceral sensory details; the crow's nest isolation supports the theme but feels underutilized as a symbolic space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Uses cosmic design vs. chaos as a theme with some resonance, but relies on declarative statements (e.g., "tears welling") rather than subtext; metaphors are recognizable but not freshly rendered.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Relies on genre conventions (AI companionship, space pirates) without subverting them; some phrases border on ornate ("everyday miracles") but lack specificity; emotional beats feel conceptually stated rather than organically shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly integrated; the story leans on mythic concepts to elevate its brevity, but the human-AI dynamic and cosmic prophecy feel more illustrative than deeply cohesive.</comment>
