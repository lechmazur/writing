<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing uneven – ritual climax feels underdeveloped while maze navigation over-explained; tight word limit strains cause-effect coherence between key plot points.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Successfully integrates complex elements into resonant whole, though certain time-spanning existential aspects remain underexploited within restricted word count.</comment>
