<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlow’s duality as a thief-turned-keeper is conceptually strong but underexplored; his poetry sessions reveal vulnerability but lack emotional depth. Winston’s role as a catalyst for introspection is intriguing but inconsistently tied to Marlow’s internal logic. Dialogue with an inanimate object stretches believability despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Narrative arc—a thief’s transformation via haunted poetry—is linear but structurally uneven. The impromptu poems intermittently stall momentum, while the lighthouse’s haunting feels underutilized as a catalyst. Pacing fluctuates between meditative interludes and abrupt revelations, creating tonal dissonance. The ending resolves the central conflict but weakens the story’s tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The claustrophobic engine room’s industrial decay and flickering lights masterfully evoke isolation. The dummy’s uncanny presence reinforces unease, though its agency (shifting hand, added lines) feels under-explained. Sensory details (salt air, mechanical hum) ground the setting, but the lighthouse’s “haunted” nature remains superficially sketched.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of poetic collaboration with a dummy as self-reclamation is striking; the line between Marlow’s and Winston’s voices blurs effectively. Emotional impact is softened by predictable “redemption” tropes. The final revelation about identity theft resonates, but subtext on human/automaton interdependence could deepen.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on hauntings and poetic catharsis as somewhat familiar devices. Prose is polished but occasionally veers into melodrama (“scorching poise”). Marlow’s introspective tone feels human, but the dummy’s agency lacks organic logic. Metaphors are evocative without revolutionizing the genre.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere but strain under literary weight. The dummy’s sentience and poetry-driven arc feel contrived yet purposeful. Theme of transformation is clear but lacks narrative teeth. The ending lingers without transcending expectations. Compact length works but amplifies pacing flaws.</comment>
