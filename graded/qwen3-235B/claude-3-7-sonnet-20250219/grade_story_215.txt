<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack emotional depth; Matthias' internal conflict is hinted at but underdeveloped. Dialogue feels stagy rather than revealing genuine personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually cohesive but rushed due to word constraints. Transitions between puzzle-solving and thematic revelations feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting attempts to fuse science and mysticism but relies on visual tropes (humming machines, glowing rooms) without deepening atmosphere through sensory complexity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (dance as synthesis) but leans on exposition for emotional beats. Ending lacks lingering resonance despite thematic intent.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Combines exorcism and psychic research with some originality but relies on predictable elements like hidden doors and artifact-filled chambers. Avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic distinction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are mostly integrated but feel utilitarian rather than transformative. The synthesis of themes is intellectually satisfying but emotionally muted.</comment>
