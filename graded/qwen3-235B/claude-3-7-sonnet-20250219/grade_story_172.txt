<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but thinly sketched; Mira's 'sharp gentleness' lacks emotional depth and evolution. Elias and Lena serve as plot devices rather than fully realized individuals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a predictable arc with logical gaps (e.g., rapid deciphering of symbols). The celestial alignment ties beginning to end, but pacing feels compressed and resolution overly neat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting has visual appeal but underutilized sensory potential; the shell's atmosphere contrasts with its supposed cosmic importance, undercutting immersion through insufficient tactile/spatial details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptually intriguing but emotionally restrained; reversed wishes offer thematic weight but execution leans on exposition over visceral impact. Ending resolves plot but lacks lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Detectable tropes (accidental hero, prophecy) without subversion. Some purple prose ("cosmic forces that would have torn reality apart"). Character reasoning remains surface-level despite demanding premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but not innovatively integrated; the story feels structurally competent rather than revelatory. The seashell's transformation hints at thematic payoff but remains underexplored.</comment>
