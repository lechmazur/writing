<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Wei's dual nature is conceptually strong, but motivations shift too abruptly without sufficient emotional groundwork. The "figuratively literal" emotion handling feels mechanically imposed rather than organically integrated into character logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints, but rushed progression from prep to resolution. The butterfly-driven prophecy plot relies on convenient leaps (soothsayer deciphering wing patterns) without explanation, weakening narrative logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting lacks cultural specificity beyond "ancient Chinese palace" tropes. Sensory details (jasmine, marble) establish vague atmosphere, but fail to deepen thematic resonance or character connections to environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Potent butterfly/metaphor interplay elevates themes of fate and agency. Over-reliance on expository internal monologue ("Curious how fate works") undercut subtlety, but concluding image of "hope" provides effective emotional closure.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Borrowed assassin-butterfly dichotomy gains freshness through prophecy manipulation, but phrases like "moved through the palace like a shadow" and "whispers of longing" exhibit AI-patterned phrasing. Emotional subtext remains surface-level despite thematic ambitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere logically but lack distinctive stylistic confidence. Tension between fate/change resonates, yet brevity sacrifices character depth and worldbuilding nuance critical for prestigious-tier literary impact.</comment>
