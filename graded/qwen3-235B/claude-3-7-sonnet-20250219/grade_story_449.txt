<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's awkwardness shapes his isolation and focus on work, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Dialogue is minimal but thematically relevant. Motivation explained rather than deeply embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end structure within constraints; sourdough/rising cosmos motif elegant. Pacing lags in middle exposition; abrupt transitions between cosmic scale and intimate details.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Time dilation observation deck vividly realized with precise scientific-poetic details (stars aging, bread baking). Tone occasionally loses tension between "haunting" and meditative atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (time=dough, storm=consciousness) resonate. Ends on philosophical elevation rather than emotional climax. Subtext about creation vs. celebrity underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of hard sci-fi and domestic metaphor avoids genre tropes. Sensory specifics (crackling glass, sourdough scent) counteract occasional abstract drift. No "purple prose"; style serves concept.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically (time dilation necessitates cosmic perspective; baking grounds theory in physicality). Leaves lingering questions about time's malleability rather than neat resolution.</comment>
