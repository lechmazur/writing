<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and tied to family legacy, but lack emotional depth beyond surface-level revelations; actions align with traits but could evolve more.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels rushed in key moments (e.g., sudden transformation of the gown); cause-and-effect is logical but lacks sufficient pacing nuance in tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly immersive (moonlight, crumbling columns, tactile gown) but verges on clich√©; setting enhances mystery but could deepen cultural specificity (Greek temple details).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Effective symbolism (gown tears as map, stamp gaps) and thematic resonance; emotional impact is undercut by over-explanation of themes and inconsistent "show, don't tell" application.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Innovative fusion of stamps, symphonies, and puppetry subverts tropes slightly, but tone occasionally slips into melodrama; some metaphors (e.g., "symphony of truth") feel unexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates assigned elements with purposeful connections; concise length amplifies tension but sacrifices secondary depth; ending lingers on thematic resonance.</comment>
