<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alaric’s exile establishes motivation but remains underexplored; his connection to the mortar feels more symbolic than psychologically layered. Interactions with the woman lack gradual development, undermining emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically via the storm’s catalyst, but the connection between grinding herbs and the woman’s entrance feels formulaic. The arc is complete yet slightly rushed, leaving the resolution’s impact muted.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured—cold, light, and decaying objects immerse readers. The customs office’s liminality mirrors themes of displacement, though the timeframe’s “key” metaphor remains vague.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Foreshadowing (e.g., mortar’s “gravity”) and the mortar’s symbolic role in shared human experience elevate the themes. The ending’s hopeful ambiguity and sparse, evocative dialogue resonate without over-explaining.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Some lyrical passages avoid cliché, but the snowstorm’s contrived timing and the “cure for loneliness” trope teeter on predictability. The mortar’s magic is understated yet refreshingly restrained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere but occasionally strain under their assigned nature (e.g., the timeframe’s awkward integration). The story lingers, though its brevity limits deeper exploration of the “familiar unknown” tone.</comment>
