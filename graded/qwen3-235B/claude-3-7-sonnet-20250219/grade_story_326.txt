<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (legacy/preservation) but internal conflict lacks depth; Elias' duality between illusion and fading magic is underexplored beyond surface melancholia</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot achieves structural completeness but relies on compressed exposition; the pivotal transformation of the fan feels abrupt despite earlier setup</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underground fairy city's sensory details are vivid and atmospheric, but the "cosmic possibility" timeframe feels abstract and disconnected from the grounded narrative</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively but lack transcendent integration; the concise format works well for the narrative arc but limits deeper thematic exploration</comment>
