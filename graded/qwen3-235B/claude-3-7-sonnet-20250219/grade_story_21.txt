<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fully aligned traits/actions, but lacks depth in showing transformation; motivations are clear yet underdeveloped in their psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but feels compressed; pacing uneven in moments, with ending feeling overly hastened despite thematic cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Meticulously layered sensory details enhance mood; decay of setting mirrors internal states while drum circles create potent ironic contrast.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (tassel, theater, drums) elevates theme; ending balances emotional resonance with philosophical weight on sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but contains traces of formal stiffness; genetic revenge angle offers freshness yet occasionally veers into predictable grief-to-vengeance tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohesively intertwine around revenge’s cost; tone/style support themes, though some contrived narrative bridges (e.g., data-decoding mechanics) slightly undermine plausibility.</comment>
