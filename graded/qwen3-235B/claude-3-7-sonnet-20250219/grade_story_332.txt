<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's solitary nature and artistic compulsion are clear, but motivations remain abstract, relying on poetic phrases rather than psychological depth. Nuanced hesitations present but insufficiently explored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tight arc from isolation to transcendent disappearance, with logical throughlines. Pacing compressed yet functional; resolution feels inevitable but under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric setting rendered with visceral sensory details—glowing nebulae, engineered flora, airlock's sterile chill. The garden's fragility contrasts with cosmic permanence, enriching thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imaginative metaphors ("cosmos from memory") and cyclical structure elevate impact. Ending resonates thematically but lacks visceral emotional punch. Dialogue spare yet meaningful; show-don't-tell mostly honored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis of space opera and artistic quest; avoids most clichés. Occasional ornate phrasing ("impossibly structured like brushstrokes") risks pretension. Subtle subversion of "mad artist" trope but under-explored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate elegantly: isolation enables creative transcendence. Story justifies brevity through poetic compression rather than constraint. Concludes with haunting conceptual resonance.</comment>
