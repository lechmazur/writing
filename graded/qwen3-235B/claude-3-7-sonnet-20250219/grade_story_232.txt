<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear motivation that aligns with actions and background, with medical knowledge driving plot integration, but lacks depth in emotional complexity; some elements feel archetypal rather than uniquely human.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherent arc in tight word count with logical cause-effect progression, though the concluding leap from finding patterns to immediately diving feels slightly rushed despite overall momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sufficiently detailed setting provides immersive sensory details and atmospheric tension, but the digital nomad camp's relevance feels superficial compared to deeper integration with character motivation or theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant use of metaphors (coffee grounds/coastline, veil between worlds) creates layered meaning; ending's thematic resonance and showing rather than telling elevate emotional impact beyond surface adventure trope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through medical-archaeology synthesis and coffee ground revelation, but contains minor purple prose tendencies in atmospheric descriptions that slightly undermine organic tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements interweave cohesively with narrative purpose, though some (camp setting) feel less essential; brief length achieves focused immediacy rather than limitation, prompting reflection on obsession and legacy.</comment>
