<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyric’s rogish nature and caution are consistently tied to his actions, but his internal motivations lack psychological complexity; his "voice" feels stylized but not deeply individualized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence hinges on the driftwood-to-music mechanism, which feels slightly schematic; pacing is efficient but the resolution lacks visceral cause-effect weight, leaning on poetic abstraction over narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (e.g., bioluminescent ink, kelp scrolls) immerse readers in Tideholm; the surface piano’s contrast with the underwater world is evocative but underexplored, slightly undercutting thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Linguistically precise metaphors ("space between notes") and layered subtext elevate the story’s impact; the theme of quiet rebellion is powerful, though the ending leans heavily on allegorical abstraction over emotional specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality in using driftwood as a symbolic medium stands out, but predictable thematic beats ("stagnant society") and occasional ornamental phrasing ("dancing ribbons") flirt with formula, lessening the cutting edge of subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>All elements cohere logically, but the surface piano’s inclusion feels more symbolic than narratively integral; the brevity is effective yet leaves undercurrents of tension underdeveloped.</comment>
