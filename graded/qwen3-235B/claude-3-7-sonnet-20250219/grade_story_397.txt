<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but overly compressed; Marcus' desperation and hope are hinted at but lack depth due to brevity, though his obsession with receipts and brother's scalpel reveals complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Logical progression from scalpel discovery to basement descent, but pacing feels rushed in spots; the arc is resolved thematically if not fully, with cause/effect mostly clear despite the tight frame.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystalline lab's unsettling beauty contrasts with New Year's celebration outside, offering effective visual and emotional texture; sensory immersion could be deeper, though.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Symbolism (crystals as memory, receipts as obsession) elevates theme; emotional resonance is undercut by abrupt emotional declarations rather than gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s with receipt-based clues and memory-erasure crystals, but global doodle pattern risks predictability; writing remains concise without purple prose, though some subtext feels thin.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements fit together logically but feel overstuffed; the short form sacrifices depth in character and worldbuilding; ends with lingering questions but lacks full thematic payoff.</comment>
