<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Abstract melancholy and reluctant duty are conceptually strong, but motivations lack concrete emotional grounding through actions or subtext; internal conflict is stated more than demonstrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Linear progression from prophecy to cosmic manipulation lacks intermediate stakes; pivotal moment of "rebalancing reality" hinges on underexplained metaphysical logic despite clear structural shape.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative lunar imagery present but underutilized; artificial gravity and distant Earth light create suitable disconnection, yet sensory details remain superficial rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors carry thematic weight (marbles as fractured futures, scoreboard as cosmic inequity); final scene's poetic orbiting gesture offers closure, though emotional resonance remains conceptual rather than immediate.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original cosmic reassembly premise intersects unusually with jigsaw puzzles and marbles; occasional abstract phrases ("unmake what has been wrongly made") border on pretentiousness but avoid full collapse into poetic excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements technically coexist without friction but rarely intersect inventively; final oath and cosmic motivation feel imposed rather than emergent; lunar setting adds texture but not structural necessity.</comment>
