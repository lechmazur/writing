<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited exploration of past life beyond caretaking role; motivation to communicate with animals is clear but lacks psychological depth; reactions to straw and forbidden logs hint at irony but insufficient inner conflict examination.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear beginning/middle/end structure with thawing climax, but pacing slightly unevenâ€”too much exposition on logs vs. emotional payoff; connection between anniversary and liberation is logical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Evocative geothermal/frost contrast establishes mood; sensory details (misty breath, melting circles) effective; tone of "gentle chaos" inconsistently maintained amid quieter reflective passages.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Poetic metaphors (straw as life-death symbol) elevate theme of interconnectedness; emotional undercurrents of redemption through listening feel authentic; ending balances hope with unresolved metaphysical questions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in combining spectral caretaker with disposable plastic; avoids overt horror tropes; occasional phrase stiffness ("mortal obsession") but overall maintains consistent lyrical voice without overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>All elements function cohesively; word limit constraints weaken thematic payoff in transition from isolation to reconnection; lingering questions about animal communication ethics add thoughtful resonance.</comment>
