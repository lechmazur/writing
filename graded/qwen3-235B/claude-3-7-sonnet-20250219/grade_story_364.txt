<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Decent articulation of Eleanor's eccentricity but underdeveloped secondary character dynamics; motivation is conceptually strong yet lacks psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plotted conceptually rather than through earned incident; resolution feels thematically satisfying but structurally passive - discovery happens to characters rather than through active pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies on exoticized mystery tropes; inconsistent sensory grounding - time-slipped objects lack tactile specificity despite vivid implications.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Potent metaphorical framework (time-bending flora) slightly undercut by heavy-handed thematic exposition; ending achieves symbolic resonance but lacks emotional gravity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt repetition but contains several artificial phrases ("mundane miracle", "cryptic clarity"); emotional insights are intellectually rather than viscerally conveyed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Successfully combines elements but often at surface level; thematic cohesion exists but lacks the transcendent layering required for top-tier publication.</comment>
