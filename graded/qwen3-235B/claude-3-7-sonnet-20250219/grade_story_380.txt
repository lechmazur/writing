<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Enzo's motivation to create thunder ties to his identity as a dream thief but feels underexplored; his math struggles inconsistently shape his character, and his actions lack nuanced psychological depth despite vivid internal monologue.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The plunge into dreamscapes drives the plot, but the rapid resolution of thunder’s return feels unearned; pacing balances exposition and action within constraints but lacks tension buildup.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere from the treehouse’s decaying setting and silent skies powerfully evokes isolation; sensory details like cracked photos and dry wind deepen immersion, though the timeframe’s societal context remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (thunder as lost vitality, fragmented dreams as self) add depth; the ending resonates emotionally but leans on poetic description over visceral character transformation, diluting impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but risks familiar "lone visionary" arcs; prose occasionally relies on abstract phrases (e.g., "quiet mania") over specific emotional rendering, bordering on lyrical excess without full payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements like the photo album and basketball-driven method suggests thematic intent, but some components (treehouse, math struggles) feel ambient rather than essential to the narrative’s momentum.</comment>
