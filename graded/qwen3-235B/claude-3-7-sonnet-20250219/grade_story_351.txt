<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character traits are stated but underdeveloped; "dreamy" quality inconsistently shown, rebelliousness lacks nuance beyond surface references. Motivation exists but lacks psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves logically through riddle-solving to revelation, but the word limit creates compressed cause-effect transitions and underexplored narrative beats that weaken momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric (ivy-covered station) with some visceral details, but sensory immersion remains superficial despite thematic connections to memory and decay.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor (sundial as memory-keeper) elevate the theme, but emotional resonance is diluted by abstract declarations rather than fully "shown" character reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar "forgotten archive" tropes. Language is occasionally ornate (e.g., "delicate undoing of forgetting") without deeper subtextual layers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements, but length forces superficial treatment of themes (memory, rebellion). Lingering impact exists, though diluted by narrative shorthand.</comment>
