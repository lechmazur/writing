<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and motivation (ascension through merging) is clear, but emotional complexity feels slightly underexplored. Subtle menace and nostalgia shape actions but lack layered psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but relies heavily on exposition. The method of merging via stitchwork is inventive, though the transition to transcendence feels abrupt despite logical framing. Pacing balances backstory and climax within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Steampunk mechanisms, storm sensory details, and the mirror's uncanny quality immerse effectively. The fusion of science and tailoring motifs strengthens atmosphere, though some descriptions lean toward generic ornamentalness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematic resonance between craft and science elevates the narrative. Symbolism (mirror as duality, stitching as bridge) is poignant. Ending achieves ambiguity while reinforcing the core concept, though emotional layers could deepen.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on "storm during pivotal moment" trope. The tailor-scientist duality offers freshness, though the confessional storm device borders on contrived. Technical jargon and metaphors feel balanced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a complete, evocative narrative. Tightrope between poetic prose and clarity maintained, with the ending lingering as a thematic fulcrum. Constraints of format are respected without sacrificing complexity.</comment>
