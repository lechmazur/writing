<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weakly defined voice; motivations tied to obsolescence anxiety are clear but lack nuanced psychological depth despite the premise.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot progression follows logical cause-effect but feels compressed; resolution arrives abruptly without earned emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere established through sparse desert imagery but underdeveloped; sensory details remain superficial rather than immersive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere but lack artistic daring; premise suggests depth that execution doesn't fully realize within the constraint.</comment>
