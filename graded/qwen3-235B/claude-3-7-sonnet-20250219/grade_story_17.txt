<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eliza’s motivation for self-forgiveness is clear and drives her final decision, but her transformation feels slightly underexplored despite her nuanced internal conflict and distinctive first-person voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tight word limit successfully establishes a beginning (her work), middle (her decision), and end (redirecting her skills). The plot’s cause-effect logic (e.g., guilt → action) is strong, but the pacing slightly compresses her emotional arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (black light, chipped bowl, cemetery walks) create a moody, tactile atmosphere that reinforces her hidden life, ethical duality, and symbolic ties to fragmented identities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., the chipped bowl as resilience, dissolving names as symbolic cleansing) deepen themes of fractured identity and redemption. The ending feels purposeful, though some emotional beats lean on direct statement rather than subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original concept (black-market genealogist) avoids cliché, with precise, specific details. Writing style is crisp but occasionally leans on slightly over-ornate phrasing (e.g., “witch’s brew of identities”). Emotional resonance mostly shown, not just told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Cohesive despite tight constraints; elements like the chipped bowl and cemetery walks are integral. The story’s theme of fractured duality resonates beyond the surface narrative, leaving a lasting impression.</comment>
