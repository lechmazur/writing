<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters show clear motivations but lack depth; Miguel's actions align with his reverence but emotional complexity is surface-level, while the professor's "diligently whimsical" trait feels assigned rather than organically developed through nuanced behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically but feels rushed; the sudden confession about closure lacks buildup, the plan for dusk feels underdeveloped, and the compressed format prevents deeper exploration of rising tension or resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively contrasts the temple's sacred history with its modernized state through limited but vivid details (e.g., wind, shadows, shovel sounds), though sensory immersion could be more sustained to deepen the setting’s emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Story evokes mild emotional resonance through metaphoric moments (e.g., "overlapping worlds") and symbolic ending, but relies partially on stated emotions; writing style balances poetic intent with clarity, though not all literary devices land with impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phrases like "raucous silence" and "kindrelize" feel forced, while motifs such as "shovel as heartbeat" lean into cliché rather than freshness; subtext is thin, and the narrative occasionally prioritizes concept over organic character or setting development.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Story is mostly cohesive but strains under the weight of required elements; themes of cultural preservation and tradition vs. progress are clear but underexplored; the brief length accentuates gaps in nuance, though it ends with a reflective tone that hints at lingering emotional stakes.</comment>
