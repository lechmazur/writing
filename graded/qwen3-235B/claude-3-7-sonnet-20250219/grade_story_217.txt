<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Predictable motivations; rebellion lacks organic grounding. The knife reveals minimal about her character. Gold-toothed designer has underdeveloped backstory. Relationships form too rapidly without emotional escalation. Dialogue lacks distinct voices or psychological nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end within the constraint, but pacing falters at midpoint. The inexplicable phone call feels contrived rather than earned. Key revelations occur too swiftly without narrative buildup. Conclusion lacks narrative punch despite thematic clarity. Causal chain relies on coincidence rather than character-driven momentum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</comment><grade></grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through precise sensory details—peeling paint as "dead skin," mechanical ghosts, fog-laden air—but occasionally veers into overly decorative description. The juxtaposition of beauty/decay effectively frames moral questions about preservation vs. change. Setting supports theme but doesn't actively shape character decisions beyond aesthetic ambiance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is clear but didactic rather than subtly woven. Metaphor of adaptation shows promise but executes unsubtly. The noodle-sharing scene attempts emotional connection but feels schematic. Final image of blueprints in pre-dawn light offers strong visual closure. Lacks fully realized secondary conflicts to deepen thematic engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong set of specific, unexpected details keeps prose from formulaic structures. Some phrases risk preciousness ("sadly joyful tone as the haunted house's faded murals") but rarely repeat. Emotional beats avoid pat resolutions; the ambiguous "waiting" ending resists easy closure. Dialogue restraint prevents artificiality despite philosophical themes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but execution occasionally prioritizes poetic description over narrative momentum. The brevity feels limiting rather than purposeful—key developments require longer incubation. Combines familiar tropes (wise old mentor, solitary rebel) with original elements (haunted house as adaptive space) to moderate effect. Leaves thematic questions rather than emotional imprints.</comment>
