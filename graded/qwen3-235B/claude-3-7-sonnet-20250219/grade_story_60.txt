<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character shows depth through actions and artifacts, but interiority remains slightly opaque despite purposeful symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; pacing falters slightly during artifact arrangement before regaining momentum in the mystical resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory immersion excels with damp stone, bell tolls, and pulsing light; time pressure from "between bells" concept enhances atmosphere but could be more viscerally integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elegant symbolism in objects-as-offerings and ribbon's transcendence; resolution lacks slight emotional crescendo that might elevate transcendence to sublime.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps with tactile mysticism; metaphors earthbound yet evocative; emotional subtext implied through gesture rather than declaration.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with thematic purpose; brevity enhances elegiac tone; ending lingers but sacrifices full catharsis for narrative economy.</comment>
