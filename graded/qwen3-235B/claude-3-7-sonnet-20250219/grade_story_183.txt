<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés, but phrases like "pathways of contradiction" and the mosaic’s mystical properties risk overused poetic abstraction over authentic originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>All elements integrate thematically, creating cohesion and depth, though prose occasionally overelaborates, slightly marring clarity and urgency.</comment>
