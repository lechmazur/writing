<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation to restore carousel is clear but inner conflict and growth feel superficial. Emotional stakes remain underdeveloped despite nostalgic framing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows logical arc but transitions between decoding tapestry and mechanical innovation feel overly coincidental. Pacing stumbles under word constraints during pivotal revelations.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Contrast between alpine monastery and desert landscapes is evocative, but atmospheric details (scent of aged tapestry, texture of tongs) remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of resilience and heritage resonate, but emotional impact is diminished by explicit "hand on shoulder" ending. Shows more than tells but lacks subtlety in symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on "ancient wisdom solves modern problem" trope without sufficient subversion. Language is purposeful but occasionally veers into sentimentalism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elements cohere more through narrative convenience than organic design. The story satisfies prompts but lacks the transcendent cohesion demanded by prestigious literary markets.</comment>
