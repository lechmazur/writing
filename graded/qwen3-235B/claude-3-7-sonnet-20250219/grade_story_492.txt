<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eliza's traits of distraction and mathematical fixation are consistent and shape her actions, but emotional depth and internal conflict remain underexplored. Her motivation to restore fragmented memories is clear, yet feels slightly surface-level compared to the nuanced potential of her grandfather's lessons or her own past stagnation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mission structure is clear but feels compressed; cause-effect links exist but momentum lacks urgency. The infiltration action drives the plot effectively, yet pacing struggles with the word limit, leaving some transitions (e.g., escalator pause) feeling disconnected from the story's core tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Neo-Shanghai's neon-drenched alleys and mechanical fossils create mood, but descriptions lean on generic cyberpunk tropes. Sensory details (burnt circuitry smell, server hum) are present but lack visceral specificity to fully immerse readers in the setting's unique contradictions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (memories as caged birds, servers as beehives) show promise. The central theme of reclamation resonates, but emotional weight relies too heavily on explicit statements ("ruthless kindness") rather than subtext through nuanced action or atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Some fresh contrasts (analog tools vs digital chains) but risks formulaic storytelling with "dystopian rebel" tropes. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate simplicity ("digital birds") rather than distinctive voice; emotional depth often told rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally serve the story cohesively, particularly blacksmith tools as symbolic devices. The tight length works for a vignette but limits psychological and thematic exploration. The ending's hopefulness lingers, though broader implications remain underdeveloped.</comment>
