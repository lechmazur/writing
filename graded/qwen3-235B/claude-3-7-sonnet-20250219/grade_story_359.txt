<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are defined by their respective crafts and struggles, but motivations occasionally border on surface-level. Eleanor's 'intimate detachment' is conceptually intriguing but thinly fleshed; Martin's arc is resolved with slight narrative haste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Limited word count necessitates compressed pacing, yet the narrative maintains a coherent arc. The encounter at the station acts as the pivotal hinge well, though the competition's outcome and apprenticeship resolution feel slightly perfunctory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-AI setting effectively contrasts mechanical efficiency with human craft. Sensory details (sound of traditional brewing) and symbolic objects (lion knocker) are vivid, though environmental descriptions could deepen further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evokes emotional resonance through themes of impermanence and human connection. The motif of irreplaceable human artistry is poignant, though some thematic assertions lean toward overt rather than subtly inferred messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major formulaic pitfalls; the AI-revolution framework isn't overly clichéd here. Dialogue remains natural, though Eleanor’s role as archivist occasionally feels slightly contrived rather than organically integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Story cohesively incorporates numerous required elements, occasionally sacrificing nuance for structural efficiency. The bittersweet ending lingers, though the brief format occasionally strains thematic depth.</comment>
