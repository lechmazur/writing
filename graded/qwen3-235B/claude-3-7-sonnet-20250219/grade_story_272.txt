<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (regret, redemption) is clear but social awkwardness lacks nuanced demonstration through action; actions align with motivation but voice remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows logical arc within constraints; reversed trails method drives decryption climax. Pacing avoids rush/drag. Resolution tied to sunrise metaphor effectively closes loop despite brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Eerie diner atmosphere with sensory details (buzzing lights, melancholy jukebox) seamlessly merges with theme of merging past/future. Setting actively fuels tension rather than decor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Emotional resonance through tactile objects (tears on whistle) and symbolic sunrise. Subtext about eroded human knowledge persists beneath surface narrative. Ending feels earned, not formulaic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s in core concept but contains occasional over-explaining ("tree of regret"). Sensory details specific but some emotional conclusions (regret lifting) explicitly stated rather than shown.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements function symbiotically (whistle decryption enabling archive access enabling redemption arc). Brief length leveraged for thematic focus on pivotal transformation moment rather than limitation.</comment>
