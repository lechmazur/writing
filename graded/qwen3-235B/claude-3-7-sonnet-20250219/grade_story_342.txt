<question>1</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Superficial character traits; carelessness lacks integration with archivist motivation. Dialogue is sparse but attempts distinct voice. Borrowed memories add depth but feel imposed rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear beginning-middle-end but reliant on contrived plot devices (postcards, instant revelations). Pacing collapses under time jumps and memory intrusions. Connection between pilot error and archival calling feels unearned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensory details (wet bark, thunder) immerse effectively but setting remains backdrop rather than active force. Atmosphere supports "dreamy" tone, but labyrinth logic feels underdeveloped beyond visual descriptors.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Some striking metaphors ("pulse of flight paths") but lacks emotional authenticity. Theme of natural pattern preservation is stated rather than demonstrated. Ending offers spiritual awakening without narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overly polished prose lacks risk-taking; "ancient oaks," "living wood" trope feels recycled. Synesthesia of shifting patterns is fresh but derivative of magic-realist traditions. Reliance on atmospheric vagueness masks shallow conflict.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elements present but unevenly weighted; postcards and memories dominate while glove/setting underutilized. Word constraints expose structural fragility. Lingering impression of poetic surfaces over narrative substance.</comment>
