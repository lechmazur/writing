<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Characters serve thematic roles but lack psychological complexity; Elias’s mechanical arm ties to guilt, but motivations remain intellectualized, with limited emotional vulnerability to humanize the philosophical framework.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc within constraints, but the climax feels abrupt; the connection between deconstructing arguments and reality-warping is conceptually coherent but underdeveloped due to word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s decayed grandeur and sensory details (whirring arm, chalk equations) evoke melancholy and intellectual decay, though the applause-as-timeframe element feels loosely integrated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity linking paradox, symbolism, and existential themes; the sock’s duality and shifting equilibria provoke thought, though emotional resonance is unevenly balanced against abstract ideas.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but leans on "secret legacy" tropes; metaphors like the sock are inventive, though the mechanical arm’s symbolic weight occasionally strains toward contrivance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively into a speculative whole, but the brevity forces simplification of complex ideas; the ending satisfies thematically but risks feeling like a placeholder for a larger narrative.</comment>
