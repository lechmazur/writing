<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Character's traits drive actions (unruly alchemy, haunting cheer) but deeper motivations (why he fixates on cosmic dialogue) remain underexplored despite consistent behavior. Voice lacks distinctiveness in narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action (impressing colleagues) drives structure, pacing is tight but feels slightly rushed in resolution. Timeframe between innings cleverly ties beginning/end, though cosmic projection's mechanics require more explanation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Eerie, nostalgic atmosphere through sensory details (crackling radio, humming projector) and abandoned setting. The shooting star tracking station feels vital to his isolation and scientific disillusionment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (cracked lens revealing truths) and subtext about rigid institutions stifling discovery create resonance. Ending feels purposeful, balancing wonder with thematic coherence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original in combining alchemy with astronomy; avoids most clich√©s. Some overly ornate phrases ("stellar formations danced") but emotional restraint and specific details (baseball game as temporal anchor) elevate authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All assigned elements are tightly integrated into plot, theme, and setting. Story feels like a deliberate vignette rather than constrained, leaving lingering reflection about creativity and perception.</comment>
