<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character's mechanical nature shapes precise sorting method; motivation to recover lost words connects logically to creator's unspoken apology. Slight underdevelopment in showing evolution from machine to emotional being.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Linear progression through fragment gathering has clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing lags in middle sections. Cause-and-effect connections remain logical despite compressed timeframe.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (luminous leaves, humming joints) create palpable atmosphere. Underground river of starlight and repulsively attractive setting enhance narrative's uncanny tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evokes paradoxical emotions through juxtaposed imagery (joy/sorrow, machine/human). Ending feels both inevitable and haunting, with effective metaphor usage throughout. Subtext about silence as historical artifact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original combination of sci-fi and poetic elements avoids genre tropes. Some ornate phrasing ("bittersweet electricity") borders on purple prose but serves thematic purpose. Emotional depth emerges through symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically despite high concept density. Limited word count focuses on emotional crescendo rather than constraint. Lingering questions about creator ethics elevate beyond literal narrative.</comment>
