<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eliza's arc from bitterness to revolutionary resolve is clear but slightly rushed; motivations are consistent (librarian's duty vs. personal vendetta) but nuance in her transformation could deepen.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plotted with mechanical precision; the sticker-revelation-package structure is tight, but compressed format leaves some transitions (e.g., decoding mixtapes) feeling underelaborated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid steampunk atmosphere enhances theme of knowledge preservation amid decay; brass pipes, hissing steam, and automatons evoke both wonder and oppression.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ending resonates with thematic weight; the juxtaposition of "keeper of truth" and mechanical clock symbolism elevates it beyond plot; subtext about historiography and forgiveness is profound.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Original twist on redemption through discovered evidence; avoids clich√©s with mixtapes-as-codes, but occasional ornate phrasing ("savage grace") risks melodrama.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements (e.g., stickers as physicalized past tensions); tone and theme hold despite constraints; conclusion lingers as a societal reckoning metaphor.</comment>
