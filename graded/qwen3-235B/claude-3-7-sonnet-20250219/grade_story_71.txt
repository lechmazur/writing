<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Characterization leans on premise but lacks psychological depth; internal conflict stated but underdeveloped through action or subtext.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Structurally functional with clear temporal progression, but the battle's rapid resolution and deus ex machina return of Elspeth undermine tension investment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sensory details are superficial (e.g., "air shimmered" without visceral texture); worldbuilding remains decorative rather than immersive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Metaphorical parallels (fan → rapier, fractured earth → dimensional instability) demonstrate conceptual cohesion, but emotional stakes remain intellectualized rather than viscerally conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Avoids outright cliché recycling but falls into genre-typical patterns with "guardian against unknowable forces" and VR battle tropes. Style occasionally veers toward mannered descriptions with phrases like "crystalline spears."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent execution of genre elements but lacks distinctive literary personality to elevate beyond competent genre fiction. Maintains narrative unity but pursues ideas rather than emotional truth.</comment>
