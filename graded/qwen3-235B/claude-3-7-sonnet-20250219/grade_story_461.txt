<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Main character's anger feels authentic but motivation to reject exploration for domesticity resolves too abruptly. Dialogue voice is distinctive but interiority lacks gradual emotional evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elegant three-act structure within constraints. Flashback device bridges character past/future concisely. Time compression feels slightly rushed but pivotal beats connect cause-effect clearly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rich initial sensory details (calligraphy labels, dust, translucent wings) establish eerie atmosphere but emotional resonance diluted by occasional vagueness in setting contrasts (study vs childhood bedroom).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (dragonfly wings for fragile connections, meditation rhythm mirroring heartbeat) elevate narrative. Subtext about intergenerational trauma/resolution conveyed masterfully. Ending achieves catharsis through cumulative symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through psychological depth over supernatural spectacle. Some phrases ("manipulative old bat") verge on archetypal but emotional authenticity in dialogue/dialogueless scenes prevents formulaicity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically - static study frames emotional stasis, pendant enables thematic generational dialogue. Story's brevity highlights narrative precision rather than limitation. Haunting meditation on belonging through lineage.</comment>
