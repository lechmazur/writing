<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is whimsically unique but lacks psychological depth; motivation is clear but underdeveloped; the juxtaposition of chef/seismologist is conceptually strong but insufficiently realized through actions and consequences</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot is efficiently structured with cause-effect clarity, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt within the constrained word limit; the connection between beginning/end is logical but could benefit from more textured development of stakes</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting contrasts modern and ancient elements effectively, but sensory details are unevenly distributed; the earthquake facility's atmosphere is intriguing but under-imagined beyond superficial technological descriptions</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Compelling metaphorical interplay between cooking and science; evokes philosophical questions about lost knowledge; subtextual layers (modernity vs. antiquity) are thoughtfully woven; ending delivers thematic resonance despite brevity</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s through inventive premise blending; some descriptor choices border on ornate but generally purposeful; emotional states are shown through objects/actions rather than stated; tone consistent with few algorithmic markers</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fits assigned elements cohesively but prioritizes novelty over profound character exploration; length is both a constraint and deliberate framing device; lingers as an intriguing speculative concept rather than emotionally transformative narrative</comment>
