<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation feels partially realizedâ€”loyalty as a scout isn't fully integrated with his deeper mission-driven actions, and grief over Marissa's death lacks visceral emotional texture. His meditation practice is underdeveloped as a coping mechanism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tight structure connects Marissa's clues to Elias's realization, but the abrupt moth-formation revelation feels slightly contrived. Pacing works within the word limit but lacks organic tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere leans on moths-as-symbol but fails to richly detail the tower's physicality or the blackout's societal implications. Sensory details are minimal beyond visual motifs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (moths mirroring human collectivism) contrast with heavy-handed plotting (literal arrow-shaped swarm). Ending hints at moral transformation but lacks layered thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Relies on conspiracy tropes (coded comedy routines, Illuminators-style activism) without subverting expectations. Writing style avoids purple prose but stumbles into clinical detachment rather than emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</comment>  
</grade><comment>Elements like the journal and moth patterns are tightly integrated, but the tower's purpose and blackout's causes remain shallow. The premise lingers conceptually but lacks narrative cohesion.</comment>
