<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's eccentricity and burden of leadership are well-established but psychological depths remain underexplored; motivations align with plot yet lack visceral emotional grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements synergize with thematic intent but uneven emotional texture prevents transcendent cohesion; brief format serves contemplative tone better than action-driven development.</comment>
