<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias's mechanically intuitive mind and role as a guardian are consistent, but depth in emotional nuance is lacking. His dialogue and dice-based knowledge encoding align with his traits, yet reactions occasionally feel transactional rather than organically motivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dice-driven revelation and emulated equations propel the plot, but the brisk 500-word arc leaves the terraformer threat underdeveloped. Coherence holds thanks to the schoolhouse's orbital map payoff, though the final image of Elias as a "bridge" feels abrupt despite clever circularity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The retro-futuristic diner's prismatic neon and antique salt shakers juxtaposed with hover-pods create potent visual and tactile contrasts. Sensory details (real potatoes, cracking vinyl booths) immerse readers, with "organized disorder" palpable in both equations and atmospheric decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dice-as-archival-system metaphor elevates surface plot, while the orbital map resolves tension elegantly. Subtext about knowledge-as-living-pattern resonates, though some "he felt" constructions dilute emotional impact. The ending's transformation moment feels earned through accumulated detail.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by encoding indigenous wisdom in mathematical patterns. No purple prose; the diner's "retrofitted neon" and "spider's web data crystal" offer fresh imagery. Corporate terraformers could descend into caricature but remain effective as faceless antagonists without overcomplication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around preservation-as-resistance theme, though the schoolhouse's orbital functionality feels slightly contrived. The brief format serves the urgency but leaves Mei's constellation salt shakers underexplored as symbolic motifs. Lingering resonance comes from metaphorical dice mechanics.</comment>
