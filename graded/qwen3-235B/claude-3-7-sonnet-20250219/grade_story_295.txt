<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation is broadly clear (sister's memory drives vengeance/doubt) and consistent with jovial/reluctant traits, but lacks psychological depth; Galen's internal conflict remains sketched, not fully rendered.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot moves logically from ritual setup to resolution with celestial timing, creating completeness in tight arc; pacing is efficient but occasionally glides over emotional weight required for character transformation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting immerses through vivid sensory integration (whispering plants, sage smell); atmosphere enhances theme of transformation, though some connections between objects (telescope/time capsule) and witch's magic could be more explicit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Uses symbols (loved one's hair, time capsule) to convey doubt-to-purpose arc; emotional impact diluted by reliance on declarative statements ("weight of purpose") rather than fully embodied subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality in tying celestial mechanics to emotional vows, but genre tropes (witch's garden, cursed heirlooms) remain largely unchallenged; some ornate phrasing borders on purple prose without disrupting coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements are competently integrated with minor seams showing; the brief form doesn't fully explore thematic tensions between tradition and transformation, though it provides satisfying narrative closure.</comment>
