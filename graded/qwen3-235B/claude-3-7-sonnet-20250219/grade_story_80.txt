<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character is a troped "mad genius" with sparse depth; traits inform action but lack nuanced motivation or emotional subtext. Reactions to the doorknob are functional, not revelatory.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but rushes the roller coaster’s transformation, weakening cause-effect logic. The riddle’s resolution feels abrupt despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details immerse readers in decay and mystery. The abandoned roller coaster’s fusion with cosmic machinery amplifies the eerie tone effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor elevate the story, with the celestial calculator projecting profound themes. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks emotional catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Trope reliance (haunted attractions, arcane knickknacks) undermines originality. The "quiet mania" and cosmic scope show flair, but log-based clues feel algorithmically contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weaves elements cohesively but strains under the word limit. Atmosphere and concept linger, though underdeveloped character arcs and plot mechanics limit impact.</comment>
