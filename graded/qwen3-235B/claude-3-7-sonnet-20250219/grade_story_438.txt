<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Chronicler's vagueness sacrifices depth; Dr. Vega's revelation feels rushed. Motivations exist but lack emotional complexity. Dialogue serves plot over character nuance. </comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Arc exists but relies on convenient exposition. Cause/effect between Polaroids and DNA decoding feels underdeveloped despite logical premise. Pacing stumbles through exposition. </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cold lab contrasts mysticism effectively, but sensory details remain superficial. Contracting universe setting isn't fully exploited for atmospheric tension. </comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lyrical science-poetry tension works, but metaphors (compass, horizons) lack subtext. Theme resonates slightly beyond surface story. Ending ties conceptually but lacks emotional payoff. </comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with DNA-as-legacy angle, though Polaroid device borders on whimsical. Language balances poetic against clinical without excess. "Hollow recklessness" provides unique tonal contrast without feeling artificial. </comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cohesive but derivative in execution - combines mystery and science tropes without sufficient reinvention. Leverages constraints effectively but leaves ideas underexplored. </comment>
