<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character background is established but lacks psychological depth; motivation for obsession feels inadequately earned despite surface-level justification through trauma and fame collapse.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative progression is logical but predictable; tight word constraints limit character arc development; resolution remains ambiguous without satisfying payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively combines clinical technology and mystical obsession through sensory details, but cathedral setting could use more vivid cultural/historical grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity through recurring symbols (faded ink, vibrations); ending maintains tension between redemption and delusion, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Mix of fresh concepts (vibrational archaeology) and overused tropes (fallen child star, mystical Spanish cathedrals); prose occasionally veers into melodrama but maintains stylistic consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Competent execution of a genre-blending premise with thematic cohesion, but lacks the transcendent insights or narrative boldness required for elite publication.</comment>
