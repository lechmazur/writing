<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s uncertainty and "uniquely common" magic shape her actions, but her internal shift from apathy to purpose feels somewhat rushed without deeper exploration of her emotional turning point.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot coherence falters slightly in the abrupt transition to auditions and underdeveloped library hours timeframe, though the thematic arc from obligation to self-actualization anchors the structure effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>New Arbor’s neon-drenched, fragmented tech-nature hybrid atmosphere is evocative and thematically resonant, though missed opportunities to explore sensory contradictions between organic and synthetic elements prevent higher impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity in juxtaposing druidic wisdom with technological decay; the subtext of harmony in chaos is elegantly shown through spore-induced hybrid holograms rather than stated, delivering emotional resonance within constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids AI clichés through specific, inventive worldbuilding (embedded moss in a lunch tin) and subtle character nuance (herbs as legacy vs. tools), though minor instances of generic phrasing ("pulsed with rhythm") slightly undercut originality.</comment>
