<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's late-blooming heroism is clear but underexplored; motivation through cosmic balance feels superficially tied to heirloom object. Internal conflict remains surface-level despite environmental pressures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot maintains coherence through object-driven inciting incident but leans on predictable post-apocalyptic tropes. Ending feels compressed rather than earned within word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid post-apocalyptic details immerse readers, but integration between setting and character psychology lacks nuance. Rooftop farm's ingenuity overshadows ecological plausibility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolic use of spyglass and effective melancholy-laced hope. Underdeveloped subtext about survivor guilt vs. leadership potential limits emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids total formulaicity through specific sensory details but relies on familiar apocalypse frameworks. Prose occasionally slips into AI-esque abstraction ("architecture of cosmic balance") rather than authentic introspection.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Functional cohesion achieved through strong object-centered throughline but lacks narrative audacity. Elements serve story adequately without transcendent synergy.</comment>
