<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Relies on magic-art trope without subversion; "gifts of the fog" and pen’s effects verge on cliché; prose avoids purple patches but occasionally becomes overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coexist but don’t synergize; brevity hinders thematic depth; story hints at larger ideas without fully realizing them.</comment>
