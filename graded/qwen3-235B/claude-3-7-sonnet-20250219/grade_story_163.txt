<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation as a lost heiress drives her initial actions, but her emotional complexity remains surface-level; "bitterly optimistic" manifests in dialogue but lacks nuanced behavioral justification beyond plot conveniences.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot achieves circularity (parking stub to transcendence), but the detour feels contrived and pacing stumbles during exposition dumps; cause-effect logic holds despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, alien-specific sensory details (bioluminescence, "atmospheric fish") and the observation deck's purposeful design immerse readers, with tone complementing metaphysical themes through stark contrasts between sterile corridors and cosmic beauty.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Transcendent ending elicits awe, but emotional impact is diluted by underdeveloped maternal backstory; effective use of symbolism (clouds as liminality) and thematic coherence around bridging divides, though heavy on "show" while occasionally slipping into "tell."</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Occasionally leans on "sentient cloud" tropes without deep subversion; avoidable phrasing like "shattered into fragments" borders on cliché, while Eliza's voice remains distinct but formulaically defiant; sufficient originality in merging consciousness-as-migration metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements work collectively but unevenly—parking stub integration is genius, detour contrivance glaring; length serves the narrative yet sacrifices deeper exploration of inherited legacy themes; lingering awe from the cloud fusion outweighs minor structural flaws.</comment>
