<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stoic demeanor effectively shapes character, but motivation lacks nuance beyond surface plot. Emotional layers remain underdeveloped despite clear stakes. Instructor's blandness feels more symbolic than integrated into meaningful character growth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Beginning-to-end trajectory works within constraints, but abrupt resolution weakens character dynamics. Pacing balances urgency and reflection, though cause-effect connections between erased symbols and floorboard's power remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere blends mysticism with subtle dread through tactile details (chalk absorption, metallic feathers), but the training ground's unique qualities feel conceptually generic rather than deeply tied to story mechanics. Familiars lack distinctive presence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Central tension between imposed knowledge vs. earned truth resonates emotionally. Dialogue avoids exposition while maintaining thematic weight. Ending's payoff feels earned but undersells the cyclical tragedy of erased histories through overly polished resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar fantasy scaffolding (magical instructors, ancestral grudges) without radical reinvention. The "trail of nightmares" concept hints at originality but reads more as a plot device than uniquely personal metaphor. Language occasionally veers into decorative abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a coherent narrative with distinct emotional core, though thematic depth could be more profound. Brief length serves tension between immediate conflict and generational legacy without feeling artificially constrained. Lingers more as concept than fully realized human drama.</comment>
