<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but underdeveloped: Marcus' insecurity lacks nuance in shaping decisions, and his transformation feels abrupt rather than earned through specific behavioral shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot mechanics function but lack polish: The mystery drives progression, but pacing issues and underdeveloped cause-effect relationships (e.g., Eliza's transcendence mechanics) create narrative gaps within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Ambient details generate atmosphere but lack memorable specificity: The "eerie blue glow" and "dusty console" create a cyberpunk mood, but fail to offer fresh or tactile sensory experiences beyond genre tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong thematic undercurrents with imperfect execution: The interplay between consciousness and fragility prompts reflection, though emotional impact is diluted by rushed character psychology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Predictable elements outweigh innovation: The consciousness-transfer trope is given a minimal subversion through the "duplicate" decoy, but relies heavily on familiar sci-fi structures without deep reinvention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Cohesive but constrained: Elements combine logically, though the brevity occasionally sacrifices depth; the ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks visceral emotional payoff.</comment>
