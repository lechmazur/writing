<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually clear but lacks emotional depth; motivations are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced actions or internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical arc but relies on coincidence (DVD's timing) and underdevelops the pivotal shift in councilors' decisions, weakening causal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions of twilight and the shop create a tactile, immersive atmosphere that heightens the central tension between decay and hope.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., "missing teeth") and the symbolic rebellion are effective, but the resolution feels slightly pat, undermining thematic complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s with a unique rebellion method, but the DVD's influence and council's abrupt change verge on predictable narrative shortcuts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesive and impactful despite brevity; some structural seams (e.g., leap from lights to council vote) prevent full mastery.</comment>
