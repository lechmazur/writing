<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Weaker in emotional depth despite clear motivation; reactions to concepts lack nuanced human complexity, making character feel more like a concept than a person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot exists but is thinly implied (protecting bees from weaponization) with no conflict resolution; pacing steady but static within tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrast between cosmic and organic, but connections between setting/objects and plot mechanics remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Visual poetry in bees as cosmic/quantum metaphors works; ending lacks emotional progression despite thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh imagery (cosmic bees, quantum flight patterns) but occasionally dips into quasi-lyrical abstraction over purposeful detail (e.g., repetitive "mixed blessings" phrasing).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Conceptually cohesive but execution prioritizes atmosphere over narrative momentum; intriguing fragments without full synthesis.</comment>
