<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation aligns with her actions, but her personality lacks nuanced internal conflict despite clear goals. Dialogue reveals determination but not layered character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal logic holds, but the compressed arc feels slightly rushed; the ending provides resolution but sacrifices tension-building in favor of thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative autumnal decay and fractured mirror imagery create immersive atmosphere, though sensory details about the labyrinth’s physicality remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphor (mirrors as distorted perception) and resonant dialogue elevate thematic depth; some show-don’t-tell tendencies (e.g., explicit "hope for tomorrow") undercut immersion slightly.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés (Mirror Walker portrayed as luminous rather than monstrous), but mentor’s aphorism and "breadcrumbs" line verge on trope; prose occasionally leans on ornate phrasing unnecessarily.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High cohesion despite numerous elements; some feel pragmatic (leaf raking as cover) but overall execution demonstrates creative integration with thematic resonance.</comment>
