<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Weak psychological depth; motivation (absolution) is clear but redemption feels rushed and unearned. The trembling hands as physical manifestation of guilt is heavy-handed. Shaky mercenary identity lacks distinct voice beyond generic "tortured soul" archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fragmented structure due to tight word limit creates awkward transitions (e.g. stranger instantly recognizing amber). Clear arc but pivotal moments lack tension. Finalizing journey through painting feels abrupt but provides minimal closure. Plot relies on contrived conveniences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie atmosphere in cathedral details (lanterns through ruins, "echoing hour") works well. Amber's connection to collapsing artistry needs stronger thematic throughline. Sensory details uneven - visual dominates while missing tactile/spatial logic (how does melted amber interact with canvas?).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Emotional impact emerges through symbolic transformation over explicit explanation. Metaphor of weaving vs. destruction gains potency in final image. However, "weight lifting" clich√© and didactic "making peace" conclusion undercut subtlety. Strong showing-through-imagery weakened by thematic overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Redemption arc avoids overt sentimentality through painterly symbolism. Cathedral-as-artist-sanctuary combines assigned elements inventively. Some purple prose ("heart remembered") and inconsistent metaphor density. Emotional arc feels human despite structural contrivances. Tension between destruction/creation shows creative thinking.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Coherence emerges from thematic resonance rather than plot mechanics. Assigned elements form cohesive artistic metaphor but mechanical integration varies. Word count forces superficial treatment of psychological shifts. Lingering impression from visual symbolism overshadows narrative shortcuts.</comment>
