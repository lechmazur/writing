<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's motivations are clear but underdeveloped; his "groggy" state and "flippant solemnity" surface without deep psychological grounding. Actions align with stated values but lack human complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Arc from graveyard to transformation is logically paced but feels rushed in execution. Ritual mechanics lack full integration with plot logic, and ending resolution appears abrupt under constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Setting relies on gothic clich√©s with minimal subversion. Atmospheric elements like "encroaching darkness" create visual texture but fail to produce haunting resonance or meaningful interaction with brewing thematics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story explores authenticity through surreal metaphor and symbolic objects. Impact diluted by predictable structure, though the beer-ritual fusion and mirror's role show conceptual cleverness without profound emotional undercurrents.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Blends genre tropes with niche brewing philosophy but remains derivative. Some forced details ("uniquely generic") contrast awkwardly with atmospheric needs; avoids full purple prose but occasionally leans on formulaic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Limited cohesion from element constraints. Concepts function narratively but lack organic integration. Ending aims for thematic resonance yet feels perfunctory, leaving structural compromises exposed.</comment>
