<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Eliza's sleep-deprivation and obsession are clear but psychological nuance is lacking—her transition from despair to triumph feels underexplored despite the pivotal moment. The "singularly plural" motif hints at depth but remains more thematic than character-driven.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tight pacing and a clear arc (failed past/urgent present/breakthrough) work within the constraint. The broadcast timing feels contrived—radio waves amplifying resonance requires unexplained pseudo-science—but the DNA-sound animation sequence is logically consistent. Causality clear but overly reliant on coincidence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The neon orchard's artificial glow and holographic skies create vivid cyberpunk imagery, but its connection to Eliza's work remains surface-level. Sensory details (thickening air, clay scraping) serve the atmosphere well, though the setting feels more decorative than integral to the experiment's mechanics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fusion of scientific precision and poetic metaphor ("DNA strands into sound") creates emotional resonance. The ending's duality—"singular and plural"—ties to subtext about legacy vs. isolation. Some telling ("walls of shame") undercuts subtlety, but the bell's metallic clarity as a symbol elevates the craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through unusual combinations (DNA melodies animating clay), yet some phrasing ("bloodshot from 72 hours without sleep") leans on familiar tropes. Technical jargon (e.g., frequency modulator) feels authentic, but the shame/redemption arc follows predictable contours. Metaphors are fresh but occasionally overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively—radio timing, DNA resonance, neon atmosphere all serve the theme of bridging organic/inorganic—but the brevity sacrifices secondary stakes. The ending lingers through its thematic density, though the final flourish about Eliza's future legacy feels slightly imposed rather than earned.</comment>
