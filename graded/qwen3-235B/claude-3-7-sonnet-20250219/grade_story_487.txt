<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character has surface contrast (brute with baton), but emotional depth feels cursory. Brother's apparition lacks reciprocal interaction to deepen motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows clear physical journey but emotional arc feels truncated. Pacing balances action with reflection but sacrifices complexity for brevity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Greenhouse excels through specific, haunting sensory details (metallic scent, digestive juices) and atmosphere that reinforces thematic and physical danger.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story offers emotional resonance through myth-making but relies on familiar tropes (lost sibling) without sufficiently recontextualizing them. Show/don't tell principle inconsistently applied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Blends mythic elements with grounded grief effectively in places, but relies on generic "man-eating plants" trope. Some phrases ("moonlight prismatic shadows") verge on overwrought. Emotional beats feel partially formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story attempts thematic cohesion but struggles to fully integrate all assigned elements. Emotional impact is genuine yet somewhat diminished by narrative economy constraints.</comment>
