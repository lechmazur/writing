<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character has some depth through paradox trait but lacks nuanced reactions beyond plot-driven actions; motivation is clear but underdeveloped thematically.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Solid cause-effect logic and time-constrained urgency work well, but the sudden "understanding" about the library feels underprepared within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visually cohesive fusion of ancient and modern elements with strong sensory integration; holographic druids and solar torches enhance cultural tension central to the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original concept execution shows ingenuity but contains isolated purple prose ("weight of history itself"); emotional subtext is mostly shown through action rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>High-concept framework holds together cohesively despite tight constraints; some elements feel like narrative scaffolding rather than organically evolved components.</comment>
