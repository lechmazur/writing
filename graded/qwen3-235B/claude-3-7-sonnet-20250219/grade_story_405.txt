<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lacks nuance in Marcus' transformation; motivations are clear but underdeveloped. Dialogue fails to fully reveal character depth beyond surface desperation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong despite tight word limits, but reliance on coincidence (petals revealing coordinates) strains plausibility. Resolution feels expedited.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered but inconsistently integrated. The mushroom farm’s phosphorescent fungi enhance mood, but setting’s symbolic potential remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</comment><grade>Metaphors (e.g., grief as guidance) resonate emotionally, but subtext is occasionally undermined by expository dialogue. Ending achieves reflective impact.</grade>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality in combining grief, fungal imagery, and urban exploration avoids formulaic tropes. Avoids purple prose but relies slightly on archetypal “lost child” narratives.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements is commendable, but some (mushroom farm, recipe testing) feel tangential. Leaves lingering thematic resonance despite narrative concision.</comment>
