<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (protecting the expendable) is clear but lacks nuanced emotional depth; reactions to the belt buckle are functional rather than revealing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc but relies on surface-level tension; cause-effect logic is sound, yet pacing skates the edge of simplicity within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cyberpunk and planetarium juxtaposition creates evocative contrasts; sensory details suggest atmosphere but lack immersive specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Symbols (belt buckle, constellations) convey theme well, but emotional resonance is undercut by explicit exposition; ending feels purposeful but predictable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Subverts cyberpunk/fate tropes with quantum-flavored cosmic intervention; stylish yet occasionally veers into over-explaining rather than showing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere well into a tight, memorable narrative; brevity feels intentional, though thematic depth is occasionally sacrificed for efficiency.</comment>
