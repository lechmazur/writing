<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations around quantifying emotions are clear but underserved by shallow personality traits; reactions to stamps/flash mob lack psychological depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on surreal concept but suffers from abrupt flash mob introduction; pacing is efficient though the resolution feels contrived despite tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setting details (cold metal, humming vibrations) are sparse but atmospheric; particle accelerator and stamp iconography lack thematic integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (quantum entanglement as emotional connection) are conceptually bold but emotionally thin; ending leans on poetic clich√©s rather than earned resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tropes but still features strained logic (flash mobs in secure facilities, nonexistent countries) and undercooked emotional beats that feel algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story coalesces around a provocative theme but strains credibility; elements combine inventively yet unevenly, diluting impact.</comment>
