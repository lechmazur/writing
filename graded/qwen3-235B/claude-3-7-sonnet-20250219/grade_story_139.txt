<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Brother Tenzin’s motivation is clear (avenging his master) and aligned with his “stubborn” trait, but his emotional depth feels surface-level; his internal conflict between vengeance and redemption is hinted at but lacks nuanced exploration despite the first-person perspective.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints, with a clear arc from arrival to confrontation. The tooth-mark analysis drives the action logically, but the pacing feels slightly rushed during the transition from the gondola to the temple, undermining tension buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (e.g., mist, golden spires, gondola sounds) immerse readers in a vivid Himalayan monastery. Atmosphere supports the somber, mystical tone, though the setting’s spiritual significance could be more deeply woven into the narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (flute as truth-teller, tooth marks as proof) elevates the theme of justice over vengeance. Ending resonates thematically, but the emotional payoff lacks visceral impact due to compressed character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés; the tooth-mark clue and abbot twist are inventive. Sensory details are specific, but some phrases (“weight of decades,” “fertile soil of the past”) border on overwrought metaphor. Emotional nuance is shown but occasionally undercut by didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere around a central theme but lack deeper integration. The concise format works for tension but sacrifices secondary worldbuilding. Lingering resonance hinges on the moral dilemma, though the story avoids predictable revenge tropes.</comment>
