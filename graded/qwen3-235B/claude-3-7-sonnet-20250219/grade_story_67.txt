<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Hamish’s jovial demeanor and earring habit establish personality, but motivations lack psychological depth. Thornberry’s desperation is clear but thinly justified. Interactions reveal character quirks more than layered humanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear plot builds tension around time constraints, but the 17-minute calibration lacks narrative stakes beyond meeting Thornberry’s goals. Resolution feels abrupt rather than earned, though the ending’s thematic pivot redeems some structural simplicity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gear-strewn attic with shifting light/shadow and clanking metronome immerses readers physcially. Timeframe’s dusk-to-darkness transition elegantly mirrors the ‘taming darkness’ theme. Sensory details occasionally veer toward cataloging rather than visceral engagement.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors about darkness/light resonate as Hamish’s final realization contrasts with Thornberry’s rigidity. Subtext about the limitations of control is elegantly sketched, though emotional payoff hinges on brief gestures rather than sustained tension. Writing remains crisp but occasionally formal in reflective passages.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh lens on ‘taming darkness’ avoids cosmic fantasy clichés. Dialogue remains lean yet character-specific. Avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on abstract adjectives (‘cathedral to mechanical dreams’) where sharper imagery could deepen authenticity. Subtext feels earned, not imposed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>Thematic cohesion between craftsmanship, invention, and human limitation feels organic. Concise form amplifies time pressure but underexplores secondary tensions. Lingering resonance stems from the earring motif and inversion of ‘defeating darkness’ tropes. Slight unevenness in pacing/temporal logic prevents flawless execution.</grade>
