<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While Bartholomew’s rigidity and emotional repression are clearly established through his profession and reactions, the estranged sister subplot feels underdeveloped, weakening the depth of his transformation. The catalyst (the bulb) drives change effectively, but the emotional resonance lacks gradual buildup.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The envelope discovery accelerates the plot efficiently, but the sudden bulb-induced epiphany strains credibility. Pacing falters in the emotional climax—key realizations are told more than shown. The circular structure (cemetery imagery bookends the story) works, but the transformation feels abbreviated.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse/cemetery juxtaposition creates haunting visual contrast. Sensory details (lavender-ash adhesive scent, bulb’s question-mark filament) deepen atmosphere. However, Tesla’s bulb feels anachronistically jarring, diluting the eerie tone. Strong but inconsistent integration of elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (e.g., “arms of steel”) and the bulb’s responsive glow elevate the emotional arc. The ending’s “buried optimism” is poignant, but explicit declarations like “weight of his isolation” undercut subtler imagery. Dialogue absence limits character voice exploration.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The witch’s role feels like a plot device rather than integral worldbuilding. Some descriptions (“gravestones tilting like crooked teeth”) are fresh, but the Tesla bulb leans on recognizable brand-name mystique rather than organic symbolism. Emotional beats occasionally lapse into stated sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the theme of self-reconciliation, but the anachronistic Tesla bulb and underdeveloped sister subplot reveal tension between worldbuilding ambition and narrative brevity. The story suggests deeper layers but feels constrained by its own density.</comment>
