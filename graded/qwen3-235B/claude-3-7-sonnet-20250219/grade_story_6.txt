<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Finley's skepticism is consistent but underdeveloped; his shift from rational debunker to willing participant lacks emotional groundwork. Dialogue lacks distinct voice to fully anchor his identity as a minstrel.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory but feels compressed; pivotal action (slinging the scale) hinges on sudden character change rather than gradual progression. Cause and effect are logical but lack narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Factory setting is atmospheric but underutilized—sensory details are sparse. Timeframe (midday emptiness) creates eerie mood but feels disconnected from the dragon-summoning resolution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Uses metaphor (disappearing ink as doubt) effectively but relies on surface-level paradox (skeptic seeking supernatural). Ending is poignant yet derivative; theme of sacrifice lacks emotional punch.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (e.g., dragon-scale as plot device) but strains logic with slingshot's implausibility. Language is crisp and evocative; no purple prose. Subverts trickster trope via Finley’s choice but leans on genre conventions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but not elevated beyond their literal functions. The 500-word limit sacrifices depth in character motivation and thematic exploration. Lingering impression is clever but not transformative.</comment>
