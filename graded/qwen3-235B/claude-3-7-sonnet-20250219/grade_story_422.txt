<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's muteness and ventriloquism are well-integrated motivators, with puppets serving as both communication tools and emotional surrogates. However, emotional depth could be richer; secondary character reactions sometimes overshadow Milo's internal complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot adheres tightly to a short-story framework: inciting incident (calls), rising tension (calculations), climax (decision), and resolution (spoken choice). Pacing feels slightly rushed during the waitress’s realization but maintains coherence through thematic repetition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Parallel universe’s inverted geography ("ocean hung above") creates intrigue, but atmosphere relies heavily on brief descriptors rather than sustained sensory immersion. Tonal contrast between surreal setting and mundane diner works but lacks layered worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story evinces emotional resonance through symbolic objects (puppets as family, coffee sleeve as scientific/artistic record). Ending’s thematic payoff—home as a choice—is poignant, enhanced by subtext in ventriloquism as proxy for marginalized voices.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Creative premise avoids genre clichés, though dimensional rift concept leans slightly familiar. Ventriloquism-as-communication method feels organic. Dialogue occasionally veers toward exposition (e.g., Lady Latte’s "family you’ve created") but mostly serves character voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements work symbiotically: muteness necessitates puppets; coffee sleeve visualizes Milo’s dual identity; parallel universe contextualizes family redefinition. Tight frame feels intentional, though some connections (e.g., euphoric agitation as tone) could be more dynamically explored.</comment>
