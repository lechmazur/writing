<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but motivation lacks psychological nuance; transformation feels underdeveloped despite thematic coherence with object and concept.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot arc is complete but pacing uneven – revelation comes suddenly without sufficient progression, while cause-effect of curse reversal relies on abstract logic rather than concrete narrative beats.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory immersion through synesthetic details (fruit as "unwritten calendar," vines "retreating"); atmosphere enhances mystical-realist tone while meaningfully connecting setting/objects to thematic duality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism (curse/blessing symmetry, cameo mirroring) creates emotional resonance; ending feels both earned and thematically inevitable, though some metaphorical abstractions overshadow character authenticity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés through original curse logic and lyrical precision; occasional overreliance on "whispers from shadows" type phrases and slightly mechanical philosophical articulation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silkily cohesive narrative where every element serves theme; brevity enhances mythic quality rather than limiting it, leaving lingering conceptual impact about perception's role in shaping reality.</comment>
