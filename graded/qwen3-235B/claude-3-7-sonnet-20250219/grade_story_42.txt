<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt and motivation are stated but undershown; inner conflict lacks depth despite alignment with actions. Personality remains abstract beyond archetypal "tortured artist" sketches.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot arc from discovery to resolution exists but feels compressed; cause/effect between the wind skirmish and map revelation strains believability in the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere succeeds in blending ancient decay with mechanical energy through wind/turbine details; sensory immersion occasionally overrides narrative purpose in later paragraphs.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (turbines echoing monks, forgery becoming truth) resonate thematically; subtext about redemption through preservation elevates beyond surface plot despite predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but treads familiar "lone seeker finds enlightenment" territory; stylized prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction but maintains distinctive voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere formally but not always emotionally; brevity serves atmosphere better than character depth, leaving thematic resolution somewhat schematic.</comment>
