<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’ lukewarm magic aligns with his cautious hopefulness, but his "loyally peculiar" label lacks deeper exploration beyond surface quirks. Vega’s revealed sketches add dimension but feel under-integrated with her character’s stated authority.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compact structure effectively uses 17-minute urgency to bind setup to resolution. Pacing feels deliberate, though the emotional pivot from vulnerability to collaboration lacks tension escalation.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Lunar base’s sterile pragmatism contrasts poetically with ephemeral projections. Sensory details (swirling dust-fog, dimming lights) immerse reader, though the "charred serenity" tone could permeate more deeply.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Metaphors (torn doormat as memory, clashing silhouettes as rebirth) resonate. The ending’s collaborative hope avoids sentimentality, earning emotional weight through quiet imagery over exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh blend of post-apocalyptic grit and magical realism. Some phrases ("whispers of a future") flirt with cliché, but the ritual’s fusion of magic/tech avoids formulaic writing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Assigned elements interweave purposefully, each enhancing thematic cohesion. The lunar setting, fragile projections, and shared grief create layered meaning without over-explanation.</comment>
