<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Weak differentiation between character-specific motivation and generic narrative drive; internal consistency exists but lacks psychological nuance in key moments like the climactic revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Contrived convergence of plot elements in final scene; cause-effect chain relies on mystical deus ex machina rather than organic narrative progression; word limit exposes structural seams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some striking synthetic sensory details but atmospheric cohesion undermined by inconsistent emotional temperature shifts; setting's industrial-nature fusion remains underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Occasional lyrical passages contrast with didactic exposition; thematic elements present but unevenly developed; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on symbolic gesture over nuanced human reaction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing traps but occasionally sacrifices verisimilitude for poetic abstraction; some descriptions edge toward preciousness while maintaining overall linguistic discipline.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Core concept sustains interest despite uneven execution; strongest elements (post-dream premise, ecological spirituality) merit contemplation but narrative polish inconsistent with top-tier publication standards.</comment>
