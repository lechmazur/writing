<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's pragmatic approach is consistent with her actions and motivation, but depth of internal conflict or emotional nuance is lacking. Her role as a soothsayer is underexplored beyond functional plot relevance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure exists within the constraint, but pacing stumbles during the seven-night montage. Cause/effect is logical, though the resolution feels slightly abrupt despite the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions establish Thornwick's physical uniqueness and the hammer's symbolic weight. Atmosphere aligns with "dreadful hope," but sensory immersion could deepen beyond visual elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic coherence (preservation vs. transformation) and skillful use of metaphor (seeds as symbiosis). Ending resonates thematically, but emotional impact feels slightly muted by restrained prose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unique juxtaposition (pragmatic mysticism). Some descriptions verge on ornate, but overall style maintains purposeful clarity. Human-like subtext present but not groundbreaking.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a unified narrative with deliberate brevity. Conceptual integration is strong, though the thematic richness occasionally feels compressed rather than expanded by the form.</comment>
