<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characters' solitude is well-established, but emotional depth remains superficial. Their motivations (silent connection through cosmic patterns) are consistent yet underexplored, leaning on poetic implication rather than layered psychological realism. Dialogue feels functional but not revelatory of inner complexities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Circular structure (meteor showers bookending the narrative) provides cohesion, but the episodic progression lacks narrative urgency. Key developments (equinox scene) are emotionally resonant but undercut by abrupt temporal leaps without sufficient connective weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is generally immersive, with sensory details about ink, herbs, and meteor light creating evocative textures. However, the castle's reimagined historical context remains underutilized; the setting could have deeper thematic resonance as a bridge between tradition and modernity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dual symbolism of flora/art as communication achieves poetic subtext. The ending's thematic repetition works, but emotional impact is diluted by over-reliance on abstract descriptors ("harmony," "distant intimacy") rather than concrete imagery. The central metaphor occasionally feels labored rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into art-mysticism conventions without adding distinctive authorial voice. Some phrases ("celestial correspondence") verge on preciousness; emotional tone shifts could better reflect human complexity beneath their austere exteriors.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>All assigned elements cohesively integrated, but many feel more like atmospheric scaffolding than narrative engines. The brevity works thematically yet sacrifices deeper character exploration. Suggests potential for expansion rather than complete conceptual mastery.</comment>
