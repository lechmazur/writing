<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character insights are present but generic; motivations are clear but lack psychological depth, relying on familiar tropes of artistic regret without exploring nuanced inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but uneven; pivotal transitions (library discovery) feel abrupt, undermining pacing despite effective thematic bookending.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly rendered with sensory details (frost, fungi), but the fantastical library strains believability, creating tonal dissonance with the grounded opening.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong symbolic layering (frost/leaves/fireworks) elevates craft; emotional resonance is undercut by predictable character beats and resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Blends trope-heavy elements (hidden library, mentor's manuscript) with semi-original concepts (harmonic pyrotechnics); avoids overt clich√©s but leans on formulaic redemption arcs.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Successfully integrates assigned elements into a cohesive arc, though some (library) feel contrived; thematic ambition compensates for occasional mechanical storytelling.</comment>
