<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character motivations (subconscious weaving, exile healing) align with traits, but skittishness lacks depth beyond initial nervousness. Voice feels literary but slightly artificial in first-person sections.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from Elias's arrival to tapestry completion, with clear cause-effect in thread-reconnecting method. Pacing slightly drags in middle but maintains arc within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through lunar colony sensory details (dust, loom textures) and barbershop simile. Rustic refinement contrasts with sterility effectively, though some descriptions border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance via exile metaphor and healing theme. Imagery (glowing ballet shoes, interlaced continents) and symbolism are potent, with subtext about cultural memory enriching narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pseudo-scientific "psychoactive weaving" risks trope status but is subverted through tactile execution. Avoids purple prose generally; barbershop simile feels oddly conventional for a lunar setting.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</question><grade>Anchors speculative elements (subconscious weaving) in human themes (belonging), though some assigned components (dramatically understated attribute) fit more organically than others. Lingering impact stems from craft-as-healing motif.</grade>
