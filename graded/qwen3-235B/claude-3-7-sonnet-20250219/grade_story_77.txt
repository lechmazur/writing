<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character traits are established but lack depth in their impact on actions; motivation is somewhat internalized but occasionally feels stated rather than revealed through nuanced choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure and resolution within constraints, but pacing feels slightly hurried in places; the marionette's discovery and activation are logical but lack tension or setbacks.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere pairs with emotional tone, but setting details (asteroid hideout, starfish) are inconsistently tied to deeper worldbuilding; sensory details are present but not sharply distinctive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional resonance and thematic complexity; symbols (marionette, starfish) are effective but underdeveloped; ending resolves neatly but avoids grappling with ambiguity or moral complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Story avoids overt clich√©s but relies on familiar sci-fi/fantasy tropes (exiled empaths, sacred artifacts) without subversion; prose is smooth but occasionally leans on generic phrases ("knowing eyes," "ancient energy").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly integrated; concise format works narratively but restricts deeper exploration of themes; premise is engaging but lacks urgency or unexpected insights.</comment>
