<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character motivation (curiosity/reignite purpose) drives action but lacks emotional texture; “social media exorcist” premise intriguingly vague, leaving personality shaped more by genre tropes than lived-in details; reactions to the receipt and headset feel narratively functional but underexplored psychologically.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum hinges on receipt-as-macguffin and infiltration method, which propel Mira toward the climax but rely on implausible leaps (e.g., decoding purchase items as “code”); pacing tight but resolution feels abrupt, compressing transformation into a single scene without earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives on juxtaposing obsolete tech with modern occultism—candlelight flickering over “fragmented code” creates rich sensory dissonance; “quietly loud strangers” and decrepit mess hall ground the eerie tone, though timeframe element (final chord) feels tacked on rather than integral to setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Conceptual twist (hauntings as human-made) carries thematic heft, critiquing digital escapism; underused metaphors (receipt as altar offering) hint at deeper subtext but rely on exposition; ending’s “threshold” moment is evocative but leans on familiar “initiate” clichés rather than original revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Social media exorcism premise avoids genre staleness, but execution borders on aestheticized cliché (“algorithmic ghosts” never fully explained); prose is crisp but occasionally hollow (e.g., “raw edge” feels glib); infiltrating clubs and receipt-code are clever plot devices but strain credulity as lived-in narrative choices.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements mostly serve the plot, but some—like the music hall’s final chord—feel forced; brevity works for mystery but sacrifices character depth; central conflict (exorcist confronting creation) is resonant but underdeveloped; ending lingers thematically but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>
