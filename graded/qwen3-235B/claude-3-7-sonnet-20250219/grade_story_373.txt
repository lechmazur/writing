<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but could use more interiority; the professional dedication layer feels thin. The cybernetic aspect shapes actions but voice lacks depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pacing balances exposition and action but relies on summary over progression; the surgical scene drives coherence, though the reflective ending feels abrupt within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kaleidoscopic coral and bioluminescent algae create vivid, symbolic atmosphere; “raucous silence” conceptually strong but underexplored. Sensory details anchor worldbuilding but inconsistently deepen motive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of technology/nature coexistence and defiance of norms resonate; emotional impact is undermined by overt exposition (“devour a sacred taboo” stated flatly). Strong imagery but subtext uneven.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (cybernetic vet, renegade scientist) through specific details (blacksmith’s bucket, nanite gel); some generic phrases (“challenging perceptions”) and didactic dialogue weaken nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements feel curated rather than organic—motels, coral, train whistle tie to plot but often as adornments; the theme is compelling, but narrative cohesion strains under the weight of them.</comment>
