<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes rather than fully realized individuals; motivations like "defiant compassion" feel imposed rather than earned through nuanced behavior or internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but sacrifices emotional payoff for mystical spectacle; the transition from ritual to transcendence feels abrupt despite effective buildup of symbolic actions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Visually rich but thematically disconnected; the lab's scars and spices lack narrative purpose beyond gothic atmosphere, failing to deepen the story's exploration of tradition or misfit identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative imagery (crystalline skulls, luminescent silver) dazzles but lacks thematic anchor; emotional resonance is diluted by reliance on abstract concepts over human-scale consequences.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Relies on overfamiliar tropes (tortured genius, forbidden lab) with insufficient subversion; metaphors like "compass needle to true north" feel formulaic despite moments of originality in descriptive language.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Cohesion exists superficially through shared motifs, but elements function more as decorative symbols than interconnected narrative forces; the theme of tradition-breaking remains under-explained and inconsistent with the experiment's mechanics.</comment>
