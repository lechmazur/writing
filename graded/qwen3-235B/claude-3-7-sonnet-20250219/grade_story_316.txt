<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Inconsistent interiority undermines Eleni's timidity, reducing it to passive description rather than active characterization. Her motivation (keeping a promise) drives the plot but lacks emotional progression beyond duty to Thalia.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Linear structure efficiently delivers resolution, but the arcade quest feels perfunctory. Pacing stumbles during key transitions (e.g., retrieving ribbon information to completing the tapestry lacks narrative tension).</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Post-industrial temple fusion creates evocative visuals but underutilizes sensory potential. The stained glass transformation is striking but isolated, failing to fully permeate the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (tapestry as communal narrative) succeed through concrete imagery, but the emotional payoff relies too heavily on declarative statements ("healing chorus") rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("scattered harmony" remains conceptually vague). Some details (e.g., hospital bed dialogue) prioritize function over psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements cohere thematically but strain under tight word constraints. The brevity works thematically but leaves character and setting development feeling truncated rather than deliberately distilled.</comment>
