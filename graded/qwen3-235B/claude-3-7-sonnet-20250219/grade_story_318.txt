<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s, balancing originality (lullabies as memory encoding) with some overly familiar emotional beats (parental sacrifice).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements synergize effectively, with the library's symbolic shift and the lullabies' revelation leaving a lingering, hopeful unease.</comment>
