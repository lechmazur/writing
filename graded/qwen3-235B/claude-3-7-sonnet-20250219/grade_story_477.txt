<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character’s grace and swordsmanship are visually established but disconnected from his intellectual pursuits; motivation to escape conformity is clear but lacks depth in emotional or psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot arc connects discovery to consequence but relies on abrupt conceptual leaps (e.g., salvaged TVs decoding cosmic signals); pacing feels rushed in pivotal moments yet drags in descriptive asides.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush, sensory-rich underwater setting and haunting juxtaposition of bird songs enhance the story’s themes of isolation and transcendence; atmosphere is a visceral, active force.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Striking imagery and thematic resonance (freedom vs. conformity, evolution through individuality) elevate the narrative; ending lacks visceral emotional payoff despite strong subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Combines familiar tropes (dystopian conformity, cosmic signals) with inventive logic (ocean as lens), but phrases like “lucid frenzy” feel overly deliberate; avoids outright clichés but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements like the telescope and cosmic signals are tightly woven, but the swordsman’s grace feels extraneous; brevity serves poetic impact but dilutes character depth.</comment>
