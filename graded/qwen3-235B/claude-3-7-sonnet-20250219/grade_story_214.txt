<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Harlan's grief-driven motivation is clear and consistent, but his actions (tachyon bursts, microfilm decoding) occasionally strain realism. The sea glass effectively reveals his emotional state, though first-person narration lacks distinct idiosyncrasies beyond introspective melancholy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tight word limit is handled skillfully, with beginning-middle-end structure (solitude-discovery-resolution). The core action (recommencing decoding) drives the plot logically, though the shady archives' origin and tachyon mechanics remain under-explained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive with sensory details (prismatic starlight, "silent hum"), but the "gritty" aspect is underdeveloped. The observatory's isolation enhances the theme, but space debris as a "museum" remains superficial.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (black hole as grief, sea glass as memory) are evocative, and the ending balances melancholy/hope. Minor issues include occasional melodrama ("radiance from a black hole of doubt") and underexplored subtext about consciousness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original premise avoids typical AI tropes, but the microfilm clich√© and DNA encoding stretch credibility. Prose avoids excessive ornamentation, though the sea glass's "pulsing" borders on magical convenience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements serve the story cohesively despite some contrivances (smuggled microfilm). The brevity feels intentional, leaving lingering themes of loss-as-freedom without over-explanation.</comment>
