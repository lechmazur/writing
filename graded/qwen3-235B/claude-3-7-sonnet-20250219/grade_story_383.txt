<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>General Thorne's weariness is convincingly physicalized, but his transition from hollow veteran to tentative renewal feels compressed; Mira's "mischievous wisdom" lacks nuanced contradiction between her cosmic perspective and mundane diner existence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on abstract epiphany rather than escalating action; the arc from "commanding fleets" to "capturing arcs" relies on poetic juxtaposition over narrative momentum; diner setting creates circular stasis rather than clear three-act movement within tight word count.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Quantum Wars backstory effectively implied through details like seaweed crisps and terraformer's stained hands; atmosphere merges melancholy (windless flag uniform) and fragile hope (cream spiral) but could deepen interstellar-specific sensory elements beyond generic diner tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor of "arcs" as both photographic motion and existential renewal displays layered meaning; the camera's symbolic weight (lighter/weightier than medals/regrets) brilliantly crystallizes thematic tension; dialogue avoids clichéd therapist-roboty platitudes through poetic restraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wind chimes" simile risks preciousness; story resists overtly stating "soldier's PTSD" in favor of oblique manifestations (uniform bagginess, medal weight), but some phrases like "throne of reason" flirt with declamatory didacticism; overall style walks tightrope between lyrical and purple.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blends assigned elements into coherent whole but reveals seams under scrutiny – dark matter diner's quantum context insufficiently differentiated from generic space truck stop; "rational absurdity" concept remains surface-level quip rather than philosophical engine; emotional impact genuine but not transformative.</comment>
