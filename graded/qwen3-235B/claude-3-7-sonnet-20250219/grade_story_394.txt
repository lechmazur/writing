<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but lack depth; the archer's internal struggles aren't fully explored, making her more symbolic than human. "Cautious impulsiveness" is stated but not woven into decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but relies on rushed exposition. The decoding of leaf patterns and fork mechanism lacks procedural logic. Pacing feels compressed, especially for high-stakes climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visually rich with evocative details (rust, silver, light) but emotional resonance with "legacy of compassion" feels underdeveloped. Sensory elements outpace thematic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong symbolic devices (bent fork key, mercy constellation) and layered theme of collective memory elevate the narrative. Some dialogue ("Your knowledge dies here") leans toward didacticism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Idea of an amusement park colosseum avoids clichés, but "ancient evil" trope undermines originality. Metaphors like "constellation of mercy" feel fresh. Emotional stakes rely partially on explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.5</comment>Most elements are logically integrated, though the mentor’s leaf-pattern clue feels mechanical. The ending’s thematic resonance is clear but doesn't fully transcend fantasy genre conventions.</comment>
