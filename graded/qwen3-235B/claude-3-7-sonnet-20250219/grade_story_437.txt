<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct but psychological complexity remains shallow; motivations for deception touch on universal insecurity but lack deeper exploration of moral ambiguity or personal cost.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cycles of growth/decay drive subtle arc; tight framing of key moment crystallizes theme effectively. Minor pacing unevenness in exposition-heavy opening.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Toxic sky and hydroponic decay contrast vividly with preserved garden photographs; rain creates tactile tension between artificial sanctuary and external rot. Sensory details never feel gratuitous.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic subtext about constructed truth resonates; ending's dissolution of identity shows elegance. Relies too heavily on explicitly stated emotions like "guilt" rather than embodied reactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic cult framework contains fresh existential questions but defaults to familiar broken-divinity tropes. Avoids purple prose yet occasionally reduces complex moral dilemmas to binary hypocrisy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrated thematically rather than checklisted; ending's philosophical ambiguity suggests deliberate brevity, though some concept connections remain surface-level.</comment>
