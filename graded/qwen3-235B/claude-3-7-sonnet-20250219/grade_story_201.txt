<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Impulsive nature doesn't fully align with her methodical performance plan; emotional inheritance is stated rather than deeply felt, but the character's voice carries thematic weight in key moments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to triumph, but rushed pacing in establishing the connection between protagonist and deceased grandmother weakens the emotional payoff despite effective climax.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere combines striking sensory details (waterfall mist, twilight colors) and symbolic crumbling architecture perfectly with thematic resonance; ruins-as-legacy metaphor is powerfully maintained.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors ("stone upon stone of sound") elevate storytelling; tension between historical injustice and artistic redemption is poignant; ending achieves emotional weight without sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids major clich√©s but contains some overwritten descriptions ("celestial movements", "pain into beauty") that border on formulaic; emotional nuance exists but isn't consistently layered beneath subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into emotionally resonant narrative; short length feels purposeful; themes of reclaimed legacy linger, though deeper psychological exploration could elevate impact.</comment>
