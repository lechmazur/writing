<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Marlowe's 'impassive' demeanor is consistent but thinly sketched; his motivation for seeking 'pure grace' remains abstract rather than emotionally resonant. His actions (twisting tie, observing bees) illustrate ritual but lack psychological depth. The 'cautious bravery' tone is vaguely signaled but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot unfolds with atmospheric momentum but lacks narrative stakes. The recurring visits structure works within the constraint, but cause/effect between Marlowe's actions and the orchard's phenomena strain believability. Pacing balances contemplation and climax but falters on resolving the implied tension between duty and transcendence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eerie cathedral-orchar duality is vividly rendered through tactile contrasts (stone/fruit, light/shadow). Sensory details (vibrating twist tie, bees' hum) immerse effectively. The timeframe of 'oil changes' awkwardly juxtaposes banality with mysticism but fails to deepen either. Atmosphere triumphs over logical setting integration.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Striking imagery (bee crown, floating apple) lingers, but thematic heft on 'man vs. forgotten harmony' feels surface-level. Emotions are shown through environment more than character, leaving subtext underexplored. The ending's 'ember' metaphor resonates, while the mechanical patrolman motif risks clich√©.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original premise avoids genre tropes but veers into overwritten mysticism ('uncharted echoes,' bees as prophets). Some phrases ('secret wisdom') feel trope-adjacent; the cathedral's impossibility lacks anchoring details. The twist tie's vibration is a clever, tactile exception. Emotional restraint prevents full 'purple prose' collapse but distances readers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere visually but conceptually waver between parable and surrealism. The brevity suits a vignette but undermines character depth and thematic closure. Leverages contrasts (routine/wonder, sterile metal/organic life) inventively, leaving a haunting but fragmented impression.</comment>
