<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's core traits (desert past, archivist mission) shape actions, but emotional depth and growth remain superficial. Motivation is clear but underexplored; reactions to the ruler lack nuanced internal conflict or psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pacing is generally tight, with clear beginning (ruler poised, apple impending) and end (data secured). Plot momentum relies on poetic imagery over active stakes; transitions between observation and resolution feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative, multisensory atmosphere (ozone, starlight, creaking decks) creates immersion. Desert and cosmic elements clash subtly but intentionally; the "authentically artificial" framing adds thematic texture without overwhelming the story's logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., love as stellar resonance) are inventive, but emotional impact is diluted by an overreliance on abstract language. The theme of preservation vs. decay resonates, though the ending prioritizes poeticism over catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ("loaded curiosity," "desert's sighs") border on ornate abstraction, weakening precision. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally disconnected from character experience. Unique integration of cosmic/desert motifs avoids tropes but struggles with tonal consistency.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements (ruler, orchard, space setting) are interwoven but demand suspension of disbelief due to abstract logic. The story's brevity amplifies its poetic strengths but leaves thematic and emotional depths untapped. Lingering questions exist, but not necessarily productively.</comment>
