<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is vividly drawn with credible motivations, but grief-to-vengeance trajectory occasionally feels schematic. The vigilant orchardist identity shapes her pattern recognition but connections between agrarian past and technical competence strain plausibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Compacted plot succeeds in linking personal and institutional betrayal through the serpent seal motif, but peacock cipher device feels contrived. Demonstration scene elegantly merges teaching and subtle sabotage prevention, though narrative momentum relies heavily on coincidental discoveries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sterile test facility juxtaposed with memory-soaked orchard imagery creates potent tension. Sensory details (seal's tactile weight, air currents) anchor surreal elements. Peacock's presence lacks ecological logic but functions beautifully as visual and thematic centerpiece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Story wields paradoxical symbols with precision—the serpent seal as ancestral legacy/corporate complicity. The final confrontation employs technical jargon for dramatic effect, transforming bureaucratic stamp into weapon of justice. Sardonic tone subverts revenge narrative clichés with gallows humor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some metaphorical flourishes (grief-as-weapon framing) risk overstatement. The peacock's impossibly perfect patterns border on artificial, but most connections feel purposeful rather than algorithmic. Emotional stakes are earned through specific memories rather than melodramatic declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaves disparate elements into thematically coherent whole. The peacock/conspiracy connection pushes credulity but creates memorable narrative engine. Ending provides thematic resolution while maintaining tonal consistency, though facility's corporate malevolence remains underexplored.</comment>
