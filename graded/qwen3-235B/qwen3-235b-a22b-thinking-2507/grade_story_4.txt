<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Character's DJ identity and playful attribute remain superficial, never fully integrated into his mapping actions or decision-making. Motivation to map sacred spaces is clear but lacks emotional grounding or personal stakes beyond ritualistic duty.</comment>
