<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's sincerity and conjurer identity shape her introspective struggle, but secondary traits remain underdeveloped; her motivation to combat cynicism drives the plot, though the link between her conjuring and the shared dream lacks full integration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within constraints; the discovery-rationalization-dream arc moves cohesively, though transitions between waking and dream states slightly strain causality. Pacing balances introspection and revelation effectively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich sensory atmosphere merges salt-stung tears, ash-scented ruins, and creaking loom rhythms to mirror emotional states; the sanctuary's dysfunctionally functional nature and "between waves" framing create haunting contextual resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (woven light/rebellion, embers-as-connection) deepen the subtext; ending avoids simplistic triumphalism. The quiet defiance of continued creation against darkness lingers powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of textile metaphors and dream logic avoids clich√©s; some over-polished poeticism threatens to calcify. Emotional nuance emerges through tactile details rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements serve thematic unity rather than feeling imposed; the tight focus on existential struggle within limited space works intentionally. Lingering questions about the sanctuary's broader world slightly undercut cohesion.</comment>
