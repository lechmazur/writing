<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Underdeveloped link between past as dream thief and present actions; motivation is clear but lacks nuanced exploration of how his crime shaped his psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot coherence exists but pacing feels compressed; pivotal moments lack depth due to word constraints, leaving arc resolution rushed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Evocative imagery diluted by vague references to "last human born"; setting details like the treehouse are atmospheric but unevenly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like the photo album’s fragmentation elevate the narrative; ending’s resonance is undercut by unresolved tension between memory and reality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but stumbles with abstract descriptors (e.g., "quiet mania") that skim thematic depth; emotional beats occasionally veer toward poetic overprecision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Element cohesion is uneven; the dream thief premise and thunder motif work well, but the mathematical challenge and timeframe feel appended rather than foundational.</comment>
