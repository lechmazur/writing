<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, with grief driving concrete actions. Internal conflict feels authentic but lacks nuanced emotional depth that would elevate it beyond competently rendered trauma tropes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot achieves remarkable cohesion within tight word limits, with perfectly cyclical structure from trembling ascent to steady descent. Pacing balances introspection and momentum with precise rhythm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ruined cathedral setting merges architectural grandeur with urban decay through visceral sensory details. Atmosphere of mournful rebirth enhances both character motivations and thematic concerns about preservation vs release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors about fossilization and preservation resonate thematically but occasionally border on over-explanation. Ending achieves emotional impact through physical action (placing amber down) rather than explicit sentiment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through unexpected combinations (neon art in sacred ruins) yet occasionally falters with phrasing like "mercenary's burden." Symbolism feels purposeful rather than algorithmically generated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Every assigned element contributes to either character psychology or thematic resonance. The cathedral functions as dual physical/spiritual space while compact form maintains narrative focus throughout the tight emotional arc.</comment>
