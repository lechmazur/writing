<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's traits (fierce, methodically playful) inconsistently manifested; motivation to "hush illusions" feels intellectual rather than emotionally grounded; reactions to objects lack psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a ritualistic arc but lacks narrative tension; letter-transcription drives action cohesively, yet the compressed word count creates abrupt transitions and underdeveloped consequences of the "indoctrination." </comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and immersive (rusted girders, silt-covered deck) with sound-as-setting (radio static); the haunting atmosphere amplifies thematic resonance, though historical-political context remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (costume as delusion, static as imperfect truth) are potent; ending achieves thematic closure but lacks emotional weight; "showing" dominates but occasionally sacrifices character nuance for abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally leans on cold-war-era "conspiracy" shorthand; language is purposeful yet occasionally verges on self-conscious poeticism; subtext feels deliberate rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements assembled with thematic intention but unevenly weighted; the concise form feels enforced rather than essential; concept-layering impresses but character and plot suffer compression.</comment>
