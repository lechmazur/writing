<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Mute trait under-utilized beyond silence; motivation to find meaning is clear but lacks depth in showing how muteness shapes her perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression through portal creation works but lacks concrete emotional payoff; transitions are coherent but resolution feels abstract without character transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details about decay and snow enhance atmosphere; setting integration slightly inconsistent (e.g., how opera house connects to interdimensional concept).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with original metaphors (e.g., "kaleidoscope of shifting realms"); prose remains purposeful but slightly overburdened with poetic phrasing at times.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but could deepen thematic integration; brevity feels deliberate but sacrifices emotional immediacy with a slightly predictable "quest for truth" arc.</comment>
