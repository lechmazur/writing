<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Jack’s gamble-honed pattern recognition informs his problem-solving, but motivations hinge on underdeveloped trauma; Maya’s burns and their bond are implied but lack emotional depth. Action aligns with traits, but inner conflicts remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The workshop’s discovery of the fragment drives forward momentum, with flashbacks and decoding creating a loose A-to-B arc. Pacing is dense but coherent; logical gaps (e.g., origin of the shared sequence) disrupt clean resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The workshop’s “hushed tapes” and “decaying” atmosphere evoke a tactile, cerebral mood, while island memories contrast with “turquoise waves” and “salt.” Sensory details are vivid but unevenly distributed, favoring setting over character embodiment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., chaos as a table to “read”) elevate tension; the stabilizer’s twist subverts weaponized expectations. The finale’s “hope from fragments” theme resonates, but emotional impact is dulled by minimal dialogue and reliance on descriptive abstraction over tangible stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Attempts at lyricism (“hammered repose,” “circuitous pathways”) border on pretentious. Overuse of “fragmented,” “chaos,” and “trust” risks fatigue. Characters act logically but lack idiosyncratic unpredictability; subtext about trauma and surveillance remains underdeveloped amidst technical jargon.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Premise and setting form a cohesive skeleton, but thematic cohesion falters—questions about ethics, surveillance, and redemption hover uncommitted. The workshop’s role and “fragments vs. wholeness” ideas are conceptually rich but underexploited in the constrained space.</comment>
