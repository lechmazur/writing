<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's aimlessness is subtly tied to her quest for meaning through tactile connection to her grandmother, but her internal conflict remains more hinted at than fully realized. Motivation to preserve culture intertwines with personal loss yet lacks depth in showing how her "factually imaginative" mind actively processes the cipher beyond surface revelations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Linear progression from discovery to action is logical but occasionally abrupt in emotional beats (e.g., tears/growth moment feels slightly generic). Ending ties to the opening through the handkerchief, but the stove ignition-to-revelation sequence glosses over physical/metallic steps in the recipe testing process.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archive's physical textures—cracked spines, frost, fire—create a palpable atmosphere where memory and decay coexist. Snowflake's melting as a revelation trigger veers toward poetic overreach; the setting's purpose as both prison and library to forgotten knowledge is powerful but under-extended.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic focus on invisible cultural preservation through mundane objects; the hopscotch-as-oral-history metaphor resonates. Subtext about embedding resilience in play spaces is evocative, but emotional crescendo feels engineered rather than organically earned through layered interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in repurposing hopscotch as linguistic cipher and connecting culinary practice to identity survival. Prose occasionally risks melodrama ("whispers of the overlooked") but mostly maintains restrained elegance. Emotional truth emerges through specific actions (transcribing onto the grandmother's cloth) rather than abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Structure holds together despite packed elements; the archive-to-courtyard movement lacks transitional clarity but ends on a thematically resonant closure. The handkerchief-as-receptacle device unifies disparate components, though the "aimless traveler" trope strains against the specificity of her mission.</comment>
