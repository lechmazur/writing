<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elias's solitude and motivation are clear but lack layered development; his actions consistently align with his traits, yet his voice remains static without depth beyond the established gothic archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a clear arc via game rounds, but the party invitation disrupts coherence; triumph over despair lacks escalation, relying on symbolic resolution rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with icy sensory details, but the frost giant’s lair and board game mechanics are underexplained; the setting supports mood more than plot logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery and metaphor are effective (black rose, game as despair’s battle), but dialogue feels contrived; the ending reinforces theme but lacks emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on gothic tropes (black rose, solitary scholar) with minimal subversion; prose leans into ornate description (“seldom odd devotion”) without adding unique emotional resonance beyond expected melancholy.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong cohesion in theme and imagery, but the party invitation and despair-as-game mechanics feel artificial; the ending resolves the plot but undersells philosophical depth.</comment>
