<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's dual identity as trickster-turned-guardian is established but lacks psychological depth; motivations are clear but underexplored; moments of cleverness align with traits, but inner conflict feels underdeveloped despite the gift tag symbolism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot uses cryptic dares as efficient conflict drivers; pacing remains tight; cause-effect between dares and linguistic salvage operations is logical; arc compressed but complete, though the ending leans on thematic repetition more than narrative resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Biodome's sensory details (humidity, glass partition) create atmosphere, but Martian setting's implications for language preservation feel shallow; lichen as linguistic metaphor is original but underutilized; atmosphere complements tone but lacks immersive depth.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (lichen-as-language) and imagery (glass partition fogging with breath) are potent; theme of preservation as defiance against erasure is poignant; ending reinforces motif without redundancy; subtext in "ghostly resolve" elevates emotional resonance beyond surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through linguistic preservation angle, but "ghostly resolve" leans on familiar tropes; sensory details are specific yet occasionally overwrought ("vanishing voices"); rivals' taunts and Silas's countermeasures suggest ingenuity but border on contrived; prose balances clarity with lyricism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assigned elements are organically woven into Silas's mission; the biodome and dares create narrative momentum rather than feeling imposed; brevity enhances urgency; combines preservationist ethics with sci-fi in thought-provoking ways; leaves lingering questions about legacy vs. survival.</comment>
