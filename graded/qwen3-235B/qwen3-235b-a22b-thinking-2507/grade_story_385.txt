<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's manipulation is clear but underdeveloped; her "pleasant" side isn't shown beyond exposition. Motivation is consistent but lacks depth in emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Abstract progression relies heavily on metaphor; some connections (seeds/skates) feel contrived. The arc resolves thematically but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The obsidian skyscraper and pre-dawn setting create a haunting atmosphere. Shadows and sensory details (cold skates, shifting light) immerse readers in the story’s ephemeral tone.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich symbolism (footprints, seeds) and layered subtext about impermanence elevate the narrative. Ending is poetic, but emotional resonance is diminished by abstractness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (shifting symbols as transient truths) avoid cliché. Language is occasionally ornate but purposeful. Nuanced emotional subtext emerges through atmosphere, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Elements are tightly integrated but unevenly weighted; some (skates, weakening) are central, while others (seeds, skyscraper) feel symbolic overkill without full thematic payoff.</grade>
