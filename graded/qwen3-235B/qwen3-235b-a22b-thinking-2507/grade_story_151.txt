<question>1</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character lacks emotional depth or personal contradictions; motivation shifts are dictated by abstract philosophy rather than human psychology. The "rationally organic" attribute feels more like a concept imposed on the character than an organic trait shaping decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a symbolic arc but relies on dense exposition to compress structure. Action (destroying idol) is clear but resolution feels abrupt, with cause-effect logic leaning heavily on metaphor over narrative momentum. Word limit exposes underdeveloped turning points.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setting has chilling, vivid imagery but struggles with thematic anchoring—coldness dominates atmosphere without meaningfully challenging the character. Sensory details are polished but occasionally prioritize style over functional worldbuilding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (snowflakes, veil) provide intellectual stimulation, but emotional ambiguity undermines thematic payoff. Ending’s symbolic "resolution" feels logically sound yet narratively hollow due to minimal tension with character stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some phrases border on overcrafted ("shifting ice groaned like dread") but avoid outright clichés. The philosophical core adds originality, though the clinical tone and lack of flawed human logic occasionally flatten the story’s pulse into something algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Conceptually ambitious but sacrifices narrative tension for thematic density. Cohesion between elements exists at a superficial level, but the story’s intellectualized approach to emotion weakens its potential to resonate beyond conceptual admiration.</comment>
