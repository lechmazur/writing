<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's whimsy serves her function but lacks emotional depth; motivation to chronicle decay is clear but under-developed in relation to her personal stakes or inner conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Meandering without a defined arc; atmospheric progression outweighs structural clarity. The brushstroke's delayed culmination feels intentional but under-resolves narrative tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stalactite palace and fungal lighting create a coherent, haunting beauty; sensory details immersive but occasionally overladen, risking thematic dilution.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (thermometer as mortality chronicle, sculpted mist as impermanence) resonate powerfully; conclusion's self-reflexive artistry elevates the subtextual urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Unique premise avoids genre templates but occasionally overwrites with elaborate phrasing and self-consciously poetic abstractions rather than distilled precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Moments of lyrical cohesion outweigh uneven pacing and underdeveloped character interiority; strong conceptual fusion but execution falls short of transcendent.</comment>
