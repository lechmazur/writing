<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character has distinct emotional arc and symbolic motivations, but psychological depth remains archetypal; voice lacks completely individualized speech patterns that would make Kael feel more than a vessel for theme</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pivotal action of reverse-engineering drives the plot; beginning/end echo through the phone's silenced static, with internal/external journeys dovetailing logically; pacing maintains momentum without sacrificing emotional beats</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Immersive sensory integration of floating orchards and nebula penetration create vivid atmosphere; mycelium/ship symbiosis underutilized; tone balances melancholy and transcendence effectively</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Layered metaphors (soil/cracks as self-acceptance) work synergistically with organic imagery to create thematic resonance; dialogue remains purposeful despite slight on-the-nose phrasing; emotional impact lingers beyond final lines</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Omits overt formula but contains minor overly-poetic descriptions ("stellar winds promised migration"); some metaphors verge on familiar ("cracks where light enters"), though sci-fi horticultural fusion offers genuine originality; subtext avoids predictability</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>All elements seamlessly interconnected; each assigned component actively builds character, theme and setting; length feels purposefully compressed; final line's tonal resonance suggests artistic maturity beyond mere concept-checklist fulfillment</comment>
