<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation and traits are consistent (impulse, whimsy, emotional inheritance) but lacks nuance in inner conflict; actions align with motives but depth is sacrificed to brevity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear arc from quest to resolution; pacing is tight but sacrifices complexity; abrupt emotional shifts slightly undermine narrative flow within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evocative, sensorially rich atmosphere; setting actively shapes mood and stakes; waterfall/fortress interplay with melody is particularly resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</comment>The consistently whimsical prose (fireflies, "roaring harmony") blends with emotional subtext; lyrical metaphors and restorative theme elevate impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Imaginative core with fresh mythic undertones; some overly ornate phrasing ("damp air... still singing") risks purple prose, minor tonal inconsistency in character logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong cohesion; elements work in concert (e.g., stars/fortress/inheritance all reinforce theme); brevity occasionally flattens subtext but final image lingers memorably.</comment>
