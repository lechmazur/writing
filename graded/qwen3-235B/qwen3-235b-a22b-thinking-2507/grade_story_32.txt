<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological complexity; motivation is bluntly stated rather than organically revealed through action or internal conflict. The "grim sentinel" feels more like a symbolic trope than a lived-in consciousness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but logic collapses under scrutiny. The coin toss melody method feels arbitrary rather than earned. Pacing rushes through complex concepts that require deeper exploration to maintain coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ghost town imagery creates strong initial atmosphere, but sensory details remain superficial. The "simulation" concept underutilizes environmental paradoxes to deepen the illusionary setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elegantly layered metaphors ("gilded cage," "sonic architecture") create resonance. Strong central conflict and evocative closing. Lacks emotional connection to protagonist's struggle despite stylistic excellence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Excessive ornate phrasing borders on purple prose. The simulation narrative is overly familiar despite musical escape mechanic. Relies on stating emotions ("weight of remembering") rather than dramatizing them.</comment>
