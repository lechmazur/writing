<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's restlessness is hinted at but underdeveloped; her shift from mender to rebel lacks visceral personal stakes or introspective depth. Motivational threads (hope, legacy) are implied but rely on underexplored inner conflict. Administrator's softened reaction feels abrupt, sacrificing emotional complexity for convenience.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Narrative momentum builds through tactile details and symbolic actions but falters in compressing transformation's societal impact into limited space. The administrator's pivotal moment requires narrative shortcuts that prioritize thematic payoff over organic character interaction. Final resolution feels earned but overly condensed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dusty Mars biodome atmosphere is competently sketched with functional sensory details (crumbling structures, artificial atmosphere's hum) but rarely transcends functional worldbuilding. Martian elements (lichen tapestries, red plains) feel curated rather than organically integrated into surviving culture.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose layers themes of impermanence and collective memory through textile-art-as-reclamation metaphor. Subtle interplay between "cautious abandon" and "earnestly deceptive" motifs creates philosophical tension. Emotional beats sometimes rely on conceptual poetry rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Some phrases ("threadbare repairs," "dust devils") show intentional craft, while others ("resilient green shoots") verge on sentimental cliche. Avoids overt formula but occasionally substitutes lyrical abstraction for concrete character psychology. Subversion of AI-clichés present but uneven in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Limited space strains narrative expansion—societal implications of art, political risks, and communal transformation feel compressed into metaphor rather than dramatized. Conceptual cohesion outweighs dramatic completeness, maintaining structural integrity while sacrificing deeper exploration.</comment>
