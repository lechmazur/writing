<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character traits are present but lack deeper exploration; motivations are clear but could show more conflict; connection between her awkwardness and the doll is effective but under-developed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight structure within word limit; action drives the plot cohesively, but the transition from discovery to artistic method feels slightly rushed despite logical foundation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Rich sensory immersion through bioluminescent bay and star charts; setting deeply tied to themes and visual metaphors; atmosphere flawlessly reinforces fragility and memory.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism and theme; emotional resonance is intellectual rather than visceral; ending lacks a piercing emotional climax but succeeds as contemplative closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Original premise, but some phrasing borders on poetic abstraction; avoids many clich√©s but occasionally leans on familiar motifs (e.g., "quiet understanding"); metaphors are largely fresh but not revolutionary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</question><comment>Impeccably crafted but not flawless; elements serve the story with minor friction; brevity feels intentional, leaving a lingering philosophical echo without feeling constrained.</comment>
