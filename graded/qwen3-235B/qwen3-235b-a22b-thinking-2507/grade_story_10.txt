<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's rigidity and fatal flaw are explicit but his role as a duelist isn't deeply integrated into the emotional arc beyond metaphorical symbolism. Motivation (forgiveness, legacy) feels secondary to thematic concept rather than driving action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear redemption arc with tight pacing, but the journey to the chest feels under-explained. The server room hum bookends the story well but the 500-word span leaves emotional beats slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport provides a strong tactile atmosphere with permacrete, maggots, and server hum. The setting's decay mirrors the character's emotional state and corrupted recipes, though deeper exploration of "spaceport customs" as a legacy site could enhance specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imagery like "bitterness' decay" and mutated recipes as metaphor achieves emotional resonance. The final whisper feels earned rather than forced, though some emotional shifts rely on explicit statements ("grief-stricken") rather than full subtextual realization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining space opera gravitas with culinary preservation. Language avoids excessive ornamentation, though phrases like "precisely innovative care" stretch plausibility. Emotions are primarily shown through objects/actions rather than being directly stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story's emotional core transcends its constraints, but some elements (duelist identity, server room significance) feel imposed rather than organically integrated. The brevity amplifies the haunting question of legacy vs. adaptation across space/time.</comment>
