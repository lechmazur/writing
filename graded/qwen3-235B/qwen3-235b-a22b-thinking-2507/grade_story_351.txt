<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lacks emotional depth and interiority despite strong physical imagery; motivations implied through action but remain emotionally abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in "undoing as restoration" conceit; occasionally veers into over-ornamented prose that obscures emotional authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce around memory-as-act; pacing serves contemplative tone but risks stasis; ending offers thematic weight over narrative closure.</comment>
