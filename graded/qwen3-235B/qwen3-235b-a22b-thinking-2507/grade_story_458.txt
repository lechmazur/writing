<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Limited emotional depth prevents motivations from feeling fully earned; actions align with traits but lack nuanced internal conflict beyond thematic abstraction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Binary decision structure creates narrative completeness but pacing fractures under compressed logic; cause-effect between coffee stains and worm mechanics is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in decaying grandeur imagery but underutilizes worldbuilding potential; sensory details evoke mood without connecting to broader societal context.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractal sorrow, secular sacred) and symbolic tension between preservation/sacrifice resonate powerfully; ending maintains thematic coherence despite brevity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overused decay tropes undercut uniqueness; "fractal sorrow" veers toward conceptual abstraction; emotional beats occasionally rely on telling rather than visceral showing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cohesion emerges from thematic consistency but suffers from schematic construction; every element present yet feels assembled rather than organically developed.</comment>
