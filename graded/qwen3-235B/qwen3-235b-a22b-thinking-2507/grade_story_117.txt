<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character traits are well-integrated, but motivation lacks depth; the blend of wisdom and absurdity feels conceptually rich but emotionally opaque.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong with satisfying circularity (frost to dew), though the progression of resolving multiple "realities" within the word limit strains credibility slightly.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Absorbing, tactile atmosphere with sensory mastery (e.g., "crocuses pushed through snow"), though the winter-melting metaphor borders on overused symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Powerful subtext about healing through art; poetic devices (e.g., "wisdom wore folly's cloak") elevate thematic resonance, though some imagery risks pretentiousness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unique integration of abstract concepts with minimal clich√©; avoids overt formulaicity but occasionally sacrifices emotional nuance for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of elements into a cohesive allegory with lingering thematic resonance; risks slight overwriting but generally transcendent.</comment>
