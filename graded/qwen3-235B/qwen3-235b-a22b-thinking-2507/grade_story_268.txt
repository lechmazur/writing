<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (war guilt/redemption) is clear but could have more earned emotional nuance; reactions to the bead and assigned "artfully clumsy" trait reveal nuanced behavior, but backstory about razed village risks exposition over showing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows coherently within constraints; assigned action (tracking mirror distortions) drives tension logically, and the mirrored surveillance ties neatly to the ancient art's requirements; resolution feels purposeful but slightly abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned waiting area) and timeframe (virtual calls) create a claustrophobic, timeless mood; sensory details like rain and coffee smells enhance immersion; screaming silence as tone contrasts effectively with action.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong imagery and symbolism (mirror distortions as metaphor for perception) elevate the narrative; ending resonates with theme of cyclical violence; dialogue is terse yet meaningful; tension between stillness and impending violence is visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés (e.g., mirror-walking is inventive), but vigilante clichés and overly ornate phrases like "screaming silence" approach familiar territory; emotional resonance relies on subtext more than explicit statements but occasionally slips into telling.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work together cohesively; the brevity doesn't hinder a complete arc; leaves lasting thematic questions about perception and redemption; style choices enhance mood rather than distract.</comment>
