<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (rebellion against collective grief) is clear and drives action, but Sheriff Thorne’s interiority remains thin beyond his resolve. His role as "small-town sheriff" leans on trope without enough idiosyncratic voice to transcend archetype.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent investigative arc from library to decision to depart, but the tight word limit leaves cause-and-effect relationships underdeveloped (e.g., meteorite connection feels abrupt). Pacing is uneven between dense description and sudden resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting blends science and poetry inventively, with vivid sensory details (frozen constellations, vaulted equations), but the "scientific poetry library" strains plausibility. Atmosphere dominates over character/environment interaction, creating static tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("echo of quiet") and thematic resonance between celestial imagery and grief stand out. Emotional subtext is implied through setting more than showing; ending’s metaphorical weight elevates the piece despite its brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Some phrases ("ghostly resolve," "clue defeat that entire dirge") verge on overwritten. The central conceit (scientific library) feels original but risks feeling like a curated gimmick. Subtext about grieving vs. clinging to ghosts is human but thinly executed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</question><grade>Elements combine cleverly (chain as relic, stars as clues), but the rigid adherence to assigned elements creates a mosaic without emotional cohesion. The self-serious tone resonates but leaves lingering questions about the astronomer’s fate unresolved in a way that feels intentional, if unsatisfying.</comment>
