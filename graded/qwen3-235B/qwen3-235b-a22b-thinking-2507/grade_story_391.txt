<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character lacks layered complexity; "roguish" traits are superficial, motivation implied but inner conflict underdeveloped. Reaction to carvings reveals intellectual drive but no emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect logic holds, however the 500-word limit strains the transition from discovery to revolutionary plan.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Richly textured underwater setting through sensory details (silted piano, humming carvings) and mood; the piano's silence vs. anticipated melody creates tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (apron holding thought-tools, consciousness blueprints) elevate craft; ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact diluted by abstract descriptions of revolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s with driftwood consciousness concept but falters with overused phrases ("yearning for purpose"); tonal consistency maintained despite some purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a functional narrative, but brevity flattens thematic exploration; the piano as broadcasting device feels conceptually inventive rather than organically earned.</comment>
