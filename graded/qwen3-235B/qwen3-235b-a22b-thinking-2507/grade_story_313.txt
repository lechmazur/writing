<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's guilt and cynical defiance are palpable, but motivations are implied rather than deeply explored. The 'unusually normal' trait is effective but underutilized narratively.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Non-linear structure emphasizes emotional states over plot progression. Pacing is deliberate but slightly hinders narrative momentum within tight word count constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Radiation-scarred farm setting is visceral through precise details (stunted corn, hydroponic shed looting) that directly inform character choices and thematic decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Meta-commentary on guilt-as-haunting elevated by lyrical prose. The mechanical 'spinning dispenser' gesture as symbolic defiance demonstrates profound thematic precision.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts AI-clich√©s with idiosyncratic metaphors ('ghostly apparitions' as manifestation of guilt). Avoids emotional overstatement while maintaining human nuance in self-delusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements cohere into a visceral portrait of cyclical corruption. The brevity serves as narrative feature rather than limitation, though emotional arcs could achieve greater complexity.</comment>
