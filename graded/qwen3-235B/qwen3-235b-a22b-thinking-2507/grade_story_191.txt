<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is mostly clear but lacks deeper emotional exploration; the link between Silas's guilt and his method (ink well) is underdeveloped, though the grudging admiration adds complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently within constraints, with a coherent arc from analysis to realization, but the condensed resolution feels abrupt; the timeframe's role is conceptually strong but slightly compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Mist-shrouded setting and sensory details (e.g., silenced sea, cold coffee) create an immersive, thematically resonant atmosphere that amplifies character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (ink well as self-reflection) and layered themes (redemption, shared guilt) shine; ending delivers emotional resonance while avoiding cliche.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some poetic phrasing works, but the ink well's supernatural functionality veers into quasi-mechanical logic; subversion of Silas's expectations adds novelty, but not fully transcendent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Assigned elements are largely cohesive and purposeful, though a few (ink well, cameo analysis) rely on abstract logic; thematic depth and atmospheric unity elevate overall cohesion.</comment>
