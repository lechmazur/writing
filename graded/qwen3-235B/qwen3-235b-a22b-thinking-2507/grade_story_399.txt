<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's grumpiness is consistent but lacks nuanced behavioral demonstration; internal monologue reveals depth, yet external actions insufficiently manifest emotional conflict beyond static contemplation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively through symbolic progression rather than physical action; the mandala's patterns drive subtle character change, though external stakes remain ephemeral despite effective compression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory synthesis of cold, starlight, and shifting sand creates immersive dissonance between decay and mysticism; the setting's esoteric qualities flawlessly mirror the protagonist's fractured psyche.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Profound emotional resonance through metaphor (jiggling tube as trauma echo, mandala as integration); theme of trauma-as-navigation is thought-provoking, though some declarative statements undercut subtextual potency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</question><comment>Originality in mystical reconciliation of grief; occasional overreliance on abstract terms ("multiply singular") and slightly overpolished prose rhythms reduce visceral impact compared to raw thematic material.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a meditative whole; the brevity serves thematic compression rather than feeling limiting, though narrative momentum leans too heavily on symbolic framework rather than character-specific stakes.</comment>
