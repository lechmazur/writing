<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s role as "unknowing heir" shapes her actions thematically but lacks nuanced inner conflict; her motivation (quiet hunger) is clear but not fully earned through emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a coherent arc but relies on abrupt realizations; pacing falters slightly in emotional buildup, leaving some transitions feeling underdeveloped despite efficient use of word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels with rich sensory details (projector sputter, cracked windows) and tone-setting; the magnetic mountain’s unseen presence is evocative but underexplored structurally.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful imagery (murals as living legacy) and metaphor (spoon as key) elevate the narrative; the ending’s resolution feels thematically cohesive and emotionally resonant despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Original metaphors ("churning cold butter") and symbolic depth avoid cliché; tone consistency wavers slightly with occasional overwrought phrases like "frolicsome regret," but voice remains distinct and purposeful.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>Creative integration of elements (spoon, murals, mountain) drives thematic cohesion; length enhances brevity but risks underdeveloped character nuance, slightly diluting lingering impact.</grade>
