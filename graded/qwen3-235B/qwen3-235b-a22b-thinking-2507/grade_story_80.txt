<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s transformation from “ingeniously clueless” to enlightened is conceptually strong, but her internal conflict lacks depth; her actions are plot-driven over psychologically convincing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The logs-as-countdown reveal is compelling, but the resolution feels rushed; the logic of the coaster’s eroding track ties to the theme but strains under narrative brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (rust bleeding into twilight, shrieking metal) create a haunting atmosphere, though the roller coaster’s symbolic connection to the inn remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of the logs as a fragile boundary is clever, and the ending lingers, but emotional resonance is undercut by overreliance on abstract phrases like “weight lifting.”</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Originality in linking logs to cosmic stakes, but phrases like “quiet mania” and “spectral heart” verge on cliché; character reasoning occasionally feels logically imposed rather than organically felt.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>The story’s ambition exceeds its grasp; cohesion falters in connecting coaster to inn thematically, but the riddle’s cosmic scale and eerie tone linger despite some contrived elements.</grade>
