<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivation (outrunning prophecy) is compelling and consistent, but the guide remains somewhat enigmatic; his "unsettled" nature is shown through frantic actions, but deeper psychological complexity or personal history is absent.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear trajectory driven by aligning the box, with cause-effect logic intact. The reversal mechanic drives momentum, though the transition from hallway to beach feels abrupt; ending achieves resolution while leaving room for thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seashell and beach are vividly rendered with sensory precision (humming interiors, "protective thrum"), creating a haunting, mythic atmosphere. Timeframe (after photo in hallway) anchors the urgency but is underdeveloped compared to the rich beach setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor ("reversed wishes," shifting architecture), lyrical prose, and subtext about accidental salvation. Ending eschews cliché heroism, but emotional depth could be more nuanced; relies partially on poetic abstraction over visceral human stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes through inversion (freedom via surrender), but similes like "architectural heart beating" occasionally border on overused. Stylistic flourishes enhance rather than overwhelm; tone remains cohesive despite density.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegantly synthesizes elements (prophecy, reversed wishes, seashell) into a thematically cohesive whole. The short form enhances the story’s mythic tone rather than detracting; raises questions about fate versus agency that linger beyond the final line.</comment>
