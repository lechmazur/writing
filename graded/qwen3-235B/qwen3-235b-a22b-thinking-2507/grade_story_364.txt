<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara's 'skewed vision' shapes her archival mission but remains abstract; motivations are poetically stated yet lack visceral emotional underpinning. Her advisory role lacks psychological complexity despite symbolic coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progresses through temporal surges and glyph-reading, but the resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect (e.g., photo stabilizing time) hinges on underdeveloped mechanics. Pacing falters in the workshop sequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vibrant tactile details like "flickering amber light" and "ink blooming into cherry blossoms" create haunting atmosphere. The silent revolution's creeping mechanization contrasts poignantly with organic decay imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (fern fronds/mending time) and symbolic layering (trade = botanical essence) elevate beyond fantasy tropes. The ending transcends sentimentality through paradoxical imagery of loss-as-rebirth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids genre conventions by reframing time anomalies through craft preservation. Some phrasing ("mundane miracles") risks preciousness, but glyph logic and botanical chronotopics feel singular and purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Compelling thematic unity exists between elements, though the forced equation of trades/species feels schematic. Brevity amplifies poetic resonance but sacrifices deeper exploration of key transitions.</comment>
