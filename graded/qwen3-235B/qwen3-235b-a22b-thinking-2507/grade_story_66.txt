<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Well-connected character traits and motivations, but emotional evolution feels distilled without deeper psychological complexity; actions align with assigned elements yet lack dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot coherence suffers from compressed progression; pivotal moments (mask revelation, carbonizing ritual) lack rhythmic breathing room, though the concept-to-resolution arc is conceptually sound.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Evocative but unevenly weighted descriptions—oaks and cracked mirror shine, but the plant communication study remains underexplored, diluting thematic resonance of the scientific setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Striking metaphorical alchemy elevates theme; "carbonizing memory" as both literal and emotional transformation is potent, though occasional ornate phrasing risks undercutting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Avoids total predictability but occasionally leans on familiar trauma-redemption arcs; sensory details like "green syllables" strike fresh, while "foolish hope" teeters on cliché edge.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Element integration varies: mask ritual and carbonizing action are indispensable, but plant communication study and jigsaw puzzles feel partially instrumentalized rather than organically vital.</comment>
