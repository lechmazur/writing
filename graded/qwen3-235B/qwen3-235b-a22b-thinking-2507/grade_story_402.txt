<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but inner conflict lacks depth; gestures and rituals imply solitude but personality remains abstract, relying on atmospheric details over emotional dimensionality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lacks traditional plot structure—focuses on a single ritualized moment. Pacing maintains tension but sacrifices narrative progression; coherence emerges through recurring symbolism rather than action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is visceral and original, with bone-tangled roots and mineral-encrusted glass creating tactile unease. Sensory details immerse reader, though some phrases ("cathedral of roots") verge on cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and metaphors (bottle as question mark, bones as cold promises) elevate impact. Quiet desperation permeates tone; ending resonates with existential ambiguity rather than resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Few formulaic elements; originality shines in merging biological decay with archival impulse. Some overused phrases ("unseen rocks," "weight of questions") undercut freshness, but subtext about communication vs. impermanence feels inventive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements like catacomb orchard and sign language add cohesion, but the story works despite, not because of, some assigned elements. Lingering impression comes from language rather than narrative structure.</comment>
