<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character is defined by assigned traits but lacks depth; actions align with motivations but voice isn't distinctive enough for literary excellence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc exists but pacing feels rushed; cause-effect connections (e.g., shadow movement leading to artifact) have logical gaps despite cohesion between crossword beginning/end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rich sensory details in lighthouse setting create strong atmosphere; however, the "waiting room" timeframe metaphor feels inorganic and disrupts cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Evocative prose, potent metaphors (shadow language, timber songs), and thematic resonance between past/present reach literary heights, though ending's crossword revelation slightly strains credibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original concept execution (navigating shadows as living lore) avoids clich√©s; poetic language remains purposeful without veering into purple prose; emotional subtext is earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic unity with lingering resonance about legacy and innovation; slight awkwardness in crossword-answer resolution and compressed arc weaken cohesion slightly.</comment>
