<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to embody values through symbolic action is clear but lacks depth in internal conflict; reactions to the mirror reveal some complexity but remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure uses the mirror discovery effectively to drive the climax, though the rapid transition from lull to resolution feels compressed within the word limit, slightly undermining pacing cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered (eerie graveyard, oppressive darkness) and deeply tied to thematic contrasts (light/darkness), though some sensory details verge on ornate without adding substantial tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Literary devices (e.g., mirror as metaphor for self-reflection, "unfermented wort" as stalled revolution) are potent; ending achieves symbolic resonance and emotional impact, though dialogue occasionally teeters into didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Original in blending protest imagery with brewing metaphors, but phrases like "encroaching darkness" and the mirror's visions risk clich√©; tone oscillates between lyrical and artificial, betraying occasional formulaic tics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story feels cohesive and purposefully concise; elements like the mirror and protest lull meaningfully intersect, though certain details (staircase discoloration) strain logic.</comment>
