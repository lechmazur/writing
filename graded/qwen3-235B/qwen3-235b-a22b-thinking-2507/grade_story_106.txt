<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's melancholic nature and tactile connection to stamps/objects reveal depth, but internal monologue relies heavily on explicit thematic statements rather than organic revelation through action or sensory engagement. Motivation shift from stagnation to action feels conceptually sound yet emotionally underdeveloped due to compressed timeline.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot follows clear progression from numbed maintenance to existential awakening via quilt metaphor. Tight word limit creates satisfying micro-arc through symbolic contrasts, though pivotal moment (quilt's realization) lacks physiological or environmental anchors that might make abstract insights feel earned rather than authorially imposed. Pacing taut but occasionally breathless.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Underwater decay saturated with haunting details: "corroded console" hum, algae-slick brass fittings, pressure-choked silence. Tactile contrasts (calloused hands vs fragile stamps) and visual motifs (fading light, threadbare quilt) masterfully create atmosphere of fragile endurance. All sensory modalities engaged to build existential weight within confined space.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphoric layering (stamps as boundary relics vs quilt's composite map) achieves compelling interplay between physical/emotional navigation. Subtext about inherited resilience through women's labor adds historical dimension. Language occasionally risks over-determination with phrases like "fluid reality" but mostly earns poeticism through grounded imagery. Confined to high-concept resolution but emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids AI clich√©s by tethering surreal elements to specific textures (quilt's denim-floral seam, algae-smoothed console). "Borrowed valor" offers fresh take on inherited courage rather than rote stoicism. Some transitional phrases ("sudden zest surged") border on mechanical shifts but mostly redeemed by physicalized metaphors anchoring abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Elements interwoven with thematic precision: submerged location embodies boundary dissolution; quilt's patches provide both method and existential model; stamps' obsolescence mirrors his outmoded worldview. Every assigned component serves dual purpose in plot, character, or theme with no extraneous elements. Final image (quilt pulsing with "dying energy") distills all assigned components into resonant unity.</comment>
