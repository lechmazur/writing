<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's traits of hesitance and awkwardness anchor his actions, but internal monologue edges into over-explanation; the hermit crab metaphor is effective but slightly labored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tight 3-act structure within constraints; pacing balances introspection and action, though the resolution feels slightly compressed despite logical progression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking, original setting with sensory cohesion—geothermal vents contrasted against tundra become a living metaphor for thematic tension; atmosphere amplifies both plot and character.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Stunning use of layered symbolism (sword/postcard/geothermal systems) and subtextual parallels; ending payoff is subtle yet resonant, avoiding schmaltz. The "show, don't tell" dominates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through existential dilemma and unconventional metaphors; some transitions ("bitterness melted as quickly as...") verge on lyrical cliché, but innovation outweighs formulaic tendencies.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Constraints are deftly woven into narrative DNA rather than feeling imposed; brevity enhances urgency but slightly dilutes emotional density in character-external relationships.</comment>
