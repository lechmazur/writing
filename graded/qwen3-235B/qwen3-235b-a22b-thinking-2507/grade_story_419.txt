<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character is defined through action and sparse introspection; "steadily free" lacks depth. Empathy shown via ritual, but motivation feels imposed rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Linear ritual drives plot but lacks narrative arc. Pacing steady yet static, resolving tension too easily. Concept shapes conclusion but undermines thematic weight by feeling abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels: haunting visuals (dust motes, fractured light) and sensory details immerse reader. Timeframe and setting symbiotically amplify loneliness and preservation theme.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (beating heart, heartbeat resonance) and lyrical prose create emotional resonance. Subtext about legacy and connection through ritual is impactful. Subtly challenges "haunted" trope by centering empathy over fear.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some ornate phrasing ("captured starlight") borders on purple prose. Tropes (haunted museum, last survivor) are mitigated by specific details but still familiar. Subtext elevates originality; emotional nuance feels slightly filtered rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cohesive execution of assigned elements with minimal redundancy. Brevity serves atmosphere, but themes and character depth are undercut by word limits. Lingering poignancy exists but lacks transformative impact.</comment>
