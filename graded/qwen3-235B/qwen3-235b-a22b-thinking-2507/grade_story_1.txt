<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Character traits are introduced but motivation remains superficial. Phobias drive action superficially, but no deeper psychological complexity emerges. The stunt double profession feels like a gimmick rather than integral to character identity. Reactions to objects lack emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through contrived connections: garage sale â†’ pyramid feels arbitrary. Knot-unraveling as resolution is thematically coherent but execution feels rushed. Pacing staggers between excessive description and underdeveloped transitions. The arc's transformation lacks earned emotional weight despite structural symmetry.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting details like decaying library air and tactile net descriptions create immersive atmosphere. Timeframe's sweltering summer contrasts with pyramid's cool darkness effectively. Sensory details elevate mundanely spiritual tone. Certain connections between objects and setting (e.g., net as fear manifestation) are strikingly executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (net/knots = phobias) provide layered meaning, but execution leans on surface-level poeticisms without deeper subtext. Ending's thematic resonance feels partially earned through rhythm rather than character transformation. Prose alternates between striking imagery and melodramatic abstraction. Central conflict resolution lacks textual grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Contains original metaphoric conceits but defaults to romanticized archaeology tropes. "Mundanely spiritual" attempts freshness but often becomes oxymoronic filler. Emotional beats sometimes reduced to explicit statements ("triumph surged"). Some AI-like flourishes: "laughter echoes in dark" trope avoided but rhythmically similar patterns detected. Metaphor density occasionally suffocates narrative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Story maintains cohesion through thematic linking of ordinary/sacred dichotomies. Some elements (stunt double profession) remain vestigial, suggesting template-filling rather than narrative necessity. Brief form is mostly effective but sacrifices character depth. Lingering resonance derives from metaphor rather than narrative architecture.</comment>
