<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character's insomnia and botanical collection are well-tied to personality, but transformation from observer to active choice-maker feels conceptually compressed rather than organically revealed.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is logically sound with symbolic arc, but the pivotal revelation about whispers feels conceptually dense for the limited word count, slightly undercutting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory details (crumbling ledgers, bourbon, lavender) create immersive atmosphere where botanical decay and attic claustrophobia mirror psychological states.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of botanical ciphers, layered subtext about violence-as-laziness, and sonic precision of phrases like "quiet insistence of understanding" elevate the craft.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through the botanical evidence map and non-violence-as-action framework; the whisper's transformation from supernatural to psychological is clever but slightly precocious.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><grade>Elements serve thematic unity without feeling forced; the brevity amplifies the storyâ€™s meditation on stillness as active resistance, though some connections require reader inference.</grade>
