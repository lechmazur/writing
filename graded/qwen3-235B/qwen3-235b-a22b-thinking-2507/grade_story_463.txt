<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear motivation but lacks complexity; "dry-witted" trait remains superficial despite clever phrasing. Actions align with stated goals but depth suffers from compressed scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot achieves complete arc within constraints, but relies on familiar exorcism structure. Cause-effect logic holds, though pacing compresses key emotional beats too tightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere richly rendered with haunting sensory details, yet setting verges on gothic clich√©. The lighthouse's decay as metaphor functions but lacks subversive edge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance ("eroding promises"/rope) elevates narrative. Overreliance on lyrical exposition weakens immediacy despite striking imagery and thematic conclusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Originality in combining dance/confiscation exists, but metaphors tread familiar literary ground. Language occasionally veers into baroque territory without sufficient narrative pay-off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but lack nuanced execution. The lighthouse sentinel trope combines with dance tradition in intriguing ways that feel slightly underdeveloped despite cohesive skeleton.</comment>
