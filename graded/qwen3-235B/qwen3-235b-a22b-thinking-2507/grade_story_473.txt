<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation is thematically clear but relies too heavily on internal monologue; nuances of his duality between cartography and leadership feel underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot coherence holds within the word limit, but the conflict's resolution feels overly deterministic without sufficient emotional payoff for the sacrifices hinted at.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting juxtaposes industrial and natural elements effectively; solar glare as a metaphor for progress overshadows the more underdeveloped sensory textures of the orchard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (pruning as resisting fate) sustain thematic resonance; ending balances stoicism and melancholy, though dialogue remains sparse to its detriment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose contains vivid but occasionally overwritten passages ("sun-weathered face..."); the Guild's secrecy borders on melodrama while avoiding full immersion in clich√©.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lean on symbolic scaffolding; the brevity masks shallow thematic scaffolding beneath the lyrical surface.</comment>
