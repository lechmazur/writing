<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's anxiety and detachment are established but not deeply explored; her sudden boldness strains plausibility despite consistent motivation to transcend mundanity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Linear progression works within constraints, but pacing stumbles slightly in the middle; the symbolic death of the candle as a temporal anchor feels forced and contrived.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Microbe-fed bioluminescence and smog-choked dome create vivid, thematically rich decay; the bacteria-city’s organic rhythm as a metaphor for stagnant civilization elevates immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Striking imagery like "fermentation-scented air" resonates, but heavy reliance on predictable metaphors ("stage," "song") weakens impact; emotional subtext often declared rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose alternates between evocative and overwrought; "terrorizing void" feels inflated; the bacteria-city’s mechanics are original but the star pattern method leans on familiar escape tropes without sufficient innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Cohesion exists but lacks transcendence; elements serve plot rather than deeper thematic fusion – the bacteria-city’s decay isn't meaningfully tied to Elara’s inner transformation.</comment>
