<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Presents a symbol of rebellion through action but offers minimal psychological depth. Motivation is clear but primarily externalized through ritualistic gestures rather than interior complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Linear, repetitive action creates cyclical tension but lacks traditional narrative arc. Pacing aligns with theme of slow perseverance; some forced metaphors disrupt cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid visual language establishes eerie atmosphere but leans heavily on familiar apocalyptic tropes. Sensory details unevenly distributed, focusing excessively on sight at the expense of other senses.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective use of cyclical imagery and metaphysical symbolism elevates theme, though emotional resonance remains intellectualized rather than visceral. Conceptual richness occasionally undermines immediacy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrases ("celestial fire") border on purple prose. Subverts post-apocalyptic expectations through quiet defiance but struggles with abstract consistency in technical descriptions (e.g., light translation mechanics).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stylistic polish and conceptual elegance outweigh minor inconsistencies, but lacks transcendent emotional stakes or narrative surprise required for top-tier impact. Premise overstays its length slightly.</comment>
