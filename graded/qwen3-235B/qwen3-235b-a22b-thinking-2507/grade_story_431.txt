<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's introversion and former dancer identity shape her actions meaningfully, but her inner life remains stylized and emotionally distant; the character feels more like a symbolic construct than a living human, though this is partly intentional within the tone.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A tightly focused plot arc emerges through the discovery of the coherent signal, but the transition from decoding to departure feels underdeveloped despite the constraints; momentum builds logically but resolves with minimal emotional or narrative weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The toxic Earth and confined office setting create a suffocating atmosphere intensified by tactile details (brittle charts, dust motes, wool texture); the worldbuilding leans on post-apocalyptic tropes but elevates them through precise, tactile specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Description-heavy but purposeful prose uses metaphor (static as coordinates, dance as memory) to blend technical and poetic registers; the ending's quiet agency and subversion of "triumphant escape" add thematic resonance; minor over-reliance on italicized motifs.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing; metaphors (ash as snow, heart as metronome) are fresh within their contexts; tone remains consistent; emotional nuance is implied through subtext rather than explicit statement; no mechanical repetitions detected.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work in concert without feeling contrived; the brevity feels earned rather than restrictive; themes of fragile hope and adaptive survival resonate beyond the text; secondary details like the final ballet hint at untapped depth but remain underexplored.</comment>
