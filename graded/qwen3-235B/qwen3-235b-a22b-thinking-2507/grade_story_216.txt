<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Thorne's role as a scapegoat is intellectually consistent, but his inner psychology feels underdeveloped beyond surface traits. His actions align with his assigned role, but motivations lack visceral emotional grounding, relying on exposition over lived experience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot maintains tight causality, but the resolution feels overly procedural. The midpoint's symbol decoding is compelling, yet fails to build significant narrative tension or emotional stakes within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cloud city's atmosphere is evocative through brass bellows, levitation struts, and gas-lamp refractions. Sensory details are specific but occasionally verge on ornamental rather than psychologically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors like the washer-as-identity resonate powerfully. The theme of fragile equilibrium between truth and systems is intellectually satisfying. Some existential musings risk feeling preordained rather than organically revealed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through unique combinations (scapegoat + steampunk engineering). Language balances precision with poetic restraint. Subtext about institutional corruption and identity dissolution suggests human thematic engagement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole. Technical jargon serves worldbuilding without overwhelming narrative flow. Leaves resonant questions about complicity and historical erasure.</comment>
