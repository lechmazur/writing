<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation (celestial patterns shaping terrestrial beauty) is clear and consistent, but Aiko remains underdeveloped, her reactions telegraphed rather than psychologically nuanced. The "distant intimacy" between characters feels imposed rather than organically earned through interaction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pacing manages to establish a closed loop between Kenji's action (repositioning camellias) and Aiko's artistic response within the constraint, but the meteor shower's influence on plant cycles lacks internal logic, creating a plot hinge that feels speculative rather than grounded in the story's tactile atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stark sensory contrasts—moss-draped stones against indigo-silver paint, crumbling botanical archives versus glowing celestial patterns—create vivid immersion. The castle-as-art-school setting's thematic potential (martial art transformed into creative space) remains underexploited, though atmospheric details are exquisitely rendered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (pressed flowers as time's patience, meteor showers as celestial cipher) achieve lyrical precision. The ending's duality of silence-as-dialogue lingers powerfully. Subtext about ephemeral vs. rooted life resonates subtly, though emotional payoff relies disproportionately on poetic abstraction over concrete character interiority.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rich originality in merging herbalism with astronomic divination, but the prose occasionally deteriorates into ornamental abstraction ("ink-wash studios," "celestial fire") that obscures emotional grounding. The repositioning method feels like a borrowed mythological mechanism rather than an organic narrative invention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Narrative cohesion emerges from meticulous element interlocking (meteor patterns ➔ flower placement ➔ palette shifts), but the story leans too heavily on aesthetic symbolism at the cost of emotional immediacy. Lingering resonance exists in the intersection of natural and human cycles, however.</comment>
