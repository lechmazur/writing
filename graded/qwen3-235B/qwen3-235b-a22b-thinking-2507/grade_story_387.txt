<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's selflessness is established through action but lacks internal conflict or humanizing flaws; motivation is clear but one-dimensionally noble; her musicality drives the plot but lacks professional specificity to add depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Warped vinyl drives the conflict effectively; cause-effect between cosmic radiation damage and migratory anomaly is logical; pacing is taut but resolution feels abrupt; the cyclical use of the mark of trust in bookending scenes enhances structural cohesion within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Recycled ship's chimes create immersive, diegetic atmosphere; sensory details (tactile vinyl warmth, sonic storms) serve thematic longing; the salvaged setting meaningfully reflects the theme of repurposed brokenness; temporal scope of "centuries" is underdeveloped beyond references to the record's age.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elicits melancholic hope through metaphor-laden prose; the central motif of "mapping" as both literal cartography and emotional reconnection creates layered meaning; ending resonates by transforming technical mission into spiritual belonging; "showing" dominates with only slight overuse of poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Precise sensory details prevent complete genericism; some phrases ("intangibly tangible," "savagely graceful") risk pretentiousness; character psychology remains logically consistent despite selflessness trope; metaphors (whales/filters) are innovative but occasionally undercut by repetitive "centuries" motif; emotional beats are embedded in actions rather than explicitly stated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cohesively unifies elements through resonant sound motif; each assigned component contributes to the emotional arc; the brevity feels intentional with layered meaning compressed into key scenes; leaves a lingering thematic impression about preservation through sacrifice, though philosophical implications could penetrate deeper.</comment>
