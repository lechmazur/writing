<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's zealotry and internal conflict are well-etched through symbols (plush, coral) but his ideological shift feels slightly rushed despite effective use of the carnival prize as a moral anchor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot pivots smartly on the method/reversed echoes but relies on thin exposition for Vanya’s backstory; the compressed arc is coherent but slightly strained by its brevity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through nuanced moral ambiguity; prose leans toward ornate phrasing but retains clarity; emotional beats shown through subtext, not didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce cohesively, though the zealot-to-defector arc could be more visceral; concise length enhances thematic focus while prompting deeper reflection.</comment>
