<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character’s introversion is shown through sensory details and actions, but inner conflict remains abstract. Motivation drives minimal plot, not deep psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of discovery and realization, but the climax relies on thematic epiphany over narrative momentum. Pacing feels intentional but slightly static.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion—e.g., “spectral moss,” flickering fireflies, neon shadows—creates a haunting, layered atmosphere that defines the story’s emotional logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (CD as “key,” courage as fragmented persistence) deepen thematic resonance. The ending’s quiet defiance avoids sentimentality, offering a subdued yet potent emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Virtually no clichés; avoids stating emotions directly. Language is lush but purposeful, with fresh analogies like “ghostly applause.” Tone remains consistent and distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Highly cohesive; elements like fireflies, CD, and cathedral are interwoven to serve theme and tone. However, the abstract nature of “courage” risks vagueness despite strong execution.</comment>
