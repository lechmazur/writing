<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but psychological complexity remains underdeveloped; transformation from "juggler" to "keeper of bridges" feels thematically stated rather than earned through nuanced character progression</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Coherent arc but pacing uneven - critical steps in method/ritual (tea leaf interpretation mechanics) under-explained; connection between action (interpreting) and result (library resurrection) relies heavily on symbolic logic rather than narrative cause-effect</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid but inconsistent texture - drowning/light metaphors strong, yet void portrayed passively rather than as active opposing force; sensory details concentrated in visual imagery at expense of other senses</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density works both for and against - cultural bridge concept gains depth through multi-layered object symbolism, but emotional resonance diluted by near-constant symbolic abstraction</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls in concept, but some phrases like "muted euphoria" recur with mechanical repetition; emotional beats often translated through concept rather than lived character experience</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cohesive enough to function but element list approach to worldbuilding apparent; themes resonate but narrative intimacy suffers from abstract-concept prioritization</comment>
