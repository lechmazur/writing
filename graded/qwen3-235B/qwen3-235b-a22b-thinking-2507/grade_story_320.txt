<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s shyness and cosmic duty conflict but remain underexplored; their influence on her choices feels surface-level, relying on stated traits rather than nuanced behavior. Her "passionate disinterest" lacks integration with her actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plot’s tight arc hinges on the revelation via social media posts, but the leap from discovery to cosmic correction feels rushed. Parallel timelines clarify stakes but strain internal logic within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visually immersive with haunting underwater imagery; the algae’s glow, silt-covered stalls, and dissolved photographs create a melancholic tone. However, the parallel timelines and data conduits could use more tactile detail to root the reader.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The metaphor of regret as a cosmic force is poignant, and the quiet resolution avoids melodrama. However, the ending’s emotional resonance is diluted by over-reliance on abstract concepts (“cosmic imbalance”) rather than character introspection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Some phrasing (“echo of collective regret made manifest”) feels portentous. The underwater social media posts as “digital fossils” subvert expectations, but the “weary resolve” trope and vague cosmic terminology lean toward cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive under constraints, but the core concept (“echo of regret”) feels underexploited compared to the rich setting. The ending’s thematic closure satisfies but lacks lingering resonance beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
