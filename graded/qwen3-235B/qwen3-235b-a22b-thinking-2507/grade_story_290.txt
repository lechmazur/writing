<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's motivation to disrupt cosmic stillness is clear, but his emotional arc lacks depth; the "intelligently foolish" attribute drives the climax but isn't fully explored in shaping his worldview. Minimal direct dialogue weakens distinct voice establishment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates remarkable economy in a tight frame—every detail serves the overthrow sequence. Method of taxi-bound rebellion is cleverly logical within the story's metaphysical rules, though the final resolution leans heavily on poetic abstraction over narrative closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory details like "singing walls" and "rain's harmonic frequency" create strong atmospheric cohesion. However, post-apocalyptic setting lacks specific cultural/physical markers of the old empire, reducing historical weight that could enhance emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story resonates through subtextual exploration of power redistribution via collective vulnerability. Metaphors align tightly—figurine's fracture mirrors cosmic imbalance, taxi ride symbolizes microcosmic societal change. Some reliance on poetic abstraction weakens concrete thematic grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avant-garde structure avoids genre tropes but occasionally veers into mannerist prose ("measured wildness" recurs without earned significance). Figurine's inert power-to-activation shift feels conceptually familiar despite unique setting—too much "epiphany through object" without sufficient mechanical novelty.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>High-concept execution demonstrates editorial polish and thematic ambition, yet certain elements (harmonic resonance mechanics) require greater explanatory specificity or more committed symbolic treatment to transcend "meaningful vagueness" toward true cohesion.</comment>
