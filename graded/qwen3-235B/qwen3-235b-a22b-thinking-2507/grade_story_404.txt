<question>1</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Monk's motivation to capture cosmic event lacks emotional depth; "forged trust" only superficially explored through minimal dialogue; assigned traits ("cynical warmth") feel imposed rather than organically embodied in actions or voice. Methods tied to character are underexplained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot driven by key's resonance/crystal destruction, but the cosmic event feels arbitrarily timeboxed; method (melody-welding) explained through vague mystical jargon; narrative completeness achieved but feels condensed rather than naturally earned within word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dimension shop's sensory details create vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere; "cosmic static" and "impossible colors" contrast effectively with grimy setting; tone shifts between cynicism and gravitas work better than character work.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Harmonic repair as metaphor for trust shows promise; clich√©d phrases ("dry creek bed") undercut subtlety; ending's thematic parallels between keys/melodies and relationships feel derivative but elegantly executed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Routine genre tropes (dimensional repair, haunted tools) persist; flowery yet hollow descriptors ("mug of bitter tea" as trust symbol) feel formulaic; emotional stakes are stated rather than embodied; metaphors recycle "haunted" and "broken" without innovation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.8</question><comment>Elements included but unevenly integrated (radical change mostly backdrop, monk's cynicism inconsistently rendered); prose demonstrates control but defaults to familiar fantasy diction; premise has potential that story only partially realizes.</comment>
