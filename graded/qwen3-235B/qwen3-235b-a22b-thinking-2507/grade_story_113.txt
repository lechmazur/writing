<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks depth; the interplay between hesitancy and bold action is underdeveloped. Emotional nuance feels sketched rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot has structural coherence but feels compressed; the transition from entering the machine to resolving the knot lacks tension management. Timeframe feels underutilized narratively.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative yet unevenâ€”xenon lighting and flood trauma create mood, but the "tapestry" metaphor becomes repetitive rather than organically developed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric craft and resonant imagery elevate the storytelling, though emotional beats occasionally verge on the abstract rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Originality in combining grief and dreaming, but "fragile tapestry" and "dream-hopping machines" border on overused literary metaphors and portal fantasy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</question><comment>Elements are serviceable but unevenly integrated; the plush and sorrow-tapestry stand out, while setting and timeframe feel decorative rather than structural.</comment>
