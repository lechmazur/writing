<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's motivation (mending paternal regret through art) is clear but emotional nuances feel filtered through abstraction. Actions align with traits but lack visceral, humanizing contradictions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a redemptive arc but compresses transformation abruptly. Frost epiphany lacks intermediate steps; resolution feels rushed despite tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is lush and evocative, with humidity, mist, and frost creating tangible ephemerality. Atmosphere occasionally overwhelms narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Metaphors (frost as transient art, decay into rebirth) are elegant. Theme of redemptive impermanence resonates, but emotional beats sometimes stated rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but some phrases ("crystalline branches") lean on romanticized imagery. Frost-to-firework logic shows originality but tonal consistency wavers.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elements integrate thematically but unevenly. Frost and leaves carry symbolic weight; library setting risks feeling like a fantastical device rather than organic environment.</comment>
