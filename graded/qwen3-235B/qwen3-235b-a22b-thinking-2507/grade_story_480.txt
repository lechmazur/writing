<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Leo’s profession as a "social media exorcist" feels conceptually sharp but underexplored; his motivation (craving unfiltered reality) drives the plot but lacks interiority or emotional stakes to deepen his character beyond metaphor.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elegant circularity (music hall to mess hall to dawn) exists, but the plot’s focus on atmosphere over action creates a static rhythm; too much emphasis on "reignition" as abstract ideal rather than resolved or unresolved tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Derelict spaces are rendered viscerally through tactile decay: plaster dust, flickering bulbs, bitter tea. Sensory details (receipts "fluttering like prayer flags") tie setting to theme with atmospheric precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (receipts as relics, violin notes as "heartbeats") resonate without overstatement. The ending distills the theme (exorcism as redirection, not erasure) with quiet poetic force, avoiding didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids clichés in tone and premise but occasionally leans on lyrical abstraction ("tangible breathing warmth") instead of emotional complexity. The "quietly loud" motif is evocative but uneven in execution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements (receipt, mess hall, "familiar strangers") coalesce around a singular thematic nucleus. While the brevity emphasizes mood over arc, the lingering impression of "raw edge" persistence justifies the structure.</comment>
