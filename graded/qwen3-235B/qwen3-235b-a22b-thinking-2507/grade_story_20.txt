<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>While the archer's internal conflict is poignant, motivations shift abruptly from passive reflection to decisive action without sufficient emotional buildup; the comb and bridge symbolism feels over-explained rather than organically felt</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Non-linear reflections create thematic cohesion around regret, but the pivotal moment of decision feels slightly rushed; cause-effect between celestial imagery and character change remains vague despite strong arc</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inverted waterfall offers striking visual metaphor, but underutilizes sensory details beyond sight; celestial timeliness creates mood but lacks physicality; setting becomes metaphor-heavy backdrop rather than lived space</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor-layered prose effectively externalizes internal turmoil through water imagery and objects; ending lacks visceral impact despite emotional crescendo; theme of cowardice vs courage resonates through potent symbolic interplay</comment>
