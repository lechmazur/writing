<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character lacks psychological depth; actions illustrate thematic purpose but insufficient visceral emotion or internal conflict to justify "glamorous" persona beyond surface-level description.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Plot exists as static ritual rather than progression; temporal dissonance between historical references and futuristic setting creates structural whiplash; thematic throughline outweighs narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Vivid sensory contrasts between clinical servers and organic ochre pigments create magnetic tension; underdevelops digital-physical duality in favor of poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors ("digital whispers as holy relics") resonate intellectually but emotional impact diluted by overreliance on lyrical fatalism rather than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by precious phrasing ("fruitlessly patient") and repetitive "myth of ordinariness" refrain; ancestral ghost motif feels derivative despite inventive context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Idea-density compensates for limited narrative stakes; atmosphere transcends structural looseness but fails to justify extreme stylistic flourishes as essential rather than ornamental.</comment>
