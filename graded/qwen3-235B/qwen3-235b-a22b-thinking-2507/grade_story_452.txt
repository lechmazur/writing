<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks emotional nuance; softheartedness is stated rather than shown through distinct actions or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot is a single, resonant image (the flickering star) but lacks dynamic progression; cohesion between beginning and end is strong despite minimal arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive contrasts (chrome vs. organic, silence vs. whispers of hope) create a haunting atmosphere; sensory details are vivid and thematic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (constellations as storytelling, the belt as compass) are fresh and layered; ending resonates thematically with paradoxical quiet urgency.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Some phrases flirt with cliché ("fractured soul"), but tone and imagery avoid formulaic patterns; emotional subtext is subtly shown rather than told.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>All elements are purposeful, cohesively layered into theme; brevity enhances focus; ending invites reflection on narrative’s power to resist erasure.</comment>
