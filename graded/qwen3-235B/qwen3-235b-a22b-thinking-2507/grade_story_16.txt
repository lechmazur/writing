<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lack of cohesion between freelance career variety and problem-solving; Hemlock’s confession feels emotionally convenient rather than organically earned through prior characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear narrative arc with satisfying mechanical resolution; pacing stumbles slightly during abrupt emotional transition in Hemlock’s confession, feeling slightly compressed for word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich steampunk imagery (brass gears, soot, steam) creates immersive atmosphere; underutilizes broader worldbuilding implications of airship society or cliffside history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Poignant use of recurring wave motif and symbolic amber light; dialogue revelation feels melodramatic in contrast to otherwise restrained emotional texture in descriptions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Generative AI fingerprints visible in overly ornate similes (“scattered notes finding unity”), repetitive “rhythm” descriptions, and mechanical emotional escalation lacking psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Integrates most elements cohesively but prioritizes poetic resonance over narrative depth; the amber’s thematic weight nearly saves structural predictability in Hemlock’s redemption reveal.</grade>
