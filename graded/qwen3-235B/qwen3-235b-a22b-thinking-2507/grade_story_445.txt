<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character voice lacks distinctness despite introspective moments; motivation to conquer intangible limits drives arc but internal shifts feel slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot pivots on symbolic objects work cohesively, but tight word count strains early setup of Kael’s arrogance; arc remains intact despite pacing unevenness in revelation sequence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting details like mossy root concealment and cracked mirrors evoke decay, but sensory immersion thin in critical emotional beats; atmosphere complements spiritual-material duality theme effectively.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (broken iron as shattered pride, barbells as "vessels") deliver layered meaning; thematic unity of humility vs. hubris lingers, though emotional impact softened by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Style occasionally lapses into rhythmic repetition ("spiritually material," "fantasy practicality") that risks didacticism; subtext remains strong despite sporadic purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Cohesive metaphor network elevates the piece, but contrivance in element placement (disguise room's relevance, precise timing of friend’s entrance) undercuts organic resonance within strict word limits.</comment>
