<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character motivations are tightly woven but inner conflict lacks visceral depth; the voice is poetic yet occasionally abstract, diluting emotional immediacy. Reactions to the perfume bottle and cosmic verse imply psychological complexity, but the word limit constrains full dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structures a clear arc, but pacing fluctuates between lush description and abrupt emotional shifts, creating friction in momentum within the tight word count. Connections between beginning and end feel earned, though some transitions (ambush of memory) strain subtlety.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere thrives: sensory details (ivy-choked streets, lily-of-the-valley) are visceral and thematically resonant. Setting mirrors repressed creativity, enhancing mood. Slight over-reliance on "overgrown" metaphors barely undercuts originality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Evocative lyricism and metaphors (cosmic verse as skin-ink) elevate impact, but themes of artistic paralysis teeter on familiar ground. The ending’s symbolic weight is undercut by a tendency toward thematic stating (e.g., “knowing naivety” conclusion).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Originality shines in the cosmic verse concept and perfume symbolism, but certain passages (e.g., “silence amplify[ing] heartbeats”) lean on familiar poetic beats. Style occasionally veers into florid excess, bordering on purple prose without fully succumbing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong, but the story prioritizes mood over narrative urgency. The brevity enhances introspection but leaves thematic and emotional implications under-scavenged. Lingering questions (on legacy, fear) lack the punch of deeper excavation.</comment>
