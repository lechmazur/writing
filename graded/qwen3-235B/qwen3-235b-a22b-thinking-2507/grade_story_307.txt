<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “quiet rebellion” is consistent but underexplored; her motivations are clear but lack psychological depth, relying on poetic description over emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plot follows a tight cause-effect chain (DVD → neon messages → resistance), but the 500-word limit truncates the old guard’s reaction, making their defeat feel abrupt.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Ethereal grit is masterfully rendered through tactile decay (“boarded-up storefronts like cold fog”) and neon-soaked hope; the setting is immersive and thematically resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical metaphors (“neon tubes long dead”) and layered themes (hope vs. decay) create emotional resonance; the ending is poetic yet purposeful, though affirmations risk sentimentality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scratched DVD and neon signs avoid cliché, but the “spirited guardian” archetype slightly edges toward formulaic rebellion; minimal AI-like repetition, though some descriptive flourishes border on ornate.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole, but the fairy light shop’s symbolic link to the broader city feels underdeveloped; the ending lingers but sidesteps deeper ambiguity.</comment>
