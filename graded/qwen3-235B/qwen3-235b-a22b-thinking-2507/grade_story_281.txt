<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character development is clear but slightly rushed; transformation feels earned yet underexplored emotionally. The baffled thief's reaction to the dummy effectively reveals insecurity but the shift from poise to vulnerability lacks nuanced psychological layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is purposeful but strained by brevity; the dummy’s dialogue-heavy catalytic role feels contrived at times. The central action (sustaining focus) drives the arc but transitions between tension and resolution could be smoother within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid (salt-stained machinery, oppressive shadows) but the lighthouse’s haunting feels undercontextualized—how does its history shape the dummy? Sensory details anchor the eerie mood but connections to broader themes remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Storytelling employs strong metaphor (poetry as transformation) and emotional progression. The dummy’s dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism, however, and the theme of artistic self-redefinition could be more subtly implied rather than explicitly stated.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Originality exists in pairing a cynical thief with surreal elements, but some phrases (“salt-stung air,” “steel bones hum”) border on cliché. The poetic resolution avoids predictability but the dummy’s archetypal creepiness risks genre convention adherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements generally cohere into a thematic whole, though lighthouse’s haunting and “scorching poise” lack deep integration. The brevity feels intentional but certain elements (e.g., the empty pocket’s significance) don’t fully resonate within the constraints.</comment>
