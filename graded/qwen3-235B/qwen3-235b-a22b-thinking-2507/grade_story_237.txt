<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's psychic ability as a genealogist is uniquely tied to her sister's disappearance, but her motivations feel thinly contextualized beyond grief; her "proud humility" is asserted but underdemonstrated through action or voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cosmic fade and diary entries effectively drive the plot, with the sister's reveal as a pivotal moment. However, the pirates' threat feels secondary to the emotional resolution, leaving some narrative threads unresolved within the word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brig's atmosphere (ozone, silence) contrasts with cosmic decay, creating evocative tension. However, broader worldbuilding details like the Kuiper Belt trains feel hastily conceived rather than deeply integrated into the setting's logic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The metaphor of the chipped die mirroring human lineage is poignant, and the sister's fate-as-starlight shift avoids cloying sentimentality. The understated emotional resolution elevates the story's thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery like "stars winked out like tired eyes" works well, but some phrases ("alarm bells of heartbreak") verge on clich√©. The existential mystery feels human in voice but occasionally strained by overcompressed metaphors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tight integration of cosmic decay, puzzle-solving, and familial loss suggests purposeful brevity. However, the pirates' subplot and Elara's imprisonment lack sufficient contextualization to feel fully cohesive rather than plot-convenient.</comment>
