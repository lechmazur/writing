<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mei's motivation to restore lost traditions is clear, but her internal conflict lacks depth; interactions with the chipped tile show determination but could reveal more psychological complexity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most AI pitfalls with precise details (e.g., "forgotten stars" eyes), but some phrases ("earnest whimsy") risk preciousness; emotional nuance exists but occasionally lapses into poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cohesive thematic unity between "reclaiming the future" and fractured/whimsical imagery; brevity enhances the mystical realism rather than limiting it; lingers in mind as open-ended allegory.</comment>
