<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara’s ambivalence and "happily sad" tone are present but remain abstract psychological states rather than being dramatized through specific actions or decisions. Her motivation to scramble the "cosmic scoreboard" feels intellectually coherent but lacks psychological grounding in concrete experiences or conflicts.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The plotty logic of aligning puzzle edges with marbles to defragment reality is intriguingly cryptic but risks incoherence. The fragmented structure mirrors the theme yet lacks narrative stakes or consequences beyond the abstract resolution. Pacing prioritizes poetic rhythm over clarity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lunar colony’s sterile, humming atmosphere and tactile details (marble fractures, puzzle edges) create a vivid, melancholic alienation. The setting’s clinical precision contrasts beautifully with Elara’s abstract rebellion, though the “between heartbeats” timeframe feels more conceptual than immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The story’s lyrical metaphors (fractured marbles as broken conduits, the cosmic scoreboard) and juxtaposition of the mundane (rummage-sale cardboard) with the cosmic create profound, haunting resonance. The ending’s quiet triumph lingers as a meditation on small-scale rebellion against meaninglessness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prose avoids clichés through idiosyncratic imagery (e.g., “defragmenting spacetime”) but occasionally drifts into vague abstractions (“quietly rebellious arithmetic”) that strain against overwriting. The fusion of cosmic stakes with intimate acts feels inventive but borders on obscurity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>While each element functions as symbolic furniture, the narrative cohesion feels more thematic than structural. The lunar setting and marbles are indispensable, but the “final oath” and “between heartbeats” timeframe rely heavily on poetic implication over emotional payoff.</grade>
