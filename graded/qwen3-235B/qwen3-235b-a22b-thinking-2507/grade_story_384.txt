<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's role as a cook feels underdeveloped; motivations are present but lack psychological depth. Notches as cipher reveal thematic connection, but actions often feel like plot devices rather than organic extensions of his culinary background.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arc from discovery to revelation is legible but rushed in climax. Logical cause-effect between decoding notches and machine subversion exists, but pacing falters during exposition dumps and abrupt final tremor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</comment>Atmospheric details like "centuries-thick dust" and "frayed console whispers" create potent decayed-technocracy ambiance. Timeframe implied through dust layers works, but the setting occasionally overwhelms character focus.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "erasing frantic miscalculations" effectively blend physical and conceptual themes. The ending's on-the-nose message weakens subtlety, but the interplay between food-prep tools and seismic sabotage offers compelling subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Avoids complete formulaicity through unusual object/persona combinationsâ€”e.g., cooking knives as defensive weapons. Some purple prose ("calm before final reckoning") and over-reliance on atmospheric adjectives, but generally maintains stylistic coherence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cohesion strained by tenuous element integration. The cook's profession and walking stick cipher feel contrived rather than organically connected to the seismic conspiracy. Lingering thought about humanity's hubris is potent but underserved by execution.</comment>
