<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Main character's motivation is clear but internal conflict lacks depth; Kael's actions feel inconsistent with established trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but the "interconnected wishes" resolution feels unearned; pacing in early paragraphs drags micro-prayers development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is conceptually rich but over-reliance on tech jargon replaces immersive sensory details; atmosphere loses authenticity through inconsistent scale shifts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by formulaic metaphors ("fireflies in limbo") and expository emotional states; some paragraphs exhibit AI-like pattern repetition in describing tech elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrate logically but lack symbiotic development; the "nano-city" and "remorse/forgiveness" framework enable deeper themes but feel artificially imposed rather than organically connected.</comment>
