<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's fading champion identity remains abstract, motivation to map consciousness feels concept-driven rather than emotionally grounded. Underdeveloped personality beyond poetic gestures and existential musings.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Abstract progression exists through folding origami, but lacks traditional arc. Pacing fits surreal tone but sacrifices narrative momentum. Coherence maintained through tone rather than plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is immersive and evocative, with vivid descriptions of the island's ethereal qualities. Sensory details (corn husk scent, swan's warmth) work well, but setting remains overly cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor (origami as consciousness mapping) and haunting imagery (fathomless gaze as collective consciousness). Ending provides thematic closure through "cartographer of the soul" transformation. Some abstract passages lose emotional traction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original concept execution but occasionally descends into pretentiousness ("luminous pathways of thought"). Some generic descriptors ("disturbing comfort") undercut deeper insights. Unique metaphors counterbalance over-ornate passages.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cohesively blends surreal existential themes, though integration of assigned elements feels deliberate rather than organic. Style occasionally prioritizes poetic density over clarity, but creates lingering metaphysical questions about memory and identity.</comment>
