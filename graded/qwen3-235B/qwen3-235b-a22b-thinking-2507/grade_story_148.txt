<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Past as storm chaser adds texture but underexplored; motivation for restoration lacks emotional root while tying logically to his desert patience. Actions align with traits, but personality depth remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear progression from tension to resolution, but transitions between tapestry decryption and carousel mechanics feel condensed; pacing uneven in balancing introspection and action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Alpine cold vs. desert heat richly juxtaposed; sensory details (e.g., rust, wool, twilight) immersive without overwriting; setting is a character itself.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads as blueprints, storms as lessons) elevate theme of healing through creation; emotional payoff restrained but meaningful; subtext about salvaging forgotten artistry lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>No formulaic tropes; tapestry mechanics and desert parallels feel fresh; prose occasionally leans on adjectives ("celestial dancers") but avoids overembellishment; emotional nuance shows through action, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements work but not all resonate equally; some—like timeframe—feel tacked on rather than foundational; theme of mending through craftsmanship carries weight, if unevenly.</comment>
