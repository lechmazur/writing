<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot hinges on poetic symbolism rather than concrete cause-effect logic; circular structure effective but lacks tension and narrative urgency typical of publishable literary work.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details and haunting imagery create strong atmosphere, but deeper integration between setting symbolism and character transformation feels underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Bewitching prose carries the story, but emotional resonance remains more implied than visceral; thematic clarity and elegant metaphors elevate it above average work.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes but occasionally substitutes poetic abstraction for concrete emotional specificity; language occasionally veers toward ornamental density without sufficient narrative payoff.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually but lack the narrative heft and emotional depth demanded by elite literary standards; succeeds more as atmospheric vignette than complete story.</comment>
