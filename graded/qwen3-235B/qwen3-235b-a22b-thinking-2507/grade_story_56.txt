<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strengths: Silas's guilt and deception are clearly tied to his motivation, but the "invisibles" as victims add psychological depth. Weakness: Elara's immediate, almost passive acceptance feels undermotivated; her sorrow lacks the nuanced backstory that might make her reaction resonate beyond plot convenience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strength: Confession-reveal structure works within constraints with the computer reboot as deus ex machina. Weakness: Pacing stumbles between the "magnetize" gesture and the archive reveal; the emotional climax risks feeling rushed as the story tries to service both Silas's internal and external conflicts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength: Lush, sensorially immersive decay (cracked concrete/apple trees, metallic hums, magnetic gestures) creates a tactile, haunting atmosphere. Weakness: The skyscraper-farmland juxtaposition feels conceptually rich but underexploitedâ€”few connections made between vertical architecture and agricultural labor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strength: The ledger as metaphor for collective delusion and the blank tag as erased human value create powerful symbolism. Weakness: Ending tension between truth-as-liberation vs. truth-as-destruction feels slightly unbalanced; emotional payoff relies too heavily on reader inference.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strength: Avoids genre tropes with its unromanticized guilt and bureaucratic ruin framework. Weakness: "Energetically lethargic" description verges on oxymoronic abstraction; computer restart coincidence strains credibility more than it should.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Strength: Tight integration of elements creates thematic cohesion around truth/fabrication duality. Weakness: Some conceits (voices = victims, magnetic "proof") occasionally become didactic rather than organically symbolic; pacing near conclusion feels compressed.</comment>
