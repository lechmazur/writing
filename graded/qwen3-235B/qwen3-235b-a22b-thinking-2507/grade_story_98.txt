<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character's external traits align with assigned elements, but inner conflicts lack nuanced expression; growth feels abrupt rather than earned through layered internal/external tension.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot arc is conceptually clear but relies on symbolic shorthand rather than organic progression; pivotal moments (ruler breaking) feel staged rather than inevitable.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setting blends mundane and esoteric elements effectively, but atmospheric depth is undercut by over-reliance on familiar tropes (secret societies, oppressive silence) without subversion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Skilled metaphorical layering (ruler vs. tapestry) and thematic coherence elevate the narrative, though emotional resonance is occasionally diluted by abstract phrasing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s through symbolic inversion (secrets as warnings), but stylistic flourishes occasionally overbalance subtlety; some descriptors border on ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere narratively but unevenly contribute to thematic weight; the tapestry and ruler are masterful, while dog walking's symbolic purpose remains underexplored.</comment>
