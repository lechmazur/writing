<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Character voice is distinct and thematically resonant, but emotional depth falters at key moments—motivation feels overdetermined rather than organically revealed through action.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot momentum relies too heavily on thematic abstraction; pivotal transitions (mirror clarity, ascension) lack concrete cause-effect logic within the tight structure, creating conceptual gaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptionally visceral worldbuilding—sensory details like ozone and "burnt thread" fuse aesthetic and emotional tension, though steampunk elements occasionally lean on genre shorthand rather than innovation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (threads, mirrors) and resonant ending elevate the work, though some phrasing ("fragile as spun moonlight") risks overfamiliarity despite its effectiveness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality shines in concept-layering but stumbles in cadences—certain phrases ("whispered reassurances") edge toward formulaic elegance rather than idiosyncratic voice.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole with lingering philosophical resonance, though the brevity occasionally sacrifices narrative precision for poetic compression.</comment>
