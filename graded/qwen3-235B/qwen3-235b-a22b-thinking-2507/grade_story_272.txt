<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara's socially awkward demeanor is present but underdeveloped; her motivation (regret-driven invention) is clear but lacks layered emotional complexity. Her actions (late-night decryption attempts) align with her traits, but her voice remains derivative rather than distinctive.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The plot follows a clear arc (failed attempts → breakthrough → acceptance), but the encrypted method's mechanics are overly abstracted. The ending feels abrupt, and the tight word limit strains the balance between technical exposition and emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The diner's sensory details (cracked vinyl, fluorescent hum) create grittiness, but the archive-as-digital-graveyard metaphor leans too heavily on clichéd "tech-archaeology" tropes. Atmosphere complements isolation but underutilizes the timeframe's potential for introspective pacing.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Powerful metaphors (tree of regret, whistle as "key") deepen thematic resonance. While the ending avoids pat resolution, the reliance on explicitly stated emotions ("weight of abandoned connections") occasionally prioritizes telling over showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery and structure are vivid but occasionally lapse into formulaic phrasing ("humming like a faulty generator"). The acoustic ciphering concept feels original yet strains credibility. Character reasoning occasionally favors poetic abstraction over human logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly. The whistle and archive are well-integrated, but the diner setting and "reversed sonic trails" feel utilitarian rather than transformative. Leaves a lingering idea about legacy, but narrative tension falters under density of concepts.</comment>
