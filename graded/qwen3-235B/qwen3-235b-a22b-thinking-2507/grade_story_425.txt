<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character's melancholy and purpose are present but remain surface-level. Motivation is clear but lacks deep emotional grounding that would make his centuries-long vigil truly compelling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Limited word count strains structural clarity—reboot sequence feels abrupt despite effective cause-and-effect setup. The needle's intervention lacks intermediate tension to sustain the high-stakes restoration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Masterful integration of sensory details: polished marble, fractured console textures, and the humming electronics create an immersive cathedral of science. Sensory immersion elevates the setting beyond genre conventions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich symbolic subtext (degradation vs. renewal) and precise metaphors ("knuckles white on the needle") convey emotional states without exposition. The final smile resonates as earned catharsis rather than sentimentality.</comment>

Avoids mechanical exposition; even "bored excitement" is rendered through physicality (restless energy). The blackout's aftermath avoids dystopian tropes through poetic pragmatism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Achieves remarkable cohesion—each element serves existential themes. The 500-word constraint enhances the mythic brevity, though the stranger remains underutilized as a narrative catalyst.</comment>
