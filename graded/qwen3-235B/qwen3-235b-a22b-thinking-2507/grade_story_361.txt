<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent with actions, but lacks deeper emotional nuance beyond determination. His mechanical intuition and use of the dice as a cultural artifact reveal some complexity, but "trapper" identity remains underdeveloped as action driver.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Effective beginning/middle/end structure within the constraint, but momentum relies heavily on atmospheric tension rather than active plot progression. Coherence holds despite brevity, though the connection between emulating patterns and preventing cultural erasure remains under-explained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exceptional sensory immersion through steam, chalk dust, brass gears. Retro-futurism contrasts poignantly with indigenous knowledge preservation. Timeframe of impending change permeates the setting, but the diner/schoolhouse dual setting shift could be more logically connected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (hearth as cultural memory, dice as ancestral logic) and evocative imagery. Subtext about technology vs tradition resonates. Ending lacks emotional climax resolution, and the central conflict remains passive. Writing style is purposeful but occasionally self-conscious.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original fusion of steampunk and cultural preservation themes stands out. Avoids heavy clich√©s but leans on "doom of progress" trope without sufficient subversion. Metaphors like "machinery of old stories" are fresh. Emotional showing dominates, but some overwritten descriptions (e.g., "last vessel of unbroken knowledge") strain authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a thematically unified whole despite crowded concept list. Style occasionally hinders clarity with poetic excess, but the length feels intentional. Subtext about knowledge preservation lingers. Some elements (trapper, guardian) could better serve the narrative spine.</comment>
