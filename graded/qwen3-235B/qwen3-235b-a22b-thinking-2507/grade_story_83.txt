<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivation is conceptually clear but underdeveloped; the protagonist's shift from skepticism to revolutionary hope lacks emotional nuance. Lena's "suspiciously trusting" nature feels abrupt rather than strategically layered, and dialogue doesn't fully differentiate voices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Plot structure is logically sound but constrained by the word limit; the revelation about the Stag's true nature arrives suddenly. While the burn-pattern discovery drives action, the final resolution prioritizes thematic resonance over narrative closure, creating a sense of abstraction rather than cohesion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mirror-filled lab creates a vivid, disorienting atmosphere enhanced by specific details (fractured reflections, dusty light). However, leaf raking as a cover isn't meaningfully integrated—its seasonal mundanity doesn't deepen the lab's thematic exploration of distorted reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (hope as energy, broken mirrors as possibilities) effectively enrich themes, and the ending's symbolic weight lingers. However, emotional beats (Aris's courage, Lena's trust) are often stated rather than embodied through subtext or action, weakening impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The story subverts the "cryptid hunt" trope by making the Stag non-corporeal, and the "whispering" concept is freshly tied to scientific failure. However, phrases like "thousand possibilities" lean into overused mirror symbolism, and Lena's exposition-heavy dialogue risks feeling didactic rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion—especially the reframing of hope as "resonance"—anchors the narrative, but integration of elements like the plastic tray and leaf raking timeframe feels occasionally schematic. The story aims for lyrical depth but occasionally defaults to thematic shorthand.</comment>
