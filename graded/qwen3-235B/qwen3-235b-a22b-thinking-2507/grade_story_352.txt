<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character traits and motivation are clear but lack nuanced inner conflict or complexity. Actions align with traits but remain archetypal without deeper emotional or psychological depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot flows logically within constraints but has abrupt transitions (e.g., sudden escape) and underdeveloped cause-effect relationships (leaf sound timing). Pacing uneven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is richly textured with sensory details, but the invisible ink factory's mechanics strain credibility. The setting enhances mood but lacks logical cohesion for the fantasy elements.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors and thematic resonance (music as living art) create strong impact. Emotional stakes are implied rather than shown, and the ending feels thematically purposeful but under-earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Avoids most tropes with inventive concepts (resonant bone, ink erasing music) but occasionally relies on poetic vagueness over concrete logic. Language balances lyricism and clarity but risks pretension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive whole but strain logic (leaf as timing mechanism). Thematic unity is strong despite some forced metaphors. Leaves lingering impression but lacks transcendent depth.</comment>
