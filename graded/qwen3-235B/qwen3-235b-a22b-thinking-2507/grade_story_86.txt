<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc with logical progression; the candle's intervention and resolution are coherent despite brevity, with cause-effect well-maintained within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere skillfully blends high-tech and mystical elements, though some sensory details (e.g., candle’s effects) could be more visceral to deepen immersion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong use of metaphor and theme (e.g., candle as truth/comparison to borrowed dawn) elevates impact; ending resonates emotionally and conceptually.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids cloying clichés by combining cyberpunk and mystical motifs innovatively. Emotions shown through action (e.g., steadying hands), not stated. Only minor moments edge toward poetic overindulgence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Each element serves the narrative without redundancy. The story transcends its brief length by intertwining theme, action, and symbol into a cohesive meditation on truth’s fragility.</comment>
