<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot has clear structure but relies on contrived scavenger hunt framing; pacing is efficient yet occasionally rushed in emotional transitions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Language balances lyricism with clarity, but phrases like “uncharted sea of understanding” border on familiar abstraction; emotional shifts occasionally “tell” rather than “show.”</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Element integration is partially cohesive, though scavenger hunt and thunder/lightning framework feel imposed; core theme of internalized courage lingers thoughtfully.</comment>
