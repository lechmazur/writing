<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characterization is conceptually clear but lacks depth; motivations drive plot efficiently but inner conflict or complexity is underdeveloped. The "moral code" is principled but feels doctrinaire rather than humanly nuanced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a tight arc but relies on contrivance—e.g., bottle caps' metallurgic specificity strains logic. Pacing is mostly controlled, though transitions between action beats feel slightly rushed despite structural cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Vivid setting through tactile contrasts (ancient Rome vs. digital grit) and sensory details like "pixelated sand," but tonal dissonance between imperial erasure and virtual aesthetic risks diluting historical gravity with cyberpunk whimsy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong thematic resonance around memory and ethics, enhanced by metaphors (e.g., bottle caps as "relics"). Ending avoids sentimentality but leans on poetic vagueness; tension between "showing" and "telling" is unevenly balanced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept (cyber-archaeology), but phrasing occasionally veers into ornate abstraction ("crisp anachronistic code," "confident uncertainty") that feels self-consciously "literary" rather than organic. Characters are archetypal but not hollow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ambition to interrogate historical erasure is evident, with elements purposefully woven into a coherent whole. The brevity sharpens focus but leaves subtext underdeveloped; lingering questions about Valerius’s fate or the system’s power feel intentional rather than incomplete.</comment>
