<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is vividly tied to their conflict with the reflection, but lacks emotional depth beyond the abstract drive for authenticity; actions are conceptually coherent but psychologically underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc of creation vs. imitation, but the compressed structure leaves pivotal moments (e.g., the reflection's smile) feeling abrupt and under-earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is visceral and original: "quantum foam," ozone-salt synesthesia, and collapsing wave functions immerse readers in a setting that thematically mirrors the protagonist's existential struggle.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and existential themes provoke reflection on impermanence vs. authenticity, but emotional resonance relies heavily on metaphor rather than earned character investment; the ending resonates conceptually but feels slightly preordained.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Echoes of literary fiction tropes ("beautiful decay") flirt with pretension; the quantum beach avoids clich√© but some phrases ("corroded rapture") border on self-indulgent. Unusual structure suggests human creativity, though the rhythm occasionally feels rehearsed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Cohesion is strong among assigned elements, but the narrative prioritizes mood over narrative urgency; the ending feels thematically complete yet risks reading as a polished abstraction rather than an earned conclusion.</comment>
