<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's "jumpy" trait drives physical reactions but lacks depth beyond nervousness; motivation to unmask Lumina is clear but inadequately rooted in personal history; actions align with assigned "typically bizarre" method but don't reveal unique necromantic voice; first-person narration might've strengthened voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protest mural analysis cleverly drives plot forward; cause-effect between fishhook's glow and revelation logic holds; pacing feels compressed but complete within constraints; some transitions between introspection and action could be smoother; ending tremors adequately resolve tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Retro game world exquisitely textured with pixelated cobblestones, static-laced shadows, and simulated moonlight; oppressive silence contrasts with humming mural; old gods' slumber connects thematically to digital stagnation; paint viscosity details create tactile immersion; tone balances irony and existential dread.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elicits tension between truth and comfort through visceral imagery of parasitic sprite and trembling protagonist; fishhook as truth-revealer is symbolic; ending leaves thematic resonance about iconoclastic consequences; "system straining under truth" metaphor works well; minimal telling, strong showing.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; worldbuilding merges gaming nostalgia with cosmic horror; "teardrop-shaped smear" coding subverts mural trope; some phrases like "decaying digital realm" border on generality; emotional nuance in faltering resolve feels earned rather than stated; tonal consistency maintained throughout.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements cohesively serve existential cyber-noir theme; 8-bit decay logic strengthened by old gods metaphor; length constraints create urgency rather than limitation; fishhook/Lumina duality and mural decryption show inventive combination; lingering questions about system-wide consequences avoid simplistic resolution.</comment>
