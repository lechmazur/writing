<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character transformation is dramatic but lacks depth in depicting inner conflict; motivation (regaining honor) is clear but underexplored through backstory or nuanced reactions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot progression leans on symbolic gestures (singing, shackles breaking) that feel abrupt within strict word limits; connections between defiance and release lack gradual tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting's sensory details (inkstone, plum blossoms) create vivid atmosphere, but the courtyard becomes a symbolic backdrop rather than a lived-in space with organic ties to the character's history.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (spark, manacles) are effective but occasionally overstated; emotional impact is undercut by the protagonist’s sudden, undercontextualized redemption.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Risks predictable "wise mentor" tropes; avoids cliché through evocative imagery (tapestry, lotus dew) but stumbles with overly stylized phrasing ("terrifyingly vast potential").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements are tightly integrated with theme, but the narrative’s brevity prioritizes symbolism over narrative realism; leaves a lingering emotional resonance that elevates the overall impact.</comment>
