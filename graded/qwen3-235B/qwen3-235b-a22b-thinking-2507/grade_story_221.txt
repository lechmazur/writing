<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's dual identity as a ghost whisperer and her fractured relationship with her mother inform her internal conflict, but her voice occasionally flattens into generic melancholy rather than revealing idiosyncratic depth or nuanced evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>While the amber as catalyst drives the central action, minor structural hiccups arise—early references to drowned sailors aren't meaningfully resolved, and the letter framing device feels strained by the story's tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The carnival's decay is rendered through specific, haunting texture—mildew, rust, broken targets—but the temporal layering of past/future and the half-written letter framework only partially cohere into a unified atmospheric whole.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (frozen insect = frozen heart; thawing = connection) elevate the narrative beyond genre conventions, with Finn's ephemeral reappearance delivering emotional resonance through understated physicality (shy smile, dissolving form).</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Generally avoids clichéd ghost tropes through specific sensory anchoring (calliope music vs. generic spookiness) but slips into overwrought phrasing ("wave of pure...nostalgia") at vulnerable moments.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements like the amber and family tradition feel organically entangled with Elara's arc, though the Mary Celeste reference and shooting gallery's mechanical details function more as window dressing than narrative engine.</comment>
