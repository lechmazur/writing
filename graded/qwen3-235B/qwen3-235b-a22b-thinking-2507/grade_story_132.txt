<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s character is shaped through her defiance and connection to the ticket stub, but her motivations—while clear—lack layered internal conflict, reducing emotional depth despite consistent links to her traits</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot’s tight structure—Elara’s flight, revelation in the cabin, and confrontation—navigates the word limit skillfully, though the villagers’ abrupt laughter feels underdeveloped</comment>
