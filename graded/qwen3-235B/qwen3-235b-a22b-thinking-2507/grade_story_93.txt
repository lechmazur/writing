<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's desperation drives the plot effectively, but lacks depth beyond their role in the crisis; emotional stakes of their relationships remain underexplored despite the unresolved farewell.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical and driven by clear actions, but some resolutions (e.g., sudden clarity from Anya's voice) feel rushed within the tight word count, weakening their emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Immersive sensory details and a decayed, high-concept setting create a vivid atmosphere; the blend of archaic and technological elements enhances the dystopian mood.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective use of metaphor (e.g., Fibonacci patterns as symbolic of overlooked truths) enriches the narrative; the ending resolves the immediate crisis but leaves the broader theme of human/nature bonds underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Original premise and integration of archaic/scientific motifs stand out, but the prose occasionally veers into overwrought descriptions and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Coherence is maintained despite high-concept density, but the brevity leaves some elements (e.g., Anyaâ€™s role, pirate radio mechanics) feeling contrived or underexplored.</comment>
