<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but lacks concrete emotional depth. Motivation is clear yet abstract, with actions aligning thematically but not viscerally. Voice is lyrical but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot has internal cohesion and thematic closure but lacks traditional conflict/resolution. Pacing works for its vignette structure but feels structurally slight despite poetic resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harsh, vivid sensory details (acid rain, skeletal oaks) masterfully create atmosphere that mirrors character introspection. Setting is integral to both mood and thematic exploration of decay/renewal.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (embers, puzzle pieces) and symbolic imagery create lasting impact. Subtext about choice vs. legacy resonates, though emotional beats occasionally feel abstract rather than experiential.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes with original metaphors, but some phrases risk lushness over clarity ("prickly wonder"). Emotional complexity emerges through metaphor rather than nuanced character psychology.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><comment>Lyrical cohesion among elements creates an evocative miniature, though the "why" behind several key choices (emotional, symbolic) feels more assembled than organically felt. Leaves thematic residue but not fully realized resonance.</comment>
