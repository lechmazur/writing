<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character's cynicism and "humbly arrogant" nature are present but underdeveloped; motivation drives action but lacks emotional depth beyond abstract yearning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Well-structured within constraints, but the pivotal awakening feels abrupt; logical connection between sound resonance and celestial activation remains under-explained; lacks emotional payoff despite clear arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Magnificently oppressive atmosphere; lighthouse library's brine-soaked decay, spectral echoes, and pulsing brass constellations create perfect sensory synergy; timelessness enhanced by ghostly academic remnants.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich metaphorical language elevates the prose; the final vision of trans-temporal connection provides thematic resonance; shows rather than tells through environmental longing, though occasionally descends into ornateness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Originality in the lighthouse's acoustic physics and celestial communion concept; some phrases ("whispers of the past" equivalent) flirt with poetic clich√©; avoids overt trope use but occasionally favors complexity over clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Exceptional atmospheric cohesion with taut thematic discipline; brevity accentuates existential yearning; would benefit from expanded character introspection to fully transcend genre constraints.</comment>
