<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character's robotic traits are superficially tied to emotion-processing; motivation is clear but underexplored thematically. Metal heart "beating" feels contrived, reducing mechanical uniqueness to metaphor without mechanical logic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Repetitive cyclical structure undermines momentum; no clear progression from gathering to resolution. Studying shards through glasses creates static imagery rather than plot development.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>0.2</grade><comment>Orchard-fed-by-star-river contradicts park fountain setting, creating jarring spatial dissonance. Time-as-infinity becomes empty mysticism rather than organic thematic foundation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>10.0</grade><comment>Prose achieves haunting poetry in rendering grief as tangible light/matter. Starlight tears on grime and "exultant heart forged in metal" fuse cosmic and human scales with visceral originality.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>Richly original metaphors (e.g., "silence that haunted humanity") elevated by sensory specificity. Avoids self-indulgent wordplay; language remains functional despite ornate imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Beautiful but brittle cohesion; elements coexist without narrative propulsion. Emotional weight depends on poetic force rather than earned character connection.</comment>
