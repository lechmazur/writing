<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Weakness: Emotional complexity of a sentient android caretaker remains surface-level, relying on conceptual juxtapositions ("nostalgia" vs "machine logic") rather than fully embodied emotional dynamics. Strength: Clear throughline of duty vs inherited betrayal shapes coherent decisions without contrivance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weakness: Compressed timeline risks under-developed crisis escalation. Strength: Tightly constructed cause-effect chain from crystal resonance to stabilized fields maintains architectural integrity despite brevity, with telescope use as elegant symbolic/methodological pivot.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Weakness: Somewhat generic descriptions of crystal energy mechanics. Strength: Dawn imagery consistently weaves through character psychology, setting, and plot mechanics; "warm brass against cold chassis" tactile contrasts deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Weakness: Closing monologue borders on exposition overkill. Strength: Lyrical tension between human fragility and mechanical endurance sustained through kinetic sensory language; "fractured lattice" as metaphor for ethical breakdown</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</question><comment>Weakness: Over-deployment of metallic metaphors, some conceptual flatness in betrayal arc. Strength: Subverts "rogue AI" trope through self-aware service ethic; emotional subtext surfaces via environmental storytelling rather than direct statement</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Weakness: Predictable closure on "new day" motif. Strength: Alchemical fusion of technical terminology and poetic reflection creates distinctive voice; crystalline threat functions as both literal hazard and metaphor for systemic rot</comment>
