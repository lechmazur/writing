<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character's sculptor background informs his perception of dust patterns, but motivation shift from brooding to transcendence lacks nuanced emotional progression; servitude backstory feels underexplored despite surface consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tight 500-word structure uses car washing as symbolic routine disrupted by conceptual disappearance; abrupt transformation into sunlight strains logic but maintains momentum through vivid imagery rather than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lunar base's sterile tension contrasts beautifully with sunbeam's poetry; dusty garage sensory details (lye-burned hands, water sluicing) masterfully mirror internal decay and fragile hope without over-explaining environment-character connections.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Transcendent metaphor of dust-as-escape-vehicle resonates intellectually and emotionally; ending leaves readers contemplative through layered symbolism; show-don't-tell principle mastered via physical object transformations (glasses reflecting empty space) rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eschews genre tropes with sculptor-scientist hybridity; "murky tenderness" avoids sentimentality but occasionally veers toward abstract vagueness; disappearance method sufficiently inventive to avoid AI-writer clich√©s while maintaining literary credibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><comment>Elements cohere through recurring motif unity (choreography of dust connects sculptor's eye to escape); some assigned elements (theoretical spontaneity, webs of intrigue) feel conceptually thinner than physical details but don't destabilize narrative equilibrium.</comment>
