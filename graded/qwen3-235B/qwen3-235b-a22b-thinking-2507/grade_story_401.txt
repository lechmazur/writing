<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt over her brother's death drives her arc, but her wilderness guide background feels underutilized; her shift from avoidance to healing through decoding the blanket is emotionally resonant but lacks nuanced exploration of her professional motivations.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Structure follows a clear emotional arc from diver's ritual to surface-level catharsis, but the tight word limit forces compressions in her transition from decoding entries to full resolution; pivotal moments (ring discovery, final messages) feel slightly rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kelp strands brushing decayed chandeliers and silt-as-regret metaphors create visceral immersion; the sunken ballroom’s contrast with surface-level coffee ritual works as a motif, though sunlight descriptions verge on overused imagery.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphor of physical/emotional equalization is strikingly original; emotional beats (guilt to healing) are "shown" through tactile interactions with objects; climax feels earned but the "laughing underwater" moment risks undercutting gravity through slight tonal dissonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Balances poetic lyricism ("pain woven into strength") with concrete diving terminology without descending into cliché; avoids over-explaining her psychology through weighted object interactions; some phrases ("manic clarity") risk abstraction without sufficient contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere around water-as-redemption metaphor; the economy of story space (submerged grief resolved through decoding) feels deliberate; lingering question about grandmother’s narrative role diminishes thematic focus.</comment>
