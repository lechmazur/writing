<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Undertaker's weariness and knowledge are clear but underexplored; motivation is coherent yet thinly contextualized; actions align with traits but lack humanizing complexity; voice is stylistically distinct but perhaps overly ornate for functional realism.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Backfire-to-crisis pacing is effective; action sequence is logically structured but slightly rushed; celestial/time mechanics require suspension of disbelief; connection between beginning/end is strong but thematic depth feels truncated by word count; cause-effect logic is mostly airtight despite supernatural premises.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Blend of ancient Persian aesthetics with modern intrusion creates striking contrasts; sensory details (turquoise tiles, electric lights) enhance but don't fully immerse; atmosphere supports spiritual stakes but lacks tactile immediacy; setting-character-object integration is conceptually bold but occasionally abstract; temperature metaphors compensate for underdeveloped spatial presence.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sustained tension via mechanical collapse is well-executed; ending's thematic payoff feels slightly glib despite poetic language; symbolism (darkness vs. light, tribal wisdom) is resonant but risks oversimplification; conflict resolution relies on precision over emotional weight; writing style elevates material but occasionally obscures psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Blends mythic and modern with originality; avoids overt clich√©s but leans on familiar "ancient technology awakens" archetypes; descriptive flourishes enhance yet occasionally verge on self-indulgence; character reasoning balances mysticism and logic but strains plausibility; metaphors (dimming stars as "absolute dark") are potent but occasionally generic; emotional stakes hinted at rather than embodied.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Assigned elements coalesce into a unified mythos; premise feels deliberately constrained despite tight structure; synthesis of tribal knowledge, celestial mechanics, and existential threat demonstrates clever scaffolding; themes resonate beyond surface plot but require significant reader inference; stylistic ambition occasionally overshadows narrative intimacy.</comment>
