<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's tension and motivation are evident but underdeveloped; internal conflict relies heavily on symbolic objects rather than nuanced emotional progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure exists but feels compressed; transitions between collecting fragments and the resolution lack layered emotional or narrative payoff within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocative (e.g., "sterile scent of regolith") but some setting elements feel decorative rather than integral to the character's journey.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (photograph, "fragments") carries the thematic weight; ending resonates emotionally and thematically despite minor pacing flaws.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but relies on elevated prose that occasionally veers into abstraction; emotional beats lean on metaphor more than visceral specificity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are well-integrated but not transformative; the story succeeds as a meditation on rebellion-as-identity but lacks a distinct stylistic signature.</comment>
