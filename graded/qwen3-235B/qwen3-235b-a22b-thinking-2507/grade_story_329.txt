<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wealth of psychological nuance in protagonist's chess-driven mindset and self-imposed isolation, though some motivations (abandoning tournaments) remain underexplored. Actions align with fractured psyche but character's transformation feels slightly rushed within short form constraints.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragmented discovery drives plot effectively, but causal logic between confetti/map fragment and final revelation lacks sufficient connective tissue. Pacing balances introspection and action, yet the resolution feels concept-heavy for the compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hydroponic farm's sterile bioluminescence contrasts beautifully with organic decay beneath. Sensory layering of ozone tang, rhythmic machinery hum, and visual contrast between controlled green glow and wild confetti creates powerful immersive tension between order and chaos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical layering of chess strategy onto environmental investigation showcases sophisticated craft. Thematic subtext about surrender vs control resonates through precise imagery, though emotional payoff feels slightly diluted by excessive thematic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original conceptual fusion of cyberpunk agriculture and psychological mystery avoids clich√©, with some phrases ("xenophobic walls") feeling slightly too neat. Emotional beats shown through environment rather than stated, though interiority occasionally veers too poetic.</comment>
