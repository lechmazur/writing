<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation (honoring Elara) feels imposed rather than revealed through actions; psychological complexity is hinted but not developed, with backstory fragments overshadowing current decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot is static; minimal forward momentum despite resonator scans; narrative arc collapses under the weight of excessive flashbacks; beginning/middle/end structure is implied rather than executed with precision.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels in sensory details (ozone, crystal refractions) but fails to fully integrate irradiated plains context; setting becomes decorative rather than shaping the character's choices.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Emotional resonance emerges through film restoration parallels and tactile memories, undercut by heavy-handed "sound of resolve" repetition; ending is poignant but lacks narrative surprise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Conceptual collisions (necromancer using tech) feel underexplored; movie nostalgia risks sentimentality; language occasionally leans on "futuristic nostalgia" vagueness rather than precise originality.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cohesion is strained by underdeveloped elements; successfully weaves melancholy and scientific purpose but relies on atmospheric weight to compensate for structural weaknesses.</comment>
