<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear but relies heavily on internal monologue over nuanced action; conflicting hearts concept is stated rather than dramatized through specific memories or interactions</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tight structure with thematic bookends, but plot momentum loses urgency in the middle paragraph's abstract musing; abrupt transition from mineral inspection to epiphany</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Assigned elements are meticulously woven into thematic scaffolding; prose quality elevates premise beyond formulaic redemption arc but shows strain under word-limit compression</comment>
