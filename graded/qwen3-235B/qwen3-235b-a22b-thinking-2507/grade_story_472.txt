<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arc is implied, but motivation for leaving regulated matchmaking lacks depth; emotional resonance of her 'lament' remains surface-level despite poetic phrasing that gestures at complexity without delivering it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot hinges on poetic causality (flag vibrations unlocking coordinates), which feels contrived despite lyrical coherence; transitions between action and introspection lack narrative tension necessary for satisfying resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sensory immersion succeeds through tactile descriptions (button's warmth, flag's movement), but the zeppelin setting feels more symbolic than functionally integrated into the decryption logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Similes like 'silent scream' and 'sharp gentleness' feel engineered rather than organic; emotional impact diluted by over-reliance on elegiac mood which occasionally veers into affectation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Phrases like 'whispers between the stars' and 'quantum static' lean on genre conventions; character's grief and purpose occasionally ring hollow through second-hand metaphor rather than visceral specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elegant language distracts from underdeveloped stakes; concept cohesion exists but strains under the weight of its own lyrical ambition without anchoring the cosmic to the personal.</comment>
