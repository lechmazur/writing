<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks psychological complexity; "fiercely nonchalant" trait shown through surface actions but not internalized depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Plot flows logically with tight cause-effect; the story's arc completes through Zephyr's actions, though the rapid resolution feels slightly compressed within word constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Steam elements create vivid atmosphere but lack narrative integration; sounds and smells ground the setting, but spatial consistency wavers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uses effective metaphors (truth as compass, manuscript as tool against chaos) and layered subtext, though tonal unity occasionally falters between poetic flourishes and plain speech.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids most clichés but relies on expected "tarnished hero" tropes; some phrases like "kiss the horizon" border on poetic abstraction, but sensory details elevate specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically—the manuscript, rumors, and steampunk setting coalesce into a cohesive whole that lingers thematically despite brevity.</comment>
