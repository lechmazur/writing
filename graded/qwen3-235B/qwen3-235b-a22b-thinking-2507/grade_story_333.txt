<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve traditions is clear and shapes her actions, but emotional depth could be richer beyond internal resolve and bitter-sweet resolution. Her voice is distinct but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction rather than organic introspection.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot follows a tight arc from discovery to stabilization, with logical cause-effect in the building’s reactions. Pacing is urgent yet allows thematic breathing. Some transitions between introspection and action could be smoother, but cohesion remains strong within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (damp stone, groaning walls, thunder) deeply immerse the reader. The haunted passage’s shifting nature enhances atmosphere, blending physical and emotional unease. Atmosphere amplifies both character motivation and themes of anxiety/neglect.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("building’s heartbeat," "braided bitterness") and layered themes (tradition vs. erasure, fear as collective trauma) elevate the narrative. Emotional resonance is strong, though the ending leans slightly on optimism without fully interrogating ambiguity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids predictable tropes by personifying the building’s fear as reactive rather than supernatural. Some abstract phrases ("sincere rebel") occasionally flirt with vagueness. Subtext about institutional neglect is fresh, but emotional beats occasionally verge on told rather than shown.</comment>
