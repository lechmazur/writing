<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s secrecy drives the plot and creates internal conflict, but the "midwife" aspect remains underdeveloped beyond metaphorical ties to nurturing the island. Her motivations shift abruptly from hoarding to sharing.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Central action (recovering diaries) propels the narrative, but the resolution feels compressed. The arc is clear within constraints, yet pacing stumbles in balancing introspection and plot progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, sensory-rich description of the maelstrom-surrounded island creates immersive atmosphere. The orchard’s paradoxical stillness and the moon’s role heighten thematic tension through evocative environment.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong imagery and metaphor (e.g., "wisdom grown in secrecy vs. shared") elevate the story, but emotional impact feels somewhat generalized. The theme is explicit rather than subtly revealed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Some phrases border on lyrical cliché ("whispering secrets," "living pulse"). Conceptually inventive (floating island, memory-restore through diaries), but execution occasionally leans on familiar fantasy tropes without subverting them.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The story succeeds in weaving assigned elements into a cohesive whole, though a few feel obligatory (e.g., "critical midwife"). The ending achieves thematic resonance but lacks lingering ambiguity for deeper reflection.</comment>
