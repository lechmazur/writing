<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations (healing physical and psychological wounds to counter warmongering) are largely consistent, but the lumberjack's transition to healer feels underexplored despite his "gracefully awkward" duality being well-woven through physical details like calloused hands and flannel. The coded letter's role in his nightmare-driven revelation slightly strains emotional plausibility.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot is structurally coherent with clear progression from injury to transformation, but the coded letter's sudden shift from "future war relic" to warmonger recruitment requires greater narrative scaffolding. The pacing works within constraints, though the resolution feels truncated, undermining the arc's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere effectively contrasts ossuary restaurant's morbid elegance with urban grit, but sensory detail relies heavily on visual aesthetics (bones behind glass, city lights). Mara's "gravel and care" voice and the salve's ancient recipe add depth, yet the bistro's connection to the city's broader world remains superficial, weakening thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Linguistic precision ("harsh tenderness," "quiet rebellion") and metaphors (bones as witness, city as pulse) elevate the narrative. Subtext about healing as resistance and war's psychological echoes are potent. However, ending resolves too neatly, dampening the haunting potential of nightmares-as-revamped-responsibility.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in subverting "healing traditions" as resistance against warmongers, avoiding clich√©d lumberjack-to-hero arcs. However repetitive descriptors ("bone-settling," "centuries-old") and the coded letter's "pulsing symbols" veer toward genre tropes. Emotional stakes are shown effectively but lack visceral surprise.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Compelling central metaphor (war vs. healing) anchors the story, but overstuffed themes (individual trauma, systemic violence, cultural memory) overwhelm the tight word limit. The ending achieves poignancy without closure, though inconsistent tonal precision and underdeveloped secondary elements reduce memorability.</comment>
