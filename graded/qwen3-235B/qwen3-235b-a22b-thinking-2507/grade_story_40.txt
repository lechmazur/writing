<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Character's reincarnation and guilt are clear but underdeveloped; motivations (atonement, disruption) are implied without full emotional or psychological complexity. Parallel between toy soldier and Leo is sharp, but character voice sometimes feels inconsistent between narration and dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Storm-driven chance encounter provides efficient catalyst; recipe quest creates satisfying emotional arc. Pacing and cohesion work within constraints, though transitions between scenes (library to chart) lack narrative weight. Resolution ties motif to theme but feels slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Libraries-as-possibility and storm atmosphere are evocative but underutilized; sensory details (mop water, paper smell) intermittently immerse. Hospital/recipe library disconnect weakens setting logic. Guilt-as-haunting informs mood but lacks physical-world cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Imaginative use of metaphor (custard = courage, soldier = shared loss) elevates; ending avoids sentimentality while delivering thematic resonance. Subtext about healing through shared vulnerability is potent. Occasionally heavy-handed (e.g., "tentatively fierce"), but lyrical brevity works in its favor.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids generic transitions but shows AI痕迹 in occasional abstraction ("echoing splash of forgotten tanks"). Some phrasing leans toward flowery ("cracking cynicism") but mostly avoids purple prose. Emotional nuance from actions/objects (Leo’s sleeve gesture) over explicit stating. Tropes (storm = inner turmoil) minimally subverted but functional.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere into emotionally resonant parable; brevity and theme (non-cure healing) feel intentional. Integration of required components is purposeful but uneven—some (recipe library, guilt) elevate, others (goldfish backstory) distract. Lingering thought on courage-as-process is effective.</comment>
