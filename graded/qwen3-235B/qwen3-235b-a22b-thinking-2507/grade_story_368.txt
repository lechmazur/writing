<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Streetwise traits shape actions effectively, but emotional depth remains surface-level. Motivation is clear but motivations lack visceral connection or complexity beyond narrative function.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong structural cohesion within constraints; pacing manages to suggest an arc but some plot logic (e.g. curse's sudden reversal) feels compressed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Elements unify around a central metaphor; slight unevenness in emotional grounding slightly tempers otherwise polished execution.</comment>
