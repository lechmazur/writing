<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's melancholy and motivation to restore sacred practices are clear but underdeveloped; interactions with Captain hint at depth without full realization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Narrative arc is complete but rushed, especially in resolving emotional stakes within the tight word limit; cause/effect of spilled tea feels contrived yet effective.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid steampunk details immerse reader in tactile atmosphere; symbolic use of rust, steam, and cramped spaces deepens mood more effectively than most sub-500-word stories.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Masterful use of paradoxical imagery ("crooked hope," "iron bones"); lyrical prose elevates thematic resonance without sacrificing narrative momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids clich√©s through unconventional syntheses (sacred geometry in tea stains, harmonic rituals in machinery); occasional ornate phrasing risks distraction but mostly earns its weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><grade>Creative combination of elements achieves thematic cohesion; some components (tea leaf method) feel more instrumental than organic, slightly undercutting overall polish.</grade>
