<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is emotionally resonant but lacks psychological complexity; the interplay between his actions and inner decay is effective but insufficiently layered to fully transcend archetypal "fallen noble" tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Non-linear structure creates thematic tension but sacrifices narrative momentum; the abrupt shift to Chamber 3's crisis feels underdeveloped despite its thematic purpose as a literal and metaphorical combustion.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive with precise sensory details (ozone, steel wings), though the combustion lab's atmospheric potential feels underutilized as more than symbolic backdrop.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Potent use of metaphor (tickets as armor, combustion as truth-seeking force) elevates the craft; the ending's ambiguity successfully reinforces the theme but sacrifices emotional catharsis.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose avoids overt clich√©s but borders on overwrought symbolism ("paper ghosts"); the fusion of high-tech drone and nostalgic reconstruction offers freshness, though some phrases ("hollow recklessness") verge on recycled profundity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High cohesion despite numerous elements; the lab's cursed nature remains underexplained but effectively functions as both plot device and existential metaphor within the constraints.</comment>
