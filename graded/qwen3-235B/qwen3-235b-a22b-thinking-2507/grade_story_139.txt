<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Brother Kael's single-mindedness drives the plot, but internal conflict or growth is absent; his motivation to avenge his master is clear but underexplored beyond vengeance as a rigid trait.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent, with logical cause/effect relationships, but the rushed climax and lack of tension beyond the final confrontation weaken the arc's emotional payoff within the word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (e.g., “spectral breath” mist) create atmosphere, but the mountain setting feels more like a dramatic backdrop than an integral force shaping character or plot.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sharp metaphors (“unraveling like smoke”) and a twist on vengeance-as-intellectualism elevate the story, but the resolution’s elegance outshines underdeveloped subtext about confronting one’s shadow.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Originality in tooth-mark analysis as a supernatural cipher stands out, but “monastery burning” and the “dark reflection” lean on genre tropes without sufficient subversion; prose leans into ornate description over precision.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cohesive integration of elements is uneven—e.g., the shipping label feels tacked onto the backstory—but the flute’s imperfections as a weapon redeems some narrative ambition.</comment>
