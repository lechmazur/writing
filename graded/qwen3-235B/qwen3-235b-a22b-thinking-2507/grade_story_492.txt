<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character traits are present but thinly developed; the blend of distraction and technical mastery feels authentic, but motivations shift abruptly between self-preservation and altruism without sufficient emotional groundwork.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot momentum is undermined by compressed pacing; the action sequence resolving through crystal realignment feels abrupt, and coherence suffers from underdeveloped stakes despite a clear beginning-middling-end framework.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (neon rain, spitting data nodes) create an immersive, oppressive atmosphere; the setting becomes a tangible extension of the characters' desperation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (fractured illusions as literal/societal brokenness) operate subtly; the ending's thematic clarity is weakened by the protagonist's emotional detachment, limiting emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in cyberpunk-smithy fusion and subversion of "rebel inventor" tropes; however, descriptions occasionally rely on worn cyberpunk motifs (holograms, grimy alleys) without fresh reinvention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Story coheres around core ideas but falters in balancing poetic imagery with narrative clarity; the brief format effectively focuses on a single transformative act, though some thematic threads remain unresolved.</comment>
