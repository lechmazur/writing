<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mix of strength in contrasting traits (jovial vs. reluctant) but underdeveloped inner conflict; motivation tied to tradition feels imposed rather than organic. Dialogue lacks distinct voice for a sellsword, blending generic grit with underexplored depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear cause-effect between telescope malfunction and garden collapse anchors plot, but pacing feels compressed; tradition ritual as resolution relies on abstract stakes with minimal setup. Time capsule burial's emotional weight emerges abruptly rather than through earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive with vivid, specific details (writhing lavender, singing bushes) that enhance thematic tension; tone contrasts (elegant vs. chaotic) and sensory layering elevate atmosphere. Over-reliance on compound descriptors occasionally dilutes impact.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Metaphors like "withering vow" as both magical contract and mental state add depth; emotional arc (doubt vs. hope) is palpable but surface-level. Ending's humor feels tonally jarring rather than thematically resonant. Subtext about inherited tradition is implied but underexplored.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Some fresh imagery (moon-bloom vines, truth-berry bushes) avoids clichés, but uneven control over prose density—swings between lush details and sparse character interiority. Time capsule as "treasure" is conceptually striking but undercontextualized within the world's logic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Story coheres around central object and ritual but strains under weight of thematic and elemental overload. Elements often feel juxtaposed rather than interwoven; brevity works best for tone but undermines nuanced exploration of tradition/identity. Lingering reflection is evoked but not fully earned.</comment>
