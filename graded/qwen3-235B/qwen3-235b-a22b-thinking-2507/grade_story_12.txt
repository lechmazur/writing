<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations (grieving through cartography, longing for Elara) are present but occasionally vague; emotional resonance feels abstract rather than viscerally developed through specific actions beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear emotional arc from stagnation to realization, but pacing occasionally slows (e.g., excessive hologram descriptions) and some narrative leaps (tile’s memory activation) require greater contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nuanced contrast between sterile futurism and organic memories works, but sensory details inconsistently applied (e.g., ad-panels flicker but lack tactile or olfactory counterparts).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (tiles as memory, rivers as emotional currents) deepen theme; ending resonates conceptually but risks overtelling with “unmeasurable” epiphany rather than letting symbolism breathe.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality in fusing cartography with grief, but some phrasing (“hollowed him,” “final message”) veers toward overused emotional shorthand; tonal consistency slightly uneven.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements (tile, mall, kayaking) coalesce into a cohesive emotional narrative, though the story leans heavily on abstract introspection that could benefit from sharper visceral moments.</comment>
