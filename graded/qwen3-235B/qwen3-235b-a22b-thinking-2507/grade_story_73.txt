<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's steadiness is shown through actions, but emotional depth remains superficial. The humming rebellion adds nuance but feels underdeveloped. Motivation is clear but lacks internal conflict exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically from ritual failure to spectral breach to resolution, but pacing feels compressed in final act. The arc resolves cleanly, though the central conflict's brevity undercuts emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral descriptions of jungle-vined temples, shimmering heat haze, and whispered chants create immersive atmosphere. The "raucous silence" juxtaposition is particularly evocative though some sensory details verge on generic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong symbolism in mending ritual ruptures through sunlight and glyphs resonates thematically. Lacks deeper subtext about preservation vs. adaptation. Shows more than tells, but finales could linger longer on emotional residue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Some overwrought phrasing ("thick with unshed tears") emerges, but overall style balances lyricism with restraint. "Kindrelize" feels purposeful rather than archaic. Avoids major tropes but occasionally over-explains metaphysical mechanics.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Stories about collapsing timelines are well-worn, but the specific ritual focus and tactile resolution method keep it fresh. Ending feels complete yet leaves questions about ritual's long-term fragility.</comment>
