<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation feels half-formed; claustrophobia and marine research ties are underexplored, while emotional arcs rely too heavily on passive tasting rather than active decisions. The protagonist's academic drive to study humans lacks tangible connection to his oceanographer identity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot hinges on contemplative tasting sequence but creates forward motion primarily through internalized epiphany. Pacing lingers beautifully but lacks tangible stakes or clear arc - begins/ends with similarly weighted melancholy without meaningful progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lavish sensory details immerse readers in tea house atmosphere; floating rock setting creates evocative tension between deep-sea and surface worlds. Atmosphere masterfully supports thematic duality through specific tastes/smells but underutilizes setting's visual surrealism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Evocative metaphors (jam's acid/sugar balance as emotional analogue) elevate storytelling, but surface-level emotional equivalence between coral bleaching and personal erosion feels simplistic. Subtextual exploration of healing rituals is intriguing yet underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Some overused naturalistic metaphors ("tide of claustrophobia") and excessively poetic descriptors ("quietly bold resolve") threaten authenticity. Emotional resonance often relies on stated concepts rather than organic subtext, with moments of slightly mechanistic scene transitions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Story achieves cohesion but elements often operate in parallel rather than integration - marine scientist identity feels appended rather than foundational. Atmospheric strength contrasts with uneven thematic weight; memorable vignette but lacks narrative urgency.</comment>
