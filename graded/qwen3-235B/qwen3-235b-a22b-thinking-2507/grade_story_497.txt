<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's daydreaming is stated but underexplored; her scholarly motivation aligns with her actions but lacks emotional depth or internal conflict to justify her transformation into a "herald".</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure balances discovery and resolution, but the decoding logic feels rushed. The satellite's role in translating scuff marks is under-mechanized, and the short word count weakens the emotional arc's weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid aquatic imagery and the icy palace create immersive atmosphere, though the "cursed lake" and glacial timeframe are atmospheric overkill rather than narrative necessities.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking use of metaphor (threads, light, ice) elevates the theme; the ending resonates emotionally, though explicit declarations of "compassion" occasionally undercut subtler subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through unique combinations (satellite + ice skates), but some phrases ("liquid twilight," "pristine chaos") border on ornamental abstraction. Emotional resonance is strong but not entirely earned.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>Elements cohere into a haunting whole, though the glacial timeframe and "seldom regular" motif feel like narrative garnish. The ending’s thematic force justifies most choices.</grade>
