<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character's motivation feels abstract rather than psychologically nuanced; emotional transitions rely heavily on intellectual epiphanies rather than organic development. The "boldly timid" trait remains under-explained through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Circular structure works within constraints, but key plot device (key's dual purpose) reveals awkwardly through exposition rather than earned understanding. Causes/effects of system liberalization remain vague.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visually immersive through precise mineralogical details (halite light refractions, brine acoustics), though ecological logic of sentient salt mines strains credibility. Atmosphere beautifully mirrors emotional transitions.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (bird formation as evolutionary metaphor, data liberation as personal metamorphosis) elevate the piece, though some thematic heavy-handedness occurs ("interconnected vulnerability" statement). Ending resonates.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through mineral-based biomechanics, but contains occasional "poetic" phrasing clusters that border on stylistic excess ("joyfully tragic" repetition). Nuanced emotional shifts undercut by explicit declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High stylistic ambition pays off in atmospheric cohesion; assigned elements combine into cohesive exploration of systemic adaptability. The key's symbolic payoff satisfies despite mechanical shortcuts.</comment>
