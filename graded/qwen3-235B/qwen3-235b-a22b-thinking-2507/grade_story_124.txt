<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara’s "skittish" nature is surface-level, with underexplored inner conflict; her ballet-driven method lacks emotional justification, and her arc feels abrupt despite thematic resonance of memory and grace.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plot lacks traditional structure—no rising action or resolution, just a closed loop. The method feels symbolic but under-explained, weakening causality between action and outcome.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sensory details like frayed threads and humming systems are strong, but the lunar setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than an active force shaping plot or character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors elevate the prose (ballet as neural repair), but overwrought language and lack of emotional realism dilute the story’s urgency and staying power.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unique premise (ballet meets sci-fi neural repair) is undercut by generic descriptors ("pulsed with latent energy") and a tidy resolution lacking subversive depth.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Idea-rich but emotionally distant; poetic language outpaces narrative urgency. Cohesion falters under the weight of stylistic flourishes and underdeveloped character psychology.</comment>
