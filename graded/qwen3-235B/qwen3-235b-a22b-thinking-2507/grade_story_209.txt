<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character's buried guilt drives the story, but motivations are implied through symbolism rather than fully dramatized. The wife's dying words provide psychological complexity but lack sufficient backstory to make the confession emotionally devastating rather than conceptually poignant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Non-linear flashbacks intercut with technical actions create tension, but the tight word limit strains the arc's emotional payoff. The plot structure coherently connects the echo measurement to the character's catharsis, though the mapping motivation remains underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory details layer rust and static electricity into a tactile experience. The abandoned-water-tower sequence uses verticality masterfully for emotional weight. The radio wave garden's mechanical pulse contrasts effectively with the organic decay.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonant frequency as metaphor for suppressed grief is brilliant. The "despairing cheer" tone works through paradoxical descriptions. While the ending avoids pat resolution, the emotional beats risk becoming overwrought through accumulation of symbolic objects.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in mapping psychic trauma onto physical landscapes, avoiding clich√©d redemption arcs. Some phrases ("bruised twilight") verge on over-conceptualizing sorrow. The character's technical expertise avoids formulaic psychology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements unite through the central metaphor of mapping - railways, radio waves, emotional topography. The "artfully messy" descriptor feels superficially applied. Each object (hairbrush, ruined antenna) contributes thematically rather than existing as checklist items.</comment>
