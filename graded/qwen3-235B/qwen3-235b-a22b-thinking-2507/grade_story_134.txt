<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear but superficially tied to magic elements; character's politeness lacks psychological depth beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Coherent character arc disrupted by compressed pacing; some plot developments feel abrupt (e.g., sudden shift to "static hiss").</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visceral sensory fusion of mystical and domestic (grow-lights/salt tears) creates haunting atmosphere; setting as active antagonist against memory.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors (crystals as "cultural timestamps") and subtext about erasure elevate the narrative; ending lacks emotional resonance despite strong thematic scaffolding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh concept inversion—sorcery framed through anthropological extraction, not spellcasting; avoids clichés through precise, unsettling details (detergent erasing history).</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements cohere thematically but unevenly weighted; reliance on gimmicky dialogue with trees occasionally undermines the story's poignant core ideas.</comment>
