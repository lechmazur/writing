<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Observer lacks concrete personality beyond abstract descriptors; motivations explained through thematic assertions rather than organic behavior; actions driven by cosmic necessity rather than character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Whale-driven resolution feels schematic rather than earned; plot mechanics rely on mystical causality rather than organic progression; thematic endpoint achieved but structural cohesion suffers from condensed metaphysical leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere dominates through tactile decay of lighthouse and aqueous spiritualism; sensory details (salt, decay, vibrations) ground the supernatural in physicality; haunted spatial logic elevates coherence despite fantastical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symbolism resonates regarding cultural preservation but emotional engagement limited by diffuse narration; whale's call as metaphysical method lacks visceral impact; theme is clear but delivery risks didacticism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Phrases like "undercurrent of wisdom" verge on trope repetition; abstract concepts substitute for tangible stakes; metaphors feel familiar (seeds of history, tides of time) rather than transformative; tone occasionally collapses into self-seriousness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements forced into mystical symmetry; themes of heritage salvage feel externally imposed rather than organically discovered; story's brevity creates conceptual compression rather than profound concision; lingering conceptual impression outweighs emotional memory.</comment>
