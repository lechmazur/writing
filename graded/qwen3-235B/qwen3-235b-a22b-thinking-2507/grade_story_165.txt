<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s gentleness is tied to her healing magic but lacks internal conflict; her motivations are clear but surface-level, leaving little room for nuanced emotional depth or character evolution beyond symbolic role.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arc is complete, but pacing feels compressed—transitions between discovery and resolution rely heavily on exposition; cause/effect logic holds, but tighter emotional beats would strengthen momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, mournful atmosphere in the dwarven city contrasts beautifully with the garden’s rebirth; evocative sensory details tie setting to theme, though the surface world feels underdeveloped compared to the underground.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (butterfly, “joyful terror”) resonate, and the ending’s thematic payoff elevates the narrative; however, some telling (“crushing silence,” “terrifying joy”) undercuts subtlety in emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subverts “justice as punishment” trope effectively, but dwarven guilt and restorative plot thread into familiar mythic beats; language occasionally leans on ornate descriptions without fully avoiding clichéd emotional cues.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Elements merge cohesively into a unified theme-driven narrative; while polished, the brevity prevents deeper exploration of the dwarves’ history or Elara’s personal stakes, leaving some potential unmet.</comment>
