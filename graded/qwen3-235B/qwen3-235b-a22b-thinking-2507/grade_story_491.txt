<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Past as a fisher informs his patience and tactile relationship with the quilt, but motivation to "find wisdom" feels under-explored - actions rely more on poetic gesture than psychological consistency.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fabric unraveling drives plot with symbolic logic, but the arc hinges on metaphysical causality that strains coherence; ending resonates thematically even if structural transitions feel too convenient.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush, tactile contrasts between maritime roughness and botanical fragility create haunting atmosphere; extinct plants' "scent of phantom blooms" and "hush once a baby’s lullaby ends" frame mood with visceral precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors like "eternity in a thread" and pollen-releasing text fragments offer layered subtext; emotional payoff feels earned through juxtaposition of decay/rebirth imagery against fisherman's calloused pragmatism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Verdant descriptions occasionally slip into purple prose ("silence a stark contrast to the ocean’s roar"), but tactile immediacy of unraveling quilt and philosophical symbols prevent excessive ornamentation from diminishing impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cohesive despite fantastical premise; elements like wristband-as-bookmark and quilt-stitch-pollen causality require suspension of disbelief that demands thematic payoff this story almost achieves but occasionally over-explains.</comment>
