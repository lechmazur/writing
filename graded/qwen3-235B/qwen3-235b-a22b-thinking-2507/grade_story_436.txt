<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong motivation and emotional clarity, but lacks deeper exploration of Elias' internal conflicts beyond grief; emotional responses are reactive rather than psychologically layered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Exceptional temporal urgency and cause-effect clarity; some minor pacing unevenness during decoding sequence, but the library's closure provides structural cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is masterfully rendered through sensory alchemy—scorched stone, lavender-regret scent—but the desert setting could better influence plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Profound emotional resonance through tactile metaphors; some explicit emotional cues ("painful joy") undercut subtler subtext; ending achieves elegiac circularity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original use of recipes as magical vernacular; dream catchers risk cultural flattening; language walks tightrope between lyricism and overwrought ornamentation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Achieves thematic unity despite ambitious element load; the spoon/oracle connection prevents fragmentation; brevity serves ritualistic repetition inherent to alchemical obsession.</comment>
