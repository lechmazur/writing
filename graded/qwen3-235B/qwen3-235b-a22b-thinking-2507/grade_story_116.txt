<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Character's motivation is cerebral but emotionally distant; inner conflict remains abstract rather than visceral. Voice lacks distinctiveness in first-person fragments.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from broken tool to completed map, but momentum stalls in abstract descriptions. Pacing prioritizes poetic resonance over visceral progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Phenomenal sensory cohesion—neon bleeding, jasmine scent, rain-slicked windows—create an immersive, haunting atmosphere that deepens narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lyrical prose and boundary-as-metaphor resonate, but emotional engagement falters due to distant introspection over lived experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in juxtaposing mechanical (polaroids, maps) with ephemeral (dandelion clocks, forgotten songs). Occasional purple prose ("velvet void") slightly mars otherwise fresh imagery.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Bleeds conceptual cohesion but sacrifices intimacy. Stylistic audacity elevates it above genre templates, yet restraint would strengthen its haunting core.</comment>
