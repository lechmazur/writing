<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ms. Thorne’s motivation—reclaiming lost knowledge—is clear, but her internal conflict between fear and urgency feels underexplored. Her “righteously flawed” nature is stated more than demonstrated through nuanced action, and her alien identity could deepen her choices beyond the surface-level connection to her homeworld’s trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but rushed. The organ’s resonance as a method drives the narrative, yet the transition from setup to climax lacks tension buildup. The connection between the beginning (fear of exposure) and end (embracing vulnerability) is implied but underdeveloped within the tight word count, weakening the arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (cracked marble, steam, Bach’s prelude) immerse readers in the bathhouse’s haunting atmosphere. The setting’s decay and repurposing mirror the theme of recovering lost knowledge, enhancing both mood and symbolism. However, the alien’s perspective on human history occasionally feels layered on top of the setting rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (sound as a universal bridge, fear vs. resilience) are evocative. The ending’s thematic resonance—knowledge preserved through vulnerability—feels earned. The story avoids explicit emotional telling, instead embedding subtext in imagery (e.g., flickering disguise). The final lines resonate as a satisfying emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in the fusion of alien mythos with earthly history. Avoids clichés: the organ-as-key mechanic is inventive, and the bathhouse’s transformation feels purposeful. The prose is precise, avoiding florid excess. The alien’s trauma isn’t reduced to a trope but woven into human parallels. A rare layer of subversive emotional logic elevates it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>The story synthesizes its constraints into a cohesive whole. Every element serves the theme (e.g., the bathhouse’s rebirth mirrors the alien’s liberation), though the organ’s role strains plausibility slightly. The brevity feels intentional, leaving a resonant, lingering impact on fear and curiosity. Not flawless, but distinct and memorable.</comment>
