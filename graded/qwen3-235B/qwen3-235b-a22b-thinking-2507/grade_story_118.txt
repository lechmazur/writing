<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's traits are expressed through actions and objects, but lacks emotional depth and complex inner conflict. Motivation is present but under-explored beneath surface rituals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Story has clear progression but feels abbreviated; the wax formation creates pseudo-climax, though no substantial change occurs beyond symbolic resolution of tension.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distilled atmosphere through sensory contradictions (sterile corridors vs. beeswax warmth) and "uniform peculiarities" creates compelling emotional dissonance despite limited worldbuilding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphoric density (wax coding, sound-as-trauma) and thematic interplay of anchoring vs dissolving leave lingering resonance despite minimalist plot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Some overwritten phrases ("merry bitterness") strain credibility, but original concept execution elevates above formulaic structures; avoids most AI-pattern pitfalls through specific symbolic systems.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere intellectually but emotionally maintain distance; concise form feels intentional, with creative integration of anchor motifs across multiple narrative layers.</comment>
