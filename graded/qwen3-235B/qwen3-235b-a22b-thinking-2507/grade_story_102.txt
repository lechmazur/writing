<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weak psychological complexity; inconsistent emotional layers in transformation; mercenary’s fear-driven agency is clear but lacks interiority beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Familiar hero’s journey arc shoehorned into constraints; prophecy’s ticking clock creates urgency but resolution feels abrupt; logical gaps in how key interacts with prophecy.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Richly textured, often to excess; atmosphere dominates at cost of narrative precision; setting becomes character but occasionally obscures plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elevated poetic language mostly serves theme; imagery (e.g., “voice fraying like old parchment”) lingers; ending’s ambiguity rewards contemplation despite minor overwriting.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mixed originality; dollhouse key’s symbolic weight stands out but other elements (drowned quarter, mentor) tread familiar speculative fiction ground; tonal pretension risks eclipsing authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Highly crafted yet constrained by brief; thematic concerns (fear vs action) resonate, but narrative compactness sacrifices emotional heft; feels like excerpt from larger work.</comment>
