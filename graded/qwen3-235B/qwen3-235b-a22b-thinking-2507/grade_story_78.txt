<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character remains conceptually distant - "late-blooming" and "softly militant" traits are stated rather than demonstrated through specific actions. Motivation for cosmic inquiry feels intellectualized rather than emotionally grounded in lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a simple arc of philosophical transformation but relies heavily on abstraction rather than concrete development. The progression from coercion to acceptance is conceptually clear but lacks dramatized incidents to provide narrative weight within the constrained form.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic atmosphere is powerfully rendered through sparse but vivid imagery ("skeletal ruins", "tender shoots through ash"). Sensory details are present but could be more varied across modalities to deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Exceptional use of metaphor and cosmic imagery creates lasting impressions. The ending resonates thematically, though emotional impact is slightly undermined by persistent abstraction. Subtext about living with loss is clear and thought-provoking.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing with fresh metaphors ("constellations as equations", "grime like sedimented time"). No artificial-seeming transitions or overused tropes. Approach to grief through astronomical observation is distinctive and thoughtfully developed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The elements are generally well-integrated into a cohesive whole, with atmospheric consistency throughout. While individual components work together effectively, the story's brevity limits the emotional depth and narrative richness required for truly elite publication.</comment>
