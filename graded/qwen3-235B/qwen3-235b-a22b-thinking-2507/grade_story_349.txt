<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character's cynically hopeful nature is evident but lacks nuanced evolution; motivation crystallizes late, with insufficient prior groundwork to fully earn the emotional shift.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but strained by the speed dating event's abrupt insertion; pacing balances atmosphere and action but occasionally loses momentum in static reflection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, sensorially rich atmosphere merges with melancholic tone; setting and mood are masterfully fused, though the observatory’s historical weight feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Emotional resonance and symbolic imagery (herbs as mercy, horizon as liminality) elevate impact; ending with axes and unresolved hope is poignant, though subtext remains surface-level.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Originality in merging sci-fi and fantasy is undercut by AI-typical sensory clichés ("ancient smoke," "grey snow") and a speed dating event that feels tonally disjointed rather than subversive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elements are mostly cohesive but some (speed dating, drone pilot context) feel imposed rather than intrinsic; the lyrical prose occasionally masks narrative gaps.</comment>
