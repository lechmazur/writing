<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character's aloofness is evident through tactile interactions and internal monologue; transformation from fear to surrender logically driven by his orphaned status and quest for resilience. Underdeveloped backstory slightly weakens full psychological complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Limited by word count but maintains arc through physical (loosening jar lid) and metaphorical (surrendering stones) actions. Anomaly's sudden appearance strains logic; resolution feels compressed yet emotionally satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gritty garage details (dust motes, rusted jar) contrast with mystical anomaly seamlessly. Atmospheric tension between ordinariness and supernatural elements enhanced by vivid sensory paradoxes (cool stone kiss vs floating impossibility).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Metaphors (stones as emotional anchors) and symbols (lottery ticket as non-literal salvation) create thematic resonance. Ending achieves earned epiphany rather than trite closure. Underlying theme of finding agency in chaos is potent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Risks clich√©d orphan archetype but subverts through psychological specificity. Anomaly avoids genre tropes through ambiguity. Some poetic flourishes border on excess ("silent constellations"), but emotional subtext remains nuanced rather than programmatic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Constrained excellence: tight weaving of required elements into resonant whole. Emotional truth outweighs structural experimentation; leaves lingering meditation on trauma and transcendence. Stylistic control impressive within limitations.</comment>
