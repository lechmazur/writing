<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character’s “mild zealot” trait and motivation are consistent but underdeveloped; introspection lacks layered complexity to fully humanize his obsession with legacy and sacrifice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Plot’s static structure focuses on internal realization; pacing is controlled but lacks narrative drive beyond a single thematic pivot, straining plausibility within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich, atmospheric sensory details (e.g., ozone, humming machinery, Alpine isolation) amplify the eerie, intellectual tone and complement the fragmented historical context.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors and quiet symbolism (e.g., pocket watch craftsmanship mirroring human sacrifice) create lingering emotional resonance, though the ending leans on abstraction over nuance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Original premise undermined by occasional pretension (e.g., “ozone scent of unstable equations”); avoids clichés but risks artificial introspection through over-embellished concepts.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion and intellectual ambition; slight awkwardness in blending scientific and mystical elements, yet the tight prose and poignant conclusion justify its brevity.</comment>
