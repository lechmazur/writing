<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is conceptually rich but underdeveloped through action; motivation drives plot but emotional nuance is undercut by over-reliance on explicit internal monologue ("lovingly hateful" stated rather than dramatized).</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot movement is logical but strained by compressed scope; ritual mechanics feel rushed despite lyrical descriptions, with cause-effect connections requiring reader generosity to bridge narrative leaps.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is exceptional - the vault's 'icy warmth' and spectral petals create tactile cognitive dissonance that mirrors thematic tension; sensory details are inventive and emotionally resonant.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (fracture's 'unraveling song,' memory as fruit preservation) create layered meaning; ending chord resonates thematically but emotional payoff feels slightly preordained rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through conceptual originality (petal tracking ritual, memory-as-theft) but occasionally succumbs to ornamental prose and over-explained emotions; voice remains distinctive despite minor rhythmic unevenness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere through elegant metaphoric unity but suffer from uneven execution; the fruit vault and petals could deepen thematic resonance more effectively. Compact structure feels intentional though underworked.</comment>
