<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation shifts from cold control to compassionate understanding effectively, driven by the heirloom and washcloth. However, her inner conflict feels slightly rushed and could use deeper emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot is tightly constructed within the word limit, with clear stakes and resolution. However, the pivotal shift in her approach feels a touch expedited without fully exploring the psychological resistance to her grandmother’s lesson.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid but overly reliant on abstract descriptors (e.g., "cathedral of iridescent crystal"). Sensory details hint at atmosphere but lack specificity to ground the alien environment firmly in the reader’s mind.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Impactful metaphors (gardening as compassion, the washcloth as empathy) elevate the theme. The ending delivers emotional resonance, but the central theme is occasionally stated rather than subtly embedded.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids major clichés but leans on the "heirloom memory" trope. Language is mostly purposeful, though phrases like "living pulse" flirt with abstraction. Subtlety in emotional shifts is occasionally sacrificed for thematic clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesive but unevenly integrated. The heirloom and washcloth feel essential, while the extraterrestrial setting’s uniqueness could have been deeper. Lingering themes on control vs. compassion are clear but not revolutionary.</comment>
