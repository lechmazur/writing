<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding occasionally veers into cyberpunk clichés, undercutting originality. The "interconnected lives" method introduces human networks but lacks specificity. Emotional beats like Elara's solemnity avoid over-explanation, yet some descriptors (e.g., "neon-lit rooftop garden") border on generic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements are largely cohesive, particularly the key's symbolic role and rooftop garden as thematic linchpin. Some assigned elements (e.g., "interconnected lives") feel tacked on, though the story’s emotional arc and atmosphere carry it above formulaic constructs.</comment>
