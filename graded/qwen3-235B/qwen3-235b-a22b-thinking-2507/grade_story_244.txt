<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Limited emotional complexity in the swordswoman's internal conflict; backstory feels somewhat underexplored despite effective integration of her guilt and resolve.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc with cause-effect logic, but relies on abrupt transitions between exposition and action that slightly disrupt narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative sensory contrasts (neon/electricity vs. organic decay) deepen atmosphere, though the tribal mask's connection to the high-tech setting remains under-articulated.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong metaphoric cohesion (labyrinth as past, light as release) elevates thematic impact; ending achieves emotional resonance through symbolic action rather than explicit explanation.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids generic descriptors but occasionally over-relies on adjectival phrases like "mellow intensity" that border on vague poeticism; metaphors remain largely fresh.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements interlock thematically (mask/rosebush/door as interconnected symbols) with minimal redundancy, creating a purposeful whole that transcends its brevity.</comment>
