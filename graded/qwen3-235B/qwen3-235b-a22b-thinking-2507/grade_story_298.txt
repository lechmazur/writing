<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Li Wei’s chameleon-like adaptability and “rationally impulsive” nature are conceptually tied to his role, but his internal conflicts remain underexplored, slightly diluting his dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses through logical cause-and-effect, with clear ties between the doll’s dress, the diary discovery, and the performance’s stakes. Pacing is taut within constraints, though the climax’s emotional payoff is slightly compressed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>Sense of decayed grandeur is visceral through debris-pierced light and tactile descriptions, though some elements (e.g., scent details) remain sparse, slightly undercutting total immersion.</grade>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Story excels in metaphorical richness and thematic cohesion—art as truth-keeping, trauma as performance. The ending resonates thematically, though subtle shifts in tone could deepen emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in framing art as historical excavation, avoiding genre tropes. Prose occasionally leans on poetic abstraction (“cold-case bones”) but remains purposeful. Nuanced subtext prevents cliché.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>All elements function interdependently to build a unique, thematically resonant narrative. Minor pacing quibbles and slight over-reliance on exposition prevent perfection.</comment>
