<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motive is clear but her aristocratic background lacks psychological depth; her "strangely honest" trait feels situational rather than defining her voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong narrative arc with beginning-middle-end, but the abrupt fortress fade and Archon confrontation risk feeling contrived within the tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Swamp evokes primordial dread but cosmic elements feel superimposed; pre-universe setting only superficially informs the tone rather than being organically integrated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Original premise diluted by "lone rebel vs authoritarian system" clich√©s; some ornate descriptions border on purple prose but metaphors retain freshness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story succeeds in thematic fusion of memory vs control, though cosmic implications remain underdeveloped; emotional resonance outweighs structural polish.</comment>
