<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Ferociously polite demeanor lacks deeper exploration; motivation is clear but underdeveloped through action. Nomadic background informs her resolve but isn't fully integrated into behavior or voice. Conflict reveals character through dialogue, but emotional depth remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tight structure with strong cause-effect between inciting action and resolution. Coin toss framing creates circularity, but intervening plot feels condensed rather than rushed. Secret mission stakes could be more clearly demonstrated within constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere of decay and fragile hope is vividly evoked through sensory details (dust, violets' fragility). The workshop's symbolic role as preservation space works, but environmental decay context remains vaguely sketched rather than immersed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery ("genetic song," mariner's wheel's hidden map) elevates the thematic weight. The anguished joy tone combines emotional complexity with simplicity. Dialogue lacks subtext and feels slightly constructed rather than organic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through fresh metaphors (pollen restoring soil) and nuanced tone. Some phrases ("angry tears," "living libraries") border on sentimental abstraction. Character psychology could feel more instinctively human rather than thematically convenient.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Competent integration of assigned elements creates functional narrative, but cohesion lacks transcendent quality. Certain components (coin toss, workshop) feel imposed rather than organically necessary. Lingering impression leans toward competence over memorability.</comment>
