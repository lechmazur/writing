<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation as a rebellious obituarist is conceptually strong, but her inner life remains underdeveloped; her actions align with her assigned trait, yet emotional nuance and psychological complexity are absent, making her feel more symbolic than fully human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookshelf and hidden chamber drive the plot efficiently, with humming as a logical method to restore the art. However, the abrupt discovery of the chamber and rushed revolution climax slightly undermine narrative cohesion within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Visually rich descriptions (dust motes, shifting mask, organ pipes) create an immersive, haunting atmosphere. The revolutionary context and claustrophobic bookshelf setting enhance thematic tension, though the revolution’s stakes remain underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</question><comment>Metaphors (unlived lives as obituaries, mask as collective emotion) deepen the story, with a resonant theme of preserving memory against destruction. Some emotional beats rely on abstraction (e.g., “lucid frenzy”) rather than embodied experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</question><comment>The central conceit (living obituaries, shifting mask) feels inventive, but the hidden chamber’s organ and “giant’s bookshelf” lean on fantastical tropes without fully interrogating their logic. Language occasionally veers toward ornate abstraction, bordering on purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>The story’s symbolic resonance and poetic imagery elevate it, but pacing unevenness, underdeveloped elements (e.g., revolution, labyrinth of choices), and reliance on poetic vagueness over emotional specificity prevent it from feeling fully cohesive or transcendent.</comment>
