<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is deeply tied to her loss and the sea glass, but her emotional nuance feels surface-level. Her shift from desperation to clarity lacks detailed psychological beats, and the third-person narration obscures a distinct "voice," though her actions align with her grief-driven quest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The plot’s arc—decoding, revelation, harmonic resolution—is clear despite the word limit. The transition from cosmic to oceanic data feels logically abrupt but emotionally resonant; pacing balances urgency and introspection without dragging.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Visceral imagery (frost-rimmed goggles, violet nebulae) and metaphoric setting (station as "tomb") immerse readers. Sensory details like tactile vibrations and bioluminescent light enhance tone, though the nebula’s role feels underexploited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The metaphor of the black hole as doubt and sea glass as loss resonate thematically. The ending’s subversion (acceptance over exploitation) and lyrical imagery (light "warm as shallow water") create lasting emotional impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is occasionally ornate but mostly purposeful. The twist—cosmic secrets as Earth’s oceanic pleas—avoids cliché. Emotions are shown through action (e.g., fractured light resolving data), with minimal "telling," though some phrases (e.g., "gritty whimsy") clunk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elements interweave cohesively (e.g., sea glass both symbol and catalyst). The tight word count amplifies tension rather than diluting it, and the lingering theme—beauty in impermanence—transcends its components.</comment>
