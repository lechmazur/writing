<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and driven by devotion, but some reactions (confession mid-chorus) feel rushed. Personality voice lacks distinctiveness despite first-person perspective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot structure has satisfying arc but pacing rushes resolution. Karaoke method drives action effectively; cause/effect clear but secret reveal lacks narrative weight within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Hourglass imagery is atmospheric but underutilized thematically. Chalk lines' fading works metaphorically; sensory details are vivid but inconsistently applied across environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Emotional resonance through shared grief is strong, but oversentimental turns ("whispers of promise") undercut impact. Symbolism (sharpener, sand) elevates narrative craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Original premise undercut by clich√©d emotional beats (tear-jerker father figure). Some generic descriptors ("fragile hope") compete with vivid specifics like the "taste of shared sorrow."</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cohesive despite multiple elements; integration varies from exceptional (broken sharpener) to superficial (hourglass setting). Compression works generally but betrays logic in character decisions.</comment>
