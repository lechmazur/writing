<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s motivation is clear but underdeveloped; “hope-worn knight” lacks depth beyond metaphorical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive arc with clear beginning/middle/end, but pacing falters in the final paragraphs where synthesis feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and immersive, with sensory details (e.g., “candle glow,” “salt-spray”) anchoring the surreal setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative use of paradox (“deeply superficial”) and symbolism elevates the themes, though some phrases verge on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in reframing banality as mythic; avoids clichés with fresh metaphors but occasionally slips into ornate abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements harmonize conceptually, but the narrative’s density leaves some facets (e.g., “bridge” metaphor) ambiguously resolved.</comment>
