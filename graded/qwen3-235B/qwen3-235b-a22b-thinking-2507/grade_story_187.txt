<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stoic nature informs actions, but internal conflict lacks depth; motivation is clear but insufficiently nuanced beneath surface narrative.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing maintains momentum despite constraints; plot is coherent but relies on implicit backstory rather than dramatized arc.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Evocative, immersive details in setting clash with flat descriptions of key objects like the 'bland' floorboard.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Symbols (floorboard as vessel) and tension between preservation/erasure resonate thematically, though emotional beats occasionally verge on abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; some phrasing (e.g., 'ghosts of abandoned rites') teeters on familiar phrasing without fresh subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion across elements; brevity serves the melancholic ambiguity but sacrifices character complexity.</comment>
