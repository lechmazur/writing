<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but relies heavily on exposition; voice lacks depth, and psychological reactions to ancient forces feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot progression via mirrored visions is inventive but feels rushed; reveals lack emotional weight, and the ending's pivotal choice lacks earned tension.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Evocative sensory contrasts (arctic vs. desert) enhance atmosphere, but the greenhouse's role in the cosmic implications remains underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Striking metaphors and existential tension elevate impact; the abrupt emotional climax ("began to cuddle it") undermines thematic weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose alternates between lush originality and clich√©d phrases ("bones of the earth," "fragile warmth"); subverts some tropes (coffin as time anchor) but leans on archaic diction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elements create intriguing dissonance (arctic/divine) but strain suspension of disbelief; brevity sacrifices character nuance necessary for high-stakes decisions.</comment>
