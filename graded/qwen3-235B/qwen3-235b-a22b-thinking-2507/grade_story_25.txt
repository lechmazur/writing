<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thorne’s internal conflict is well-conveyed through dense, symbolic gestures, but motivations (e.g., reconciling guilt) lack nuanced emotional depth, often resorting to abstract declarations over visceral embodiment of struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elegant conceptual loop (theater framing the reckoning) clashes with underdeveloped cause-effect in the middle; ladder analysis as method feels allegorical but lacks concrete stakes or urgency to propel the narrative forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ultraviolets and salt-cracked decay create a tactile, alien atmosphere; however, the theater audience element feels tacked on rather than organically threaded into the forest’s symbolic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Visceral metaphors (“vines whisper distance”) and thematic cohesion around freedom’s price are memorable, but relentless thematic abstraction risks muddying emotional investment despite technical prowess.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Originality shines in fusing nautical and surreal elements, yet the overuse of paradox (“fierce fidelity to brutal beauty”) occasionally substitutes for organic revelation; avoids cliché but flirts with affectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elegant fragments outweigh a unified whole; story’s logic hinges on poetic resonance over visceral engagement, feeling both daring and precariously fragile in its brevity.</comment>
