<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to avoid intimacy under the guise of professionalism is consistent and well-revealed through interiority, but her transformation feels slightly compressed for full emotional immersion despite strong thematic grounding in her role as a cuddler.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pacing leans into poetic brevity rather than strict plot logic—the abandoned-hangar sequence and speech framing connect thematically but lack the incremental cause-effect beats needed for a fully cohesive arc within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile decay metaphors (entropy, corrosion) and contrasting sterile/biological textures; the spaceport's cathedral decay motif elevates both setting and theme with precise sensory counterpoints.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (decaying starships as emotional repression, the punch as symbolic key) are potent and layered, but the ending's thematic neatness undercuts some emotional rawness that might have deepened impact beyond poetic resolution.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lyrical precision prevents overused tropes, though some phrases ("sacred space," "tangible simple things") veer into familiar introspective modes; the spaceport-farmer's market juxtaposition feels intentionally uncanny but risks feeling algorithmically curated rather than organically observed.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a cohesive portrait of emotional reckoning—while the brevity strains narrative mechanics, the thematic and atmospheric unity suggests intentional choices rather than random assemblage of prompts.</comment>
