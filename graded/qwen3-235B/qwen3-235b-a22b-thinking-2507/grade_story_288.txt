<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character development is consistent but occasionally overwritten; Elias’ motivation to create transcendent art ties to his actions, but some internal logic (e.g., his relationship to the flag’s symbolism) relies on abstraction over organic revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is emotionally resonant but structurally unbalanced; the ozone station’s urgency and Lila’s milestone create tension, but the arc’s resolution feels abrupt, relying on poetic imagery rather than earned progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile contrasts (ozone sensors vs. anvil, glacial lake vs. riot-scarred flag), but the ozone station’s scientific purpose feels underexplored as a thematic catalyst.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong emotional impact via layered metaphors (sculpture as fleeting moments, pendant as both burden and liberation); the ending’s transcendence is undercut slightly by overreliance on aphoristic dialogue.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Originality in blending post-apocalyptic elements with quiet domesticity, but strained by self-consciously "literary" phrasing (e.g., "ozone’s fragile layer," "blacksmith’s token for courage"); the flag’s symbolism feels archetypal rather than freshly imagined.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mix of cohesion and clutter; the pandemic-inflected quarantine frame and integration of craft as metaphor for human resilience are compelling, but uneven tonal shifts and occasionally hollow lyricism dilute overall impact.</comment>
