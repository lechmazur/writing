<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character is archetype-driven rather than psychologically nuanced; motivation (nostalgic duty) is clear but lacks internal conflict or evolution.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a "quest" template; the action (mapping roof tears) lacks logical connection to the abstract goal of igniting flames, but the closing revelation provides closure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Desert decay and celestial imagery create a vivid, layered atmosphere; sensory details (e.g., "gritty floor," "shattered glass") deepen immersion without overshadowing narrative.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric resonance (stars as memory/embers) elevates the plot; however, emotional impact is diluted by vague spiritualism over concrete character-driven stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overreliance on fantasy tropes (heroic quest, mystical map); strained metaphors ("skyâ€™s wounds") and abstract exposition detract from originality despite the unique desert-greenhouse contrast.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere superficially but rely heavily on assigned prompts; thematic underdevelopment and inconsistent pacing hinder cohesion.</comment>
