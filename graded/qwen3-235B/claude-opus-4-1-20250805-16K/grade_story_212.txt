<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation escapes control while weaving scientific/magical traits, but lacks emotional depth despite her voice. The "typically atypical" mind is shown through hybrid science-magic work, though her reactions remain surface-level.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear three-act arc condensed into 500 words, but reliance on "ultimatum" exposition strains coherence. The transformation sequence logically follows but resolution feels rushed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ethereal-glass-sea fusion creates vivid dissonance, with "ghost-sea" and "singing seeds" immersing readers. Lacks tactile details like soil texture or card paper quality to ground the surrealism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors bridge genetics and incantations beautifully, with boundary-membrane duality offering rich symbolism. The ending's thematic resonance lingers, though some ideas verge on abstract vagueness.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unique synthesis of biotechnology and mysticism feels fresh, while phrases like "waves that shouldn't exist" avoid clichés. Minor overuse of "surreal" descriptors and occasionally ornate sentences slightly dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cohesion exists but feels engineered—card sequences driving plot strains plausibility. The ending's message about decentralized revolution lands effectively despite tight constraints.</comment>
