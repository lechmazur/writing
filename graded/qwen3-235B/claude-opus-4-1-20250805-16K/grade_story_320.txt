<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Protagonist’s shyness remains underexplored despite first-person narration; motivation to “right cosmic imbalance” is clear but lacks personal emotional stakes beyond surface-level guilt</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure achieves coherence despite tight constraints, but social media’s role as plot driver feels underdeveloped; resolution occurs suddenly without earned catharsis or structural payoff</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Underwater city’s sensory details (brine, coral-eaten counter) create vivid immersion; atmosphere aligns with cosmic melancholy but could deepen connections between parallel timelines and physical decay</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mandala-of-possibility imagery and “letters to dead addresses” metaphor elevate the narrative; ending provokes ethical questions but relies slightly too heavily on explicitly stated regret</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</question><comment>Elements fuse cohesively but unevenly: underwater setting and photos feel organic, while social media’s integration risks feeling gimmicky; lingers emotionally but lacks thematic penetration beyond surface tragedy</comment>
