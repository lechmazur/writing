<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character is vivid but shallow; ruthlessness is established through specific acts yet lacks emotional depth. Motivation to decode rock art feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through dialogue but leans on coincidence rather than tension. Resolution feels telegraphed, with stone circle revelations lacking stakes within the tight word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fog-shrouded stones and tactile details (comb’s texture, misted breath) create immersive atmosphere. Timeframe enhances mystery but underutilizes “midnight” setting for dramatic effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphoric parallels between floristry and ancient symbolism are striking. Dialogue-heavy exposition occasionally stalls momentum, but Fibonacci motif adds thematic heft and unsettling subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original premise combines botanical violence with prehistoric codes. Avoids clichés by tying “ruthlessness” to artistic philosophy. Comb’s sentimental value humanizes rather than melodramatizes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cohesive synthesis of disparate elements into philosophical inquiry about aesthetic power. Ending’s ambiguity lingers without feeling incomplete.</comment>
