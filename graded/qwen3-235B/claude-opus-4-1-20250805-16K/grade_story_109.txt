<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Severin's duality as a cold knight awakened by personal history is hinted at but underdeveloped; his rebellion lacks nuanced internal conflict, relying too heavily on mitten-triggered nostalgia rather than organic emotional progression. Dialogue feels abrupt rather than revealing character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but feels constrained by word limit—mitten discovery to altar transformation happens too abruptly to earn the thematic revelation. Resolution with Morrison arrives mechanically, lacking tension buildup. Core logic holds but pacing suffers from compressed structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frostbitten imagery ('breath cloud in November cold,' 'frozen mitten') merges beautifully with surreal altars. The tension between sterile agent center and emotional altars creates rich atmosphere. However, 'incomplete family altars' concept feels underexplored despite strong sensory grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Powerful metaphor of wool yarn connecting remedies like 'brushstrokes' and mitten symbolizing lost things that complete puzzles elevates the narrative. The theme of integrating logic/emotion resonates clearly. Ending leans on sentimental aphorism but retains emotional resonance through tactile details like warming fingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</question><comment>Occasional purple prose ('rebellion could exist within law's boundaries') undermines subtlety. Folk remedies risk feeling like checklist items rather than deeply cultural artifacts. Emotional shifts rely partly on stated revelations rather than fully shown transformations. Secret agent center concept borders on fantastical cliché but gains originality through altar symbolism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Elements cohere better than expected in compressed format—cold knight, mitten, altars form surprisingly cohesive tension between tradition and protocol. Some surface-level thematic statements prevent deeper resonance. Leaves lingering question about institutional adaptation vs. individual transformation, but resolution feels somewhat glib.</comment>
