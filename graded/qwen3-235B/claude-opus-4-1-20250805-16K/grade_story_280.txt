<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Characters function as symbols more than fully realized beings; beekeeper’s introspection feels performative rather than earned, and Zhou’s "sweetly confrontational" tone lacks psychological complexity, reducing their dynamic to thematic abstraction over emotional truth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative momentum stalls in its middle; the conflict (sharing methods vs. isolation) resolves too tidily, with Zhou’s conversion feeling unearned. The compressed arc relies on thematic resonance over organic development within the strict word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quasar deck’s vacuum-sealed apiaries and artificial snow create a hauntingly tactile yet alien setting; sensory details (brass reflections, vibrations from cosmic phenomena) immerse the reader, though the biodome’s ecology lacks fuller integration with plot stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (bees as strategic survivors, cosmic radiation "simpler" than human noise) elevate the narrative; the closing lesson on "loneliness" lingers, though dialogue occasionally veers into didacticism, undercutting subtler human insights.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on AI-like cadences (e.g., "infinity symbols in the snow") and overly ornate phrasing ("hush of distant galaxies"). Originality shines in cosmic-bee symbiosis but falters in emotional subtext.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story’s ambition—melding biology, philosophy, and deep space—justifies its tight structure, though the ending prioritizes thematic neatness over narrative fulfillment; the symbiosis of elements works conceptually but leaves thematic questions underexplored.</comment>
