<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation to reconcile faith and logic is clear but lacks depth beyond surface traits; actions align with her traits but aren't deeply interrogated to reveal complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent arc from heresy to revelation, but pacing stumbles between decoding sequences; plot momentum driven by concept rather than organic tension within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Evocative descriptions (damp fur, cracked windows) immerse readers, but atmospheric details occasionally verge on Gothic cliché rather than deepening the story’s intellectual/spiritual themes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Emotionally resonant through layered metaphors (dust motes as angels, puzzles as faith); resolution feels slightly sentimental but underscores central themes effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dodge of AI-like tropes is deliberate, particularly in concept-originality, but stumbles into melodramatic phrases (e.g., "divine puzzles") and occasionally overwrites emotional states rather than implying them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Elements combine into a cohesive, theme-forward story that challenges dogma through logic, though the brief format leaves lingering ideas underdeveloped.</comment>
