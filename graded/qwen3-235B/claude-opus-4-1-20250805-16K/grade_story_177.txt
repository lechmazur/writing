<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's rebelliousness drives action but lacks emotional depth; motivations are conceptually tied to her role as an obituary writer yet feel more thematic than personally resonant, with inner conflicts underexplored despite expressive actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean three-act structure within constraints; plot momentum driven by labyrinthine choices leading logically to the pipe organ climax. Pacing is mostly tight, though the abrupt transition to the mask’s final possession feels underprepared.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is hauntingly immersive—giant bookshelf’s sensory details (dust motes, echoing footsteps) amplify existential stakes. The revolution’s atmosphere clashes slightly with its thematic weight but elevates tension through ambient tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Iridescent metaphors (“crescendos,” “frozen constellations”) and thematic layers about rewriting destiny elevate impact. Subtext about agency vs. inevitability is potent but occasionally oversimplified through exposition rather than organic subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceptual fusion (obituaries as rebellion, Choreography as art), though some overwritten descriptions (“impossibly tall bronze pipes”) veer toward excess. Nuanced emotional beats occasionally flatten into polemic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic cohesion belies uneven execution; elements amplify each other’s significance (e.g., mask/deed symbiosis) but the obituary premise’s full narrative potential remains only partially realized despite lingering philosophical questions.</comment>
