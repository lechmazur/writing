<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear and consistent, but the connection between Marcus's traits and actions lacks depth in pivotal moments. The ringleader role doesn't fully shape his decisions, and emotional reactions to the artifact feel underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The artifact's revelation effectively drives the plot, with cause-effect logic holding despite tight word limits. Pacing stumbles slightly during the flame's sudden protective role, but the complete arc—from discovery to destruction—feels earned.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Evocative details (zero-gravity candle, coffee-stained napkin) anchor the eerie atmosphere, but deeper integration of setting with theme is missed. The booth's isolation works well, yet spatial connections (hallway vs. floorboard artifact) lack visceral continuity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Memorable imagery (flame spelling warnings, souls in the sphere) elevates impact, but dialogue leans into cryptic clichés. The ending resonates thematically, though emotional layers feel filtered through archetype rather than raw human vulnerability.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Unique elements (zero-gravity flame, napkin's ink) subvert expectations, but ancestral wisdom remains tied to generic mysticism. The "plural voice" leans into overused supernatural tropes, and some phrases ("playful dread") verge on affected phrasing rather than organic tension.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The story balances assigned elements cohesively but unevenly—crucial pieces (napkin, artifact) feel essential while others (zero-gravity gimmick) strain suspension of disbelief. The ending suggests thematic depth but doesn't fully disentangle itself from genre conventions.</comment>
