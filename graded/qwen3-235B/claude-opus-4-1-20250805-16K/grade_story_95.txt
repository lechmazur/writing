<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Priestly traits remain surface-level; motivation to decode storms through fairy tales is intriguing but underexplored—connections between Marcus' weariness and his methodology remain unprobed. His final ascension lacks character depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fragmented chronology creates cohesion issues despite ambitious scope. Episodic structure (arrival, breakthrough, final moment) struggles to maintain dramatic momentum within tight word count. Causal logic between glowing buttons and linguistic decoding remains underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Conceptual atmosphere intrigues but execution lacks visceral immediacy. Sensory immersion in storm-chasing environments remains superficial—could smell ozone less than see radar screens. The "cathedral" transformation feels abrupt rather than earned.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid metaphors transform technical jargon into poetry. The haunting final image lingers. Subtext about lost languages through environmental phenomena offers philosophical weight, though some "show-don't-tell" gaps dilute emotional impact during key revelations.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids formula through audacious fusion of science/mysticism. Specificity of bone buttons containing legends prevents generic fantasy tropes. "Thistledown" lift-off edges toward cliché but redeems itself through lyrical nuance. No significant purple prose, though occasional over-adjectival phrases threaten balance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ambitious vision surpasses typical constraints. Buttons serve as ingenious thematic throughlines, though the storm-chasing framework occasionally feels grafted rather than organically developed. Lingering questions about language-as-memory remain productive rather than confusing.</comment>
