<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Characterization is subtle but underdeveloped; her "sapped" state and scientific obsession merge into a generic existential fatigue rather than specific personality. Motivations (perfectionism, disillusionment) feel abstract rather than earned through concrete actions. The samphire’s return barely challenges her stasis, leaving her arc inert.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Structure gains cohesion through cyclical imagery (beginning/end naps) but lacks progression. The goose’s intervention disrupts more than advances the plot’s meditation on futility. Pacing drags in middle paragraphs, creating inertia rather than momentum within the tight word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cliffscape and observatory establish visceral solitude, but sensory texture remains thin—wheezing bellows and crashing waves recur but lack tactile specificity. Setting amplifies alienation yet feels visually repetitive, reliant on oceanic metaphors without distinct materiality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rich metaphors (bellows as mechanized breath, samphire as failed quest) elevate the story. The ending’s circularity and subtext about value in futility resonate, while the prose’s crystalline melancholy (“perfect, pointless sanctuary”) lingers. Emotional states feel shown, not told, though some abstractions dilute impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through idiosyncratic details (mathematical wave precision, “pressed flowers” data). The goose twist subverts expectations subtly, but passages like “fervent indifference” risk self-consciously literary phrasing. Emotional tenor feels human despite occasional purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually (bellows echo tides; goose underscores paradox) but unevenly in practice. Some choices (samphire’s reappearance) dazzle; others (repetitive tide descriptions) feel imposed. The ending’s thematic resonance outweighs structural looseness, offering contemplative, if uneven, literary potential.</comment>
