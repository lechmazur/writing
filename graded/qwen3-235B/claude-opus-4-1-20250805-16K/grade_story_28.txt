<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character's "sly agent" label barely impacts her actions, which focus on archiving rather than subterfuge; motivations tied to preservation are clear but lack nuanced internal conflict beyond surface hopefulness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot hinges on compactly resolving tension between preservation and adaptation; Torres' ceding of the role provides closure but feels slightly accelerated given the high stakes.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Vivid, tactile details (peeling paint, rusted grilles) create a hauntingly resonant setting; decay contrasts with rebirth theme, though atmospheric coherence wavers slightly in dialogue-heavy sections.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Strong synthesis of metaphor (fork as archiving tool, folkloric evolution) and subtext; ending balances emotional payoff with thematic depth about living traditions, though sentimentality occasionally undercuts subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Originality in folklore-as-living-practice concept; avoids clich√©s by focusing on adaptive continuity; language remains crisp but occasionally leans on familiar decay imagery without fully subverting expectations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exquisite cohesion despite tight word count; elements synergize to amplify theme rather than feeling imposed; emotional resonance is genuine but slightly undercut by predictable hopefulness in the conclusion.</comment>
