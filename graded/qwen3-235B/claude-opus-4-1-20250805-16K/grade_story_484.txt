<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Inconsistent motivation; protests vs. supernatural curiosity underdeveloped. Flippant dialogue doesn't fully cohere with reverence for tradition. </comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coherent but compressed arc. Some beats (e.g., descent into cellar) feel rushed. Encroaching darkness as transformation ties together. </comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rich, layered atmosphere with sensory details (darkness like stout, aged kettles). Tension between decay and gentrification enhances world-building. </comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Effective metaphors (yeast/darkness) but ends before exploring deeper themes. Flippant-to-reverent tonal shifts hint at subtext without full realization. </comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh brewing/supernatural parallels subvert hauntings trope. Some phrasing ("aggressive normalcy") risks abstraction. Voice remains distinct but not consistently nuanced. </comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</question><grade>Elements function but some forced connections (mirror shard's warmth). Brevity sacrifices resolution. Lingering potential in gentrification metaphor. </comment>
