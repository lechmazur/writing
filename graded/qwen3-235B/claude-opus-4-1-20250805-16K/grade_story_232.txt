<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Premise-driven motivation overrides human nuance; Marina's obsession lacks psychological complexity despite clear plot logic. The character's voice remains subsumed by atmospheric requirements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clockwork plot mechanics (coffee→inscriptions→realization→abandonment) function efficiently but strain credulity; astronomical coincidence feels contrived despite satisfying resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Visually rich tropical decay and digital-age juxtapositions partially compensate for shallow nomad camp worldbuilding; atmosphere dominates over tactile reality.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical density (unfinished narratives as guardians, coffee grounds as fate texts) elevates material, but emotional weight relies too heavily on thematic concepts versus earned character stakes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</question><comment>Emerges from archetypal framework rather than transcendence; coffee-ground motif avoids cliche but remains conceptually derivative. Certain phrases ("dire enchantment") border on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</question><comment>Tight thematic scaffolding allows element integration despite occasional artificiality; the self-containment of its metaphysical warning creates lingering conceptual resonance despite execution flaws.</comment>
