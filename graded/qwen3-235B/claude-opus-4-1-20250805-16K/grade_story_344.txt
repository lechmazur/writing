<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's claustrophobia and underwater profession's contradiction is mentioned but underexplored. Motivation to study humans through jams is clear but lacks depth in connecting to her personal fears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot flows from entering tea house to tasting jams, but lacks dynamic progression. No clear conflict or rising tension. Static, yet cohesive due to consistent focus on jam-tasting as method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rich sensory details (crystalline waters, tea's dual scent) enhance ethereal atmosphere. Floating tea house's impossibility grounds the narrative, though timeframe phrase feels decorative rather than functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong metaphors (emotion in jams) and layered subtext (claustrophobia vs. open sky) create depth. Ending ties personal journey to universal theme, but emotional resonance is muted by sparse character reactions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Imagery is inventive (jam emotional imprints), but similes like "trembled like autumn leaves" are overused. Tension between logic (study method) and emotion (healing touch) feels somewhat formulaic despite unique premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements work individually but lack narrative synergy. Story succeeds atmospherically but struggles to balance character interiority with concise plotting within short form.</comment>
