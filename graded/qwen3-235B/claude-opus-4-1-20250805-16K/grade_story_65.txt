<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character reactions to death's proximity reveal coping mechanisms through ritual and music, but lacks depth in inner conflict or evolution beyond established trauma.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows cohesively, linking the anniversary ritual to the hourglass reversal, though the backstory reveal feels compressed. Pacing balances mystery and emotional beats within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Evocative sensory details (crystalline acoustics, trembling earth) fuse setting and theme. The tectonic collision symbolizes rupture/renewal, grounding the sacred space's duality with geological authenticity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Music-as-survival metaphor and "thin boundary" subtext resonate strongly. The ending's embrace of imperfection avoids sentimentality, balancing melancholy and defiance through physicality (e.g., rattling doorplate) rather than exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids predictability with fresh metaphors (tears returning to eyes, "slow violent dance"). Avoids overwrought prose; emotional beats shown through generational contrasts rather than direct declarations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sacred geological impermanence and familial resilience create thematic unity. Elements serve the core idea without feeling imposed, though the 17-minute timeframe's significance could be more viscerally tied to the climax.</comment>
