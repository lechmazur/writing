<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's transformation into an artist/archivist is intriguing, but her inner conflict remains underexplored despite clear motivations. Her voice lacks sufficient differentiation from general narration to feel fully realized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot coherence is strong with a tight arc, but the climax with Zhao feels underdeveloped. The action-to-concept relationship is logical but lacks urgency in key transitions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Space debris studio and oil lamp create vivid atmosphere through rich sensory details like "horse-barn memories" and "impossible colors." The settings meaningfully reflect the character's salvaged identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (burning lamp as resurrection of lost senses) and subtext about humanity's amnesia are layered. The ending resonates with thematic completeness through "remembering how to breathe."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Originality shines in combining carnival relics with space salvage, but some phrases ("quietly bold") verge on cliche. Emotional nuance occasionally gives way to poetic generalizations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Story transcends assigned elements to explore existential themes about human connection to history. The synthesis of art, technology, and memory creates lingering impact despite minor pacing quibbles.</comment>
