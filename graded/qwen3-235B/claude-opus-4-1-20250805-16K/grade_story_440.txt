<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kenzo's motivation rooted in paternal devotion and existential purpose is compelling, but his internal conflict between detachment and obsession lacks layered psychological complexity. The swordsman's "loving restraint" is established but understated; his voice remains emotionally muted, which partially obscures deeper characterization.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The plot follows a clean mythopoic arc (discovery → realization → action → transcendence), but the pivotal moment of dimensional穿越 feels underdeveloped. While the collage-to-portal method creates organic momentum, the time constraint flattens the climax into a conceptually rich but dramatically abrupt transition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>New Tokyo's cyberpunk-meets-spiritualism duality has atmospheric promise (holographic film vs organic sea glass), but sensory details remain superficial. The recycling center's machinery operates as thematic backdrop rather than immersive worldbuilding—auditory cues dominate while other senses are neglected.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Evokes haunting melancholy through recursive symbolism (endless collage cycles, daughters becoming Weavers). The juxtaposition of consumer waste with cosmic stakes creates philosophical resonance. The closing image achieves conceptual elegance, though emotional delivery occasionally leans on metaphor-drenched prose rather than earned subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mixes archetypal tropes ("broken warrior," "daughter in peril") with original dimensional theory, but the latter suffers from vague mechanics. Some phrasing ("chopped reality's fabric," "paradox-feeding silk worms") bends toward poetic abstraction at the cost of tangible stakes. The Weavers verge on Lovecraftian clichés without sufficient subversion.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</question><comment>Elements connect through thematic skeleton about creation/destruction cycles, yet uneven execution creates disparity between poetic imagery and narrative logic. The story shines thematically but stumbles technically—its ambition in form (conveyor belt labyrinths, recursive portals) occasionally overwhelms mechanical consistency.</comment>
