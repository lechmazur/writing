<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distinct voice and clear motivation to disrupt order with chaos, but depth of "sassy cook" remains stylistically surface rather than psychologically complex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fracturing reality through chest-opening drives momentum effectively, though the abrupt security team arrival and resolution lack gradual tension escalation within the tight structure.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Baroque, surreal atmosphere (bureaucratic fluorescent-lit multidimensional decay) is vividly sustained; sensory details like interdimensional sauce stains anchor the absurdity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice avoids formulaic transitions; metaphors like "vortex made of equations" subvert expectations. No generic descriptorsâ€”every image advances the story's thematic argument.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere around the anti-bureaucratic rebellion theme, though some (academically mischievous, twilight timeframe) feel decorative rather than essential to the narrative economy.</comment>
