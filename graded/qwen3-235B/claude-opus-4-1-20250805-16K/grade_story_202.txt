<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character's assigned trait ("careful poisoner") shapes actions but lacks emotional depth; motivation driven by instinct feels abstract rather than psychologically grounded. Reactions to the rapier confirm existing traits without revealing new dimensions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Scavenger hunt structure drives plot cleanly but resolution feels abrupt; cause-effect links between clues work logically but emotional payoff remains underdeveloped. Pacing efficient for word count but tension dissipates rather than escalates.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Museum's atmosphere is vividly rendered through tactile details ("barnacle-crusted diving helmet") and conceptual contrast between preserved history and Vera's subversions. Some sensory descriptions lean generic ("dusty starlight"), but tone remains consistent.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors like "poisoner of certainties" and circular structure create thematic resonance. Subtext about constructed narratives adds depth. Ending succeeds as reflective denouement, though emotional engagement remains cerebral rather than visceral.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Skating through museum and "code of instinct" elevate originality. Avoids purple prose but contains a few overwrought lines ("cathedral of lost things"). Avoids tropes through specific historical references but scavenger hunt mechanics follow familiar puzzle-solving frameworks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements fit together logically but feel checklist-adjacent rather than organically integrated. Brevity serves concept but deeper exploration of Vera's philosophy would enhance thematic weight. Ends with conceptual closure but limited emotional resonance.</comment>
