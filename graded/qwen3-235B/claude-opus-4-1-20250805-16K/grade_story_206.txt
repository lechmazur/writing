<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Marisa's vendetta against the regime is tightly woven with her identity as a candy sculptor, creating a unique metaphor for resistance. The emotional transition from vengeance to reclaiming her sister's lost dream feels organic. Motivations are clear but could benefit from more nuanced portrayal of her internal conflict regarding the rebellion. Her precise method of sculpting aligns well with her 'precisely creative' trait but occasionally feels more symbolic than psychologically complex.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The trail of photographs effectively drives the plot toward the hidden continent reveal, maintaining coherence within the tight constraints. Pacing feels rushed in the vault sequence, slightly undermining the emotional weight of discovering the locket. The circularity of beginning/ending with rebellion and transformation is strong, though the abrupt shift from candy-sculptor vengeance to continent quest could use more psychological groundwork. Cause-effect is logical but occasionally prioritizes mystery over character logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ruined market is rendered with exceptional sensory detail (acrid tear gas, fire-gold caramel) that mirrors Marisa's internal state. The rebellion's aftermath permeates every element—the execution posts, crumbling fountain—creating tonal consistency between setting and ardent scorn. The candy-making in a destroyed environment provides rich contrast, though the 'hidden continent' element feels slightly underdeveloped geographically. Timeframe integration of rebellion's effects is strong, but temporal shifts need crisper markers.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Imagery of impermanent sugar sculptures as rebellion masterfully juxtaposes fragility against permanence of resistance. The ending subverts revenge tropes with redemptive action, delivering emotional punch. Subtext about historical erasure is woven through the locket and photographs with precision. Writing avoids cliché through unexpected metaphors (sugar-glass, "ardent scorn for borders"). Minor over-reliance on adjectives like "unmarked" and "forgotten" slightly dilutes impact but doesn't overwhelm the strong core.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of candy-making with revolutionary symbolism avoids genre tropes, though the anonymous kindness trope leans familiar. Emotional nuance in Marisa's transformation is effectively shown through object interactions rather than exposition. Some descriptive passages (e.g., "crystallizing caramel into wings") border on poetic excess but serve thematic purpose. The central conflict between personal vengeance and larger purpose is distinct from algorithmic patterns but could benefit from more idiosyncratic character quirks.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified whole that transcends checklist application. The rebellion setting isn't wasted as mere backdrop—the political context directly shapes every narrative choice. The brevity enhances tension through implication rather than deficiency. The theme of reclaiming erased histories gains resonance through multiple symbolic layers. While not groundbreaking in form, the synthesis of components achieves sophisticated artistic unity with lingering philosophical questions about memory and resistance.</comment>
