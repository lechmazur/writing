<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marina's inherited burden and growth feel organic, but her inner conflict lacks sufficient layers to transcend archetypal "redemption" tropes. The grandmother's backstory could use more emotional complexity to fully justify Marina's actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc from discovery to resolution, but the abrupt shift into the protagonist's acceptance of her legacy feels underdeveloped despite efficient word use in the constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Marina's tactile engagement with the environment—salt air, coral gardens, sewing kit textures—creates immersive specificity that deepens emotional stakes without overwrought description.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyrical yet purposeful prose balances metaphor (e.g., "stitching life into reefs") with emotional subtext. The ending's thematic synthesis of breaking/healing succeeds without melodrama, though character voice occasionally verges on poetic abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tells through original sensory metaphors (e.g., "hollow echoes of shame") and layered motivations. Occasional slightly formulaic phrases ("ache with held breath") are outweighed by fresh imagery in the coral restoration sequences.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>All elements contribute meaningfully to the core intergenerational reckoning theme. The brevity enhances rather than limits the story's emotional scope, though the final transformation could land with more visceral impact.</comment>
