<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Strength: Vera's philosophical annotations and moral evolution through nightmares reveal layered motivation. Weakness: Her abrupt shift from assassin to truth-bringer lacks intermediate emotional steps, undermining psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strength: Tightly compressed arc with clear beginning (key theft)/middle (nightmare transformation)/end (revelation). Weakness: Pacing stumbles in exposition about Secret Keepers; the station's technical functions feel underexplained for such a pivotal setting.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Strength: Eerie atmosphere through technical/mechanical details (electromagnetic pulses, rubber key texture). Weakness: Sensory immersion breaks during dream sequences—burning library lacks tangible details to ground its symbolic weight.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Strength: Profound metaphors (nightmare cycles as spiritual erosion, truth-as-apocalypse) elevate the narrative. Weakness: Vera's final laugh risks melodrama, slightly undercutting the story's philosophical gravity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strength: Avoids dystopian clichés by linking surveillance technology to existential themes. Weakness: "Order of Secret Keepers" borders on generic nomenclasm; Vera's geographical problem-solving feels insufficiently tied to larger themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strength: Elements cohere into a unified meditation on violence vs. truth-telling. Weakness: The frequency station's technological specificity doesn't fully earn its symbolic role as a world-altering device.</comment>
