<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's duality as a chameleon and trauma-channeler is intriguing but under-explored—her agency beyond solving cases lacks visceral emotional grounding. Motivation feels functional rather than deeply human.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pacing within 500 words is masterful—the collapse of performance into revelation maintains momentum. However, the resolution feels rushed; the father twist lacks necessary psychological buildup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Forbidden City's solar-reuse as a theater is visionary, with light/shadow interplay symbolizing truth recovery. Sensory details like "debris-filtered light" create immersive dissonance between dynastic past and post-oil present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Rarely does a story so seamlessly weave metaphor and visceral impact. The doll's dress as both physical artifact and emotional conduit, sunlight as literal/metaphorical truth-seeker, and Maya's "borrowed trauma" motif transcend genre tropes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Largely avoids clichés but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("sun-drunk future"). Emotional nuance in grief portrayal elevates it beyond AI tropes, though some phrasing borders on overwritten.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a thematically unified exploration of memory's physicality. The brevity enhances, rather than hinders, its potency—though the final paragraph risks preciousness.</comment>
