<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Insecurity is central but under-realized; motivation drives the plot yet lacks emotional grounding. Actions align with traits but lack nuanced development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot moves efficiently but stumbles in the dream sequence's rapid shift; arc is implied but feels incomplete within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eerie, sensory-rich setting anchors mood; time-slip transitions and decayed HQ evoke visceral dread, though thematic ties to "fractured idyll" are underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong symbolism (synthetic fluid as a liminal space, echo-footsteps as recursive consciousness) elevates the narrative; theme of doubt-as-a-key resonates but resolution feels telegraphed.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</question><grade></grade><comment>Originality in reversing "fragile genius" tropes, but relies on "haunted HQ" and "brain in a jar" tropes. Avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic boldness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise is cohesive, but some elements (steps-as-motif, fragmented HQ) feel imposed rather than organic. Ending provokes thought but risks vagueness.</comment>
