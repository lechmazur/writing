<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character’s apprehension is stated but underdeveloped; motivation to “rescue truth” is clear but lacks personal stakes or psychological nuance beyond surface traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot adheres to a minimal arc—tension builds through code-utterance climax—but compressed structure leaves some causal connections (e.g., festival backstory) feeling abrupt or underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rich fusion of cyberpunk data-walls and surreal memorial aesthetics creates immersive atmosphere; “borrowed dawn” tone amplifies the story’s melancholic defiance, with minor dissonance between high-tech and whimsical elements.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (e.g., candles as sacrifice) resonate; subtext about historical erasure is poignant. Prose leans into poetic abstraction at times, slightly diluting emotional immediacy through occasional over-reliance on grand imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Avoids overt tropes in its blend of cyberpunk and memory-as-revolution, but some phrasing (“neural death,” “fractured backbone”) risks sounding derivative. Sensory details are vivid though occasionally excessive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ambitious synthesis of elements suggests intent, but uneven tonal cohesion and a somewhat schematic ending (truth “unstoppable and free”) undercut deeper resonance. Lingering questions about the “cycles” are left purposefully vague.</comment>
