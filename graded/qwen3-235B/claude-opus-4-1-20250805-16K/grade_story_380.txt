<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear and tied to actions, but internal complexity could be deeper. The thief's obsession with identity is compelling yet occasionally feels surface-level in emotional exploration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc but strains under word constraints—some causal connections (like sudden thunder) feel rushed despite strong setup.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Eerie, post-apocalyptic atmosphere is evocative (e.g., "windless air," rainfall as redemption), but sensory details remain underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (shifting photos, math as identity erosion) and thematic unity around fractured selfhood are masterful. The ending's transcendence feels earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Originality in framing identity as a mathematical paradox and the dream-theft premise avoids clichés. Subtly rendered emotions avoid explicatory traps.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>All elements synergize tightly. The brevity enhances thematic focus, though the ending’s abstract resolution risks muddying the narrative’s physicality.</comment>
