<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Character's internal conflict is vividly rendered through her crisis of faith and physical interaction with objects, but her transformation feels slightly streamlined, lacking nuanced psychological progression.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot structure is coherent but occasionally meandering, with abrupt shifts in pacing (e.g., sudden realization during migration). The piano decoding sequence feels conceptually dense for the space.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels through hallucinatory sensory details (copper sky, humming glass) that harmonize tone and concept, though the setting's logic occasionally verges on abstraction without deeper contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Storytelling is evocative with fresh metaphors (e.g., "faith's raw form") and thematic resonance. The ending transcends clich√© but could deepen emotional ambiguity through subtext.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Originality evident in fusion of magic and religion, but occasional over-reliance on poetic abstraction ("fractaled whispers") and emotionally schematic moments (e.g., heart cracking "like an egg").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Story cohesively integrates elements with thematic intent, though some (e.g., "capriciously consistent") feel intellectually illustrative rather than organically dramatized. Leaves lingering thematic questions.</comment>
