<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Marina's traits ('skewed visionary,' 'cryptically clear') drive her discoveries but lack emotional depth; motivations are established yet remain surface-level academic curiosity without internal conflict or personal stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot progression through glyph discovery is logical but compressed; connections between botanical sketches and multi-era hieroglyphs strain credibility within tight word limits, though the resolution aligns effectively with the concept.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lab atmosphere contrasts mechanical precision with ancient motifs effectively; sensory details (scents of botanicals, scanner hum) ground the speculative elements without overwhelming them.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (botanicals as temporal maps, pottery as 'invisible infrastructure') offer thematic resonance; ending avoids sentimentality in favor of conceptual clarity, though emotional impact is subdued.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids genre traps but edges toward poetic abstraction (e.g., 'mundane miracles') risking vagueness; metaphors feel deliberately constructed rather than AI-generated, though secondary devices occasionally feel schematic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements function as interdependent gears (botanicals ↔ glyphs ↔ temporal collapse) to explore knowledge preservation; concept cohesion elevates the narrative beyond its slight emotional register.</comment>
