<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivations align with actions, but emotional depth and personal stakes remain underexplored; the doll drives plot more than the character's inherent traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pacing is taut for the word count, with a clear arc; however, the climax feels slightly rushed, reducing the impact of the civilization’s reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visually rich setting with immersive sensory details; the floating district and quantum-preserved sediment deepen the atmosphere, though minor details (e.g., drone dialogue) flirt with cliché.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</comment>
</grade><comment>Layered themes and symbolic connections (Sanskrit/quantum math, ephemeral art/durability) elevate the narrative, though some subtext feels slightly didactic rather than subtly woven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in framing "strength" as invisibility is compelling; avoids overt AI-style repetition, though a few descriptors (e.g., "algae-lit waters") lean generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elegant cohesion under tight constraints; elements like the doll and bio-reactive pigments serve the plot and theme, though the ending’s thematic resonance could deepen further.</comment>
