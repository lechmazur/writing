<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus's transition from spy to escape artist is clear but lacks emotional depth. His "curious indifference" is demonstrated through apathy toward handlers but underserved by subtext. Elena's agency as a fellow spy-turned-infiltrator is compelling, but their dynamic feels transactional rather than intimate, undermining the "lovelorn" premise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Plot momentum from avalanche to hidden kitchen lacks logical beats in the collapse sequence. The coordinates-on-a-label conceit drives action effectively, but the descent into the underground restaurant feels narratively abrupt despite elegant thematic payoff. The arc is complete but compressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Neo-Singapore slums are vividly realized through rust-bleeding chrome and olfactory details like "fragrant steam." The metallic setting supports the "unfamiliar reflections" motif, though the multiverse implication of Elena's face remains unexplored. Immersion is strong but unevenly layered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The metaphor of "sheds like the building above" crystallizes the theme of metamorphosis. Dialogue ("You're late") feels authentic to their dynamic. The ending's transcendence of "spy and mark" roles elevates it, though the "rambling destiny" subtext is underdeveloped despite strong imagery.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids dystopian tropes through kitchen-as-espionage concept and transformed protagonists. The encrypted recipe mechanism is inventive but borders on gimmick. Emotional beats like Marcus's "meticuous indifference" are shown through action rather than stated, though some descriptors ("curiously indifferent") feel conceptually forced.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fits all assigned elements without obvious seams. The brevity works thematically but sacrifices deeper exploration of Marcus's psyche. The fusion of culinary espionage and urban decay feels original, though the ending's transcendence lacks visceral impact despite its conceptual boldness.</comment>
