<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character motivations lack emotional complexity; Morthis acts primarily as a plot device for revelation rather than a fully realized individual. The trope of the nervous necromancer remains surface-level.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within word count, but pacing feels compressed during climax. The decoded mural's societal impact occurs abruptly, lacking necessary build-up between revelation and mass uprising.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mastery of sensory details creates immersive retro-digital atmosphere. The visual contrast between "blocky shadows" and "corrupted save files" uniquely fuses horror and nostalgia, with sound descriptions (echoing code) enhancing tension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong use of symbolism (wholesale data absorption as metaphor for authoritarianism) and irony (divine deception). The ending effectively shows power dissolution through collective awareness, though emotional impact remains somewhat conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Subverts genre expectations through pixel necromancy as data archaeology. Avoids clich√©s with specific technical terminology and innovative metaphors (code as teeth) rather than generic fantasy elements. Tone remains consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements form a cohesive conceptual framework despite limited space. Some structural compression sacrifices emotional weight, but the story's cyberpunk parable remains intellectually resonant beyond its brevity.</comment>
