<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character is driven but shallowly realized; motivations are clear (exonerating family legacy) but lack psychological nuance. Interactions with drone/ticket stubs show determination but little emotional vulnerability or complexity. Dialogue reduced to texts undermines human connection, limiting deeper development.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot moves coherently from discovery of stubs to revelation of conspiracy. Tight pacing within word limit; match-light finale connects to theme effectively. Some underdeveloped threads (Sarah's role, drone's origin) don't disrupt momentum. Clear three-act structure despite brevity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Combustion lab's charred remains and hummingbird's mechanical glow create vivid atmosphere. Evocative sensory details (match's burn, drone's hum) enhance mood. Timeframe between texts adds urgency but underutilized as spatial/temporal constraint. Period details (grandfather's death) deepen setting.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Impact derives from layered symbolism: combustion as truth-revelation, stubs as evidence of erased ethics. Subtext about archival erasure and technological memory resonates. Ending's thematic fusion of destruction/clarification avoids melodrama. "Scheduled tours" motif richly suggestive.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality in linking nobility to combustion research; avoids clich√©d phoenix metaphors. Writing style precise without floridity; emotional subtext shown through documentation. Minimal AI-like phrasing; however, "hollow recklessness" borders on aestheticized suffering. Tension between organic/systemic truth is innovative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elements coherently integrated: aristocratic identity informs obsession, drone enables investigation, stubs drive both plot and theme. Constraints serve narrative purpose (ticket stubs as physical text fragments mirror digital texts). Ending achieves thematic resolution without over-explanation. Lingering questions about broader conspiracy enhance ambiguity.</comment>
