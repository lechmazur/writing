<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear and consistent, driving Marcus's actions with distinct voice, but emotional depth feels surface-level despite his obsession with the supernatural. Nuances of his internal conflict could be more visceral.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tension between scientific rigor and metaphysical possibility propels the plot effectively. The resolution feels abrupt but thematically resonant. Pacing balances urgency with introspection within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vividly realized worldbuilding—fiber-optic marble, quantum sensors, and a bio-organic ghost—creates an immersive tone. Sensory details like the physical cold and scattered threads deepen immersion. Only minor quibbles with underdeveloped Roman architectural specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (threads as neural pathways, "technically organic" duality) enrich subtext. The ending transcends genre tropes to deliver emotional resonance. Dialogue is spare but purposeful; theme of connection lingers post-reading.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi and ghost story tropes with moderate originality. The "bio-organic consciousness" avoids cliche but occasionally relies on familiar emotional beats ("grateful smile bridging millennia"). Language remains purposeful but occasionally edges toward ornate description.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements are tightly woven into theme and plot; the story’s brevity feels intentional. The concept’s conceptual ambition sometimes outpaces its emotional nuance, but overall execution demonstrates inventiveness.</comment>
