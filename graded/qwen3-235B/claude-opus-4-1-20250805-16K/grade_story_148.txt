<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Limited space constrains full emotional depth; conflict between scientific rigor and inherited legacy is clear but underdeveloped. The "eagerly unwilling" duality lacks visceral manifestation in later choices.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Effective use of time compression; transitions between past/present knowledge feel slightly expedited. Climactic resolution feels purposeful, though carousel's technical workings are under-explained. Pacing mostly balanced within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Strong sensory contrast between desert and mountains established through climate-focused details. Tapestries as weather archives cleverly tie setting to concept, but monastery's cultural/spiritual dimension remains underutilized.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mix of scientific terminology and poetic metaphor creates distinctive voice. Emotional payoff of inherited legacy works thematically, though some technical explanations verge on expositional. Symbolic parallels (tongs as lightning rod) resonate effectively.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avoids predictable storm-chasing clich√©s by merging meteorology with textile archaeology. Emotional subtext shown through tactile object interactions (tongs, threads) rather than blunt telling. Occasional overly-ornate phrases ("trapped lightning") slightly undercut authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elaborate contrivance of tapestry-based weather machine strains credulity slightly, but thematic cohesion between character expertise and inherited machinery compensates. Tight integration of elements suggests deliberate craftsmanship exceeding typical anthology filler.</comment>
