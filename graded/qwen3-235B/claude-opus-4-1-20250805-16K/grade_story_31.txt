<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Characters are effectively sketched with distinct traits and motivations, but their development feels abbreviated. Kai's internal conflict as a displaced worker and Mika's overlooked status are hinted at but inadequately excavated in the limited space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progression is functional but lacks tension – the key introduces momentum, but the journey downward occurs too swiftly. The cyclical structure (rooftop→greenhouse→return) is implied but not fully realized due to pacing constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Visually arresting with cyberpunk specifics (synthetic blossoms, chrome arteries), but emotional layers of decay vs. regrowth could be amplified. Sensory details are vivid but unevenly distributed, privileging visuals over other senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Combines mechanical precision with organic metaphor through biodegradable paint/x-outs, uses Mika's certainty to subvert passive victim tropes. Ending delivers thematic cohesion through physical and emotional connectivity between characters.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids excessive ornamentation while maintaining poetic economy. Metaphors (weeds through chrome, x-ing as mourning) feel fresh. No mechanical phrasing or awkward transitions, though Mika's parentage as manager feels schematic rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rigidly adheres to assignment parameters while maintaining emotional credibility. The brevity enhances the haunting sense of vertical isolation, though the climax risks being diminished by compressed real estate requirements.</comment>
