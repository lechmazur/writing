<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character motivation exists but lacks nuanced psychological depth; actions align with traits but feel more archetypal than fully realized.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but feels compressed; transitions between key moments (e.g., mixing blood and ash) occur abruptly without sufficient contextual grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive sensory details (volcanic glass maps, earthy ink) strongly support the mystical atmosphere and thematic tension between past and present.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphors layer effectively (e.g., tattoos as songlines), and the ending subverts literal map-quest tropes by making the lost city a metaphysical state, though emotional stakes remain abstract.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Originality in reimagining tradition as evolutionary rather than static; however, phrases like "ink pulsed with earthen power" occasionally border on ornamental abstraction.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elements merge cohesively enough for a thematic throughline, but some forced connections (e.g., lava shop's decorative ash) suggest deliberate worldbuilding scaffolding.</comment>
