<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Characters serve symbolic roles effectively but lack nuanced inner complexity; motivations align with assigned elements but feel archetypal rather than deeply individuated</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong central metaphor drives momentum but compressed arc leaves some emotional beats underdeveloped; cause-effect of transformation feels slightly underweighted</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elements combine into cohesive philosophical parable; tighter execution of character interiority would enhance emotional weight within constraints</comment>
