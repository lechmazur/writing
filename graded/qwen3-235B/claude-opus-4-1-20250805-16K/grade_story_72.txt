<question>1</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Character transformation lacks emotional depth; motivations shift abruptly without sufficient groundwork despite the sneer establishing initial arrogance. Reactions to the stellar concept feel underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot arc is coherent but rushed; cause-effect logic holds for most, though the shift from skepticism to transcendence feels abrupt within the tight word limits. Some narrative gaps remain.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mesmerizing sensory details immerse readers, but the alien setting occasionally overwhelms character engagement. Timeframe phrasing feels abstract, slightly diluting atmospheric cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking metaphors (e.g., "rambling destiny," "cyclones that never touch the ground") evoke thought. Ending resonates thematically, though emotional resonance relies heavily on implied awe over tangible character shifts.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Generally avoids clich√©s, with stellar bioengineering concept feeling original. Occasional purple prose ("borrowed radiance," "furious tranquility") threatens clarity but doesn't overshadow fresh subversion of agricultural fantasy tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements integrate tightly, though the brevity strains resolution. The thematic blend of evolution and cosmic transcendence lingers effectively, suggesting intentional compression rather than constraint.</comment>
