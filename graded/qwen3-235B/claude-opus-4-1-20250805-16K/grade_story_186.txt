<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot structure is crisp and purposeful within constraints, though the moment of thematic resolution relies too heavily on the miner's immediate epiphany without sufficient psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding excels with specific sensory details that ground the reader, though the setting’s potential isn’t fully exploited narratively in terms of conflict or character stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Story successfully blends metaphor and subtext, with an ending that resonates thematically; however, some emotional beats rely on exposition rather than earned empathy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through inventive concept, but stumbles with occasionally generic descriptors (e.g., “whimsical,” “bioluminescent fungi”) and slightly mechanical transitions between worldbuilding and plot.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Purposefully concise, with elements contributing to theme without redundancy; the story’s ambition occasionally outpaces its ability to realize its themes fully.</comment>
