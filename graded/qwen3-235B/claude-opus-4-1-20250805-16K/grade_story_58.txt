<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Scout Vera's loyalty and trauma are present but lack nuanced exploration; her motivations are clear but not deeply layered, and her voice lacks distinctive personality despite the first-person framing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Plot achieves closure through Vera's emotional stillness mirroring the city's power return, but pacing stumbles in compressing character evolution; comedic code's significance emerges abruptly.</comment>
