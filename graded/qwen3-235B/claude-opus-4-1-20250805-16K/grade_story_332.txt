<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Focused motivation drives action, but character voice lacks full differentiation from narrative prose; emotional depth implied through actions but interiority remains constrained.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compact arc achieved through memory layering; pacing falters slightly during exposition-heavy confession explanation, but circular structure with emotional closure elevates coherence.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Exo-atmospheric elements create vivid, sensory-driven atmosphere; vacuum-grown orchids and starlight interplay build immersive contrast between isolation and legacy.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Layered subtext about memory-as-ecosystem; closing image of hybrid human/plant legacy achieves poignant resonance through restrained, evocative imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unique premise undermined by occasional overused phrasing ("intimate separation," "leap of faith"); plant-embedded memories risk novelty over nuance despite strong central metaphor.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</question><grade>Combines speculative and emotional elements with purposeful tension; brief format enhances ethereal quality rather than limiting thematic depth.</grade>
