<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Marina's detachment is consistent but underdeveloped; her zaniness exists as concept more than embodied behavior. Motivations hinted at through actions but lack emotional texture or contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Plot exists only as atmospheric vignette; no conflict/resolution. Repetitive vignettes of call log integration lack momentum despite strong imagery. Form doesn't serve traditional narrative structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Visually evocative with tactile details of broken technology, but time-folding remains decorative rather than structural. Auditory elements (call fragments) create haunting mood but feel under-orchestrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stylistic brilliance in metaphors ("DNA of impossible machines") and cyclical structure, though emotional resonance remains intellectualized. Theme of impermanence gains depth through juxtaposition rather than character engagement.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Avoids cliche in mixing eras and deconstructing "mad inventor" trope. Some overwritten phrases ("chronology's shores") and underexplored temporal logic prevent perfect originality score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Successfully unifies elements into cohesive concept but fails to justify short fiction form through lack of narrative stakes. Lingers intellectually but lacks narrative necessity.</comment>
