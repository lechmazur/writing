<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivation (seeking emotional understanding over facts) is clear but could use more backstory to ground her transformation. Voice remains consistent but lacks distinct personality beyond stated traits.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear arc but pacing feels rushed in establishing emotional stakes. Cause/effect between heartbreak and visions lacks transitional nuance. Word limit strains spatial-temporal logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>World-building shines with evocative imagery ("fracturing walls," "honey-lightning-stillness time"). Sensory details (compass warmth, dissolving words) immerse readers but occasionally verge on abstract over-saturation.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Metaphors (compass as emotional guide) and layered themes of knowledge vs. empathy resonate powerfully. Ending delivers satisfying thematic resolution through action rather than exposition. Over-reliance on abstractions in emotional beats slightly weakens impact.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strikes original ground by literalizing emotional landscapes. Avoids clich√©s through visceral sensory metaphors but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("whispered minute") that risks distancing readers from core themes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Elements combine cohesively into a metaphor-rich narrative, though some constructs (e.g., time manipulation) feel more like decorative flourishes than structurally necessary. Leaves intellectual and emotional residue but struggles with narrative economy.</comment>
