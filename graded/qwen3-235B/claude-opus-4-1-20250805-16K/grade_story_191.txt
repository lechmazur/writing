<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Character is defined by surface traits (sober cardsharp, grudging admiration) without deeper exploration of his internal conflict or redemption arc; motivation is implied but not emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Plot follows a logical progression but relies on vague mechanics (e.g., "hurried between heartbeats") without clear rules or escalation; cohesive but sacrifices depth to compress narrative scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exquisite sensory immersion via aggressive silence, mist-shrouded atmosphere, and ink's moonlit texture; setting actively shapes the uncanny tone and Marcus's method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Metaphors ("coffee perpetually cooling") and ink's symbolism are evocative, but emotional impact is diluted by abstract resolutions; theme of liminality is compelling yet underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Avant-garde dream logic and inverted detective work feel human-written and inventive; some ornate phrasing risks pretension, but the voice avoids formulaic AI patterns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements are interwoven with ambition but uneven in execution; the metaphor-heavy style occasionally prioritizes aesthetics over narrative clarity, yet it lingers conceptually.</comment>
