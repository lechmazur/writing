<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Character's guilt is consistently portrayed through tactile interactions with objects, but lacks deeper exploration of her past trauma; motivations are clear but narrowly focused on redemption.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from catalyst to resolution within tight space, but the mask's transformation into a portal lacks sufficient foreshadowing for full emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vibrant contrast between neon shop's artificial hum and ancient mask's primal energy creates haunting atmosphere; sensory details like dissolving mask light elevate immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (mask as self-confrontation, neon as purgatory) resonate; ending avoids easy redemption tropes by framing guilt as transformative companion; emotional arc feels earned.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original fusion of cyberpunk and myth avoids genre clich√©s; language occasionally trends purple ("mellow intensity," "midnight tears") but mostly balances poetic precision with clarity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements organically intertwine (mask informs character, neon shop shapes atmosphere); brevity feels purposeful; leaves readers contemplating guilt's transmutation.</comment>
