<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character motivation (decoding cipher) is clear but underdeveloped—personality beyond her role as alchemist and mother remains surface-level. Coin use reveals determination but lacks deeper psychological complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from coin discovery to swarm/family project coincidences, building toward symbolic epiphany. Rushed final act (watchtowers/tar pit resolution) slightly disrupts pacing.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Suburban alchemy creates intriguing juxtaposition. Some vivid details (bubbling tar, terrarium butterfly) but atmospheric depth sacrificed for pacing; suburban setting could be more actively immersive.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (coin as seed, bees as living map) elevate material. Ending’s thematic synthesis of family/transmutation resonates emotionally despite slight predictability in “guardians of nature” motif.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Avoids formulaic tropes via specific details (petunia spirals as ancestral patterns, cell tower watchtowers). Kinship web concept remains mostly surface-level but feels organic rather than clichéd.</comment>
