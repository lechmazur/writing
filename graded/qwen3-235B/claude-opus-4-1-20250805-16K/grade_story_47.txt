<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Seventeen's eagerness and jadedness shape her arc, but Marta's motivation falters in execution; her "too alive" rejection lacks thematic payoff. The glove's reveal as a symbolic hand-covering device feels underexplored despite strong core duality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The plot pivots cleanly around stolen phones and fragmented clues, but the transition to Ward Nine feels slightly contrived. The 500-word arc resolves too neatly for a "too alive" twist, sacrificing eerie ambiguity for a cathartic punchline.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silent monastery amplifies tension and subversion—the abrupt laughter payoff contrasts effectively. Sensory details (glove texture, disembodied whispers) crystallize the dissonance between death's dignity and absurdity, though the digital afterlife angle risks overreach.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Stylistically inventive, with metaphors ("ceiling has no corners when horizontal") that mirror the theme. The ending's laughter-as-defiance resonates as both cathartic and unsettling, though some phrases ("babies of dark comedy") teeter toward pretension.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice notes avoid cliché absurdity by grounding emotion in technology. No formulaic dialogue or flat clichés—Marta's "death's punchline" line subverts elegy tropes—but the glove's connection to skin/unmarked flesh borders on overexplained.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elements fuse seamlessly: silence births laughter; gloves mark legacy; stolen phones weaponize memory. The twist avoids gimmickry by aligning every element (e.g., eager jadedness reflecting both ward's roles). Too tidy? Perhaps—but the thematic unity justifies it.</comment>
