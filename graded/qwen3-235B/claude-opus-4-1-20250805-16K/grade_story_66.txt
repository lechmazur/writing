<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character is introspective and thematically aligned, but motivations are more implied than deeply felt, relying on poetic abstraction over psychological nuance. Internal conflicts remain somewhat generalized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot achieves emotional arc through symbolic progression, but the sudden transition to "carbonize" her ID lacks sufficient buildup; tight word constraints cause rushed emotional payoff despite strong thematic cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Visceral sensory details (ceramic tears, smoke, electromagnetic whispers) establish haunting atmosphere; the derelict facility’s decay and symbiotic plant life create compelling tension between human fragility and botanical endurance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elegiac tone and metaphor-heavy prose elevate the narrative, but occasionally veer into overwrought lyricism. The central theme of belonging through dissolution resonates, though some imagery (e.g., "carbonize the soul") risks thematic overstatement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subverts "deserter" trope by intertwining human breakdown with botanical sentience. The porcelain mask reconstruction and plant elegies demonstrate inventive synthesis of elements. Avoids AI-like patterns through emotionally grounded surrealism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements weave into a thematically unified whole—the desolation, reconstruction of fractured identities, and botanical sentience create lingering resonance. Narrative brevity feels purposeful, though sacrifices some character depth.</comment>
