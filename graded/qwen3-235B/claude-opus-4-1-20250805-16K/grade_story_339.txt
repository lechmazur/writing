<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marina's guilt-driven struggle is clear and human, though her voice lacks distinctiveness; her actions align with motivation but depth is slightly undercut by underdeveloped emotional nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Structure is tight with circularity between past/present, but the word limit creates slight narrative compression in the confession's resolution; pacing mostly effective despite a few rushed beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral with oil-rainbow imagery and phantom sounds; the constructed decay directly mirrors Marina's psyche, though the "prismatic" setting's symbolic potential isn't fully exhausted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Potent use of metaphor (lake reflections, phantom rhythms) and layered subtext about performance vs. truth; emotional resonance emerges through restrained physical gestures rather than stated feelings.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with unique details (e.g., corporate event performances), though some phrases ("radiant entertainer") border on generic; emotional arc feels earned rather than formulaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elements serve thematic cohesion—guilt, truth-seeking, and entropy—but the seesaw/setting integration could be tighter; ending lingers with moral weight rather than neat closure.</comment>
