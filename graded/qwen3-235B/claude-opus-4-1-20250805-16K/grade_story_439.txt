<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's muteness is central to plot function but lacks emotional depth; motivation inferred through action rather than layered internalization; gestures convey competence but not inner conflict; silent presence is evocative yet remains impressionistic rather than fully dimensional.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear progression but resolution feels perfunctory; celestial timing and liminal space mechanics are coherent yet under-explained; tension dissipates during climax due to compressed scale; concept's fantastical elements require greater narrative scaffolding to satisfy structural rigor.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is visceral and cohesiveâ€”storm, decay, and cold create immersive tension; celestial phenomena contrast mortal ruin effectively; sensory details anchor surrealism in tangible reality; setting itself functions as a haunting co-character.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Imagery of silent transcendence resonates, but emotional impact diluted by exposition; metaphoric threads (e.g., stardust dissolution) feel conceptually thin; writing style is lyrical but occasionally prioritizes description over thematic heft; concluding epiphany lacks earned profundity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elevates genre tropes through tactile details (snow's directionality in portals) and conceptual fusion of muteness with non-verbal interdimensional language; avoids overused "chosen one" framing, yet relies on familiar liminal space mysticism without deep subversion; language remains disciplined against purple prose.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elements function synergistically with minimal contrivance; brevity feels intentional yet thematic reach exceeds psychological complexity; closing image of ascending into inverted reality lingers but raises unexplored questions about erasure vs transformation; polished but slightly weightless.</comment>
