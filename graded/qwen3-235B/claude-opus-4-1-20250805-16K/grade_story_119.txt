<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Character motivation (compassion vs. survival instinct) is clear but thinly developed; Marcus' internal conflict lacks depth despite critical decisions; assigned attribute "sometimes always" is confusing and inconsistently applied to his actions; dialogue lacks distinctive voice but serves functional purpose</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Plot follows compressed escape narrative effectively; revelation-to-chase structure is logical and propulsive; transitions between Marcus' realization and group flight are smooth but slightly rushed in timeframe-constrained midsection; cause-effect ties between key's function and hunters' appearance feel artificial despite surface coherence</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival creates strong visual atmosphere but underutilized sensory environment; shadow mapping adds clever spatial magic system; tonal contrast between decaying setting and astral elements works well but lacks olfactory/tactile detail; time compression prevents full setting immersion</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphorical use of shadows as maps and guidance systems elevates genre elements; theme of intergenerational survival knowledge gives conceptual weight; ending sacrifices character resolution for thematic reinforcement; "showing vs telling" balanced but occasionally heavy-handed in exposition about key's purpose</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Story avoids generic fantasy tropes through specific execution (shadow choreography) but contains predictable hero archetype beats; phrase "sometimes always" feels artificial; emotional resonance relies on generalized sacrifice tropes rather than nuanced reactions; atmospheric elements contain fresh imagery but occasionally cross into purple prose</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</genre><comment>Successfully integrates most elements but prioritizes plot mechanics over character depth; constrained format forces thematic compression that both enriches and limits; tone blending pragmatism with mysticism remains consistently executed; brief length emphasizes momentum over reflection</comment>
