<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's motivation is clear but lacks nuance; his obsession with quantifying faith drives actions, but internal conflict is stated rather than shown through layered behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Plot flows logically toward a thematic resolution, but the 400-word limit creates compressed pacing that leaves the experiment's implications underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Visually immersive setting merges surrealism with scientific inquiry; the subterranean dog park's eerie atmosphere mirrors the protagonist's liminal existence between faith and reason.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors intertwine with thematic resonance, particularly in the ripple patterns symbolizing existential duality. Ending feels abrupt but thematically coherent; tension between science/faith is palpable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic writing through poetic precision, but occasional adverb-heavy phrasing ("trembling against," "exultant grief") borders on dramaturgical excess.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements coalesce into a thematically unified whole; brevity enhances its haunting quality as the pond's equations suggest infinite narrative potential beyond the confines of the text.</comment>
