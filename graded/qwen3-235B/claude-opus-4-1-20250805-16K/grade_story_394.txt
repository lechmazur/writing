<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's paradoxical traits are present but underexplored; motivation is hinted at through action but lacks emotional depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot arc is clear but compressed; some cause-effect connections feel underdeveloped (e.g., airplane's "knowledge flood").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements cohere conceptually, but tone fluctuations and explanatory shortcuts weaken their synergy.</comment>
