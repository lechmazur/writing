<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Marcel's gruff demeanor and history with the coins/agent are established but underdeveloped. His motivation to "out-face old ghosts" lacks emotional depth, though his detached dialogue provides a distinct voice.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Story follows a circular arc but feels compressed. The shadow-pattern method drives action logically, and the agent's arrival/departure form a coherent sequence. Pacing is tight, but stakes and history between Marcel and "old ghosts" remain under-explored within the limited word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The setting's duality (tourist surface vs. spy tunnels) creates intrigue, and shadows-as-language imagery grounds the locale. However, sensory details (cobblestones, metallic sounds) are sparse and inconsistently used to immerse readers in the atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong metaphors ("weight of scars," crypto-wish) suggest themes of lost futures and eroded humanity. The ending achieves thematic resonance but leans on vague "ghost" test conceit instead of fully exploiting subtext about complicity in secrecy.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blends Cold War and digital-age paranoia with originality, but relies on familiar "cynical guardian" tropes. Sensory details occasionally border on overwrought ("patterns he'd memorized like a language"), and emotional nuance often gets stated ("disgrunted") rather than shown.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Integrates assigned elements cohesively—esp. coins and crypto as through-line—but leaves some (shadow patterns) underutilized. The brief format serves the story's enigmatic tone but limits deeper exploration of character and theme.</comment>
