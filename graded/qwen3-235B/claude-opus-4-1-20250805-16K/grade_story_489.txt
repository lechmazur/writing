<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to reclaim tradition is clear, but the "aggressively kind" observer remains underdeveloped, reducing emotional engagement and creating narrative imbalance. Marina's voice lacks psychological complexity beyond symbolic gestures.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is competent but predictable—ritual's culmination feels inevitable rather than earned. Pacing is uneven; the sudden whale response and observer's dissolution create tonal dissonance within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Haunting permeates effectively through sensory details (salt memory, cold spots), but the "haunted lighthouse" concept leans on Gothic shorthand rather than unique reinvention, diluting atmospheric distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors ("lighthouse beam made flesh") elevate impact, but overt thematic statements ("wisdom wears the disguise of simple things") undercut subtext. Ending resolution sacrifices nuance for symbolism.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Poetic descriptions sometimes verge on self-indulgence, yet the plastic whistle's symbolic weight and whale connection avoid pure formula. Character reactions rely too heavily on lyrical abstraction over relatable human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The story succeeds as mood piece but falters structurally. Assigned elements are occasionally forced—timeframe/motivation strain cohesion despite moments of lyrical strength creating lingering resonance.</comment>
