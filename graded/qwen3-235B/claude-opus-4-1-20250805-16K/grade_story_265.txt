<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chen's impassive persona contrasts with his emotional investment in the cathedral, but his internal conflict between duty and personal obsession remains underexplored. The grandfather's beekeeping lessons feel like a tacked-on explanation rather than a motivation organically tied to his character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Predictable trajectory from clues to mystical revelation lacks narrative tension. The three twist-tie clues create a mechanical plot progression, while the resolution feels narratively complete but emotionally flat. Pacing works within the constraints but leaves conceptual gaps in the supernatural elements.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cathedral's impossible apple orchard has atmospheric potential through vivid imagery (humming fruit, upward-falling petals), but the tone shifts uneasily between procedural thriller and mystical fantasy. The sensory details feel overstuffed rather than cohesive, creating an inconsistent metaphysical reality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Striking metaphors ("golden stars" of bees) and symbolic apple tree evoke themes of transcendent truth. The ending's thematic convergence on grace works effectively, though the narrative leans on poetic description rather than earned emotional authenticity. The conflict between control and surrender resonates beneath the surface.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The bee language clue system shows ingenuity within a familiar "hidden messages" trope. The cathedral setting avoids full clich√© through biological surrealism rather than supernatural tropes. However, the "trapped in another dimension" resolution defaults to a genre convention without providing a fresh paradigm for the story's unique worldbuilding elements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core mystery framework holds despite the fantastical elements. The cathedral setting works as both plot device and thematic space, but some connections between oil change ritual and beekeeping heritage feel imposed rather than naturally integrated within the story's compact structure.</comment>
