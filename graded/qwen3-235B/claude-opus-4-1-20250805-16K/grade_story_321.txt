<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character has clear emotional arc but lacks nuanced internal conflict in early stages; motivations tied to guilt and redemption are consistent but revealed through predictable symbols rather than subtle behavioral cues.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear redemption arc with cause-effect logic (guilt -> realization -> transformation), but the rapid transition from stasis to resolution feels slightly rushed despite tight word constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (heat, smoke, hourglass) create atmosphere but worldbuilding remains superficial; setting’s connection to thematic punishment feels underexplored beyond superficial Hell tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Superb use of metaphor (ribbon, hourglass) and symbolic action; emotional impact heightened by restrained dialogue and haunting sensory contrasts, though theme statement feels slightly over-explained in final lines.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elevates familiar guilt/redemption framework with original metaphors and psychological insight; language occasionally verges on poetic abstraction but avoids overt clichés through specific, character-driven emotional revelations.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Masterful synthesis of elements into cohesive thematic statement; each assigned component serves character development while maintaining narrative economy; leaves a lingering existential resonance about self-forgiveness.</comment>
