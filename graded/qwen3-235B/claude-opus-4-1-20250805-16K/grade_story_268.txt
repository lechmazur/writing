<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but overly deterministic; trauma-as-backstory feels formulaic. The wooden bead as inherited burden offers some depth, but the vigilante archetype lacks psychological complexity beyond surface-level revenge tropes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Plot momentum stutters between introspective passages and procedural details. Virtual call structure provides scaffolding, but the story’s tight word limit exposes underdeveloped cause-effect between mirror revelations and final decision. Pacing uneven in key transitions.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Abandoned hospital’s decay and mirror’s circus motifs create haunting visual motif. Sensory details (blue shadows, clicking bead) enhance mood without overloading. Timeframe’s virtual calls contrast ghostly setting, though atmospheric potential underutilized beyond surface symbolism.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Metaphor of distorted reflections as truth-seeking device offers conceptual resonance. Ending’s thematic link between war and justice is effective but telegraphed. Dialogue minimal yet functional; emotional subtext outweighs explicit sentiment. Central conflict remains static within constraints.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids AI clichés through specific historical layers (last war, grandmother’s role). “Artfully clumsy” vigilante technique subverts action tropes, though “ancient art of pattern-reading” risks mysticism vagueness. Writing style generally precise but occasionally lapses into familiar war narrative abstractions.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements integrated with craftsmanship but not transcendent cohesion. Mirror device and setting elevate premise beyond genre tropes; bead and silence motif add texture but lack narrative necessity. Lingering impact resides in thematic concept rather than fully realized execution.</comment>
