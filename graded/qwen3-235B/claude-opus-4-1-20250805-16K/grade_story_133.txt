<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weakly developed jadedness; grandmother's legacy feels underexplored, but subtle physical details (gloves, brushstrokes) hint at buried motivation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from discovery to ritual, but ceremonial dance resolution feels abrupt; pottery class setup lacks emotional weight despite thematic payoff at throne.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Labyrinth orchard's gothic colonial decay is visceral; twilight's "purple shadows" and living-tree throne create haunting cohesion; timeframe shifts between memories and present need clearer anchoring.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors (embroidery as ritual maps, twilight as tradition's resurgence) elevate beyond Gothic fantasy tropes; ending avoids melodrama while implying societal oblivion to resurgence.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Original integration of colonial decay and forgotten rituals avoids formula; some adjectives ("delightfully menacing") border on indulgent, but tactile details (plaster keyhole reveal) feel human-scaled.</comment>
