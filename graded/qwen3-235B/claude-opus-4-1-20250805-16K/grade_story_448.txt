<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara's distrust and rebelliously docile facade are established but underexplored; motivations for preserving histories are implied through actions rather than dramatized, with limited interiority despite the first-person-seeming prose.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot follows a taut, deliberate arc with clear stakes and resolution; pacing compresses effectively but lacks complexity in cause-and-effect connections between soot alchemy mechanics and narrative consequences.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Industrial setting and magical elements coexist inventively, but sensory immersion is unevenâ€”smells/texture emphasized while auditory/thermal details could deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Stunning synthesis of metaphor (soot as erased memory) and subtext (silenced histories); ending resonates thematically through action rather than exposition, with precise symbolic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Economical, purposeful prose with occasional ornamental excess ("humblest materials to capture what the powerful sought to erase"); subversion of "innocuous observer" tropes feels genuine rather than formulaic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tight integration of assigned elements into cohesive whole; each component serves multiple narrative functions while maintaining economy of language and conceptual daring.</comment>
