<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's grief and guilt are palpable, but her internal transformation feels occasionally schematic, relying on symbolic gestures (like the rifle shots) over nuanced emotional layers. Her voice is distinct, but her brother's ghost urging her to live lacks sufficient development beyond plot function.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story's arc—confronting the past through ritual reenactments—is clear, but the pivotal shift from stagnation to acceptance occurs too cleanly, undercutting the complexity of grief. The letter structure provides cohesion, yet the rifle's symbolic use strains under brevity's weight.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The carnival's decay—the peeling targets, amber-lit dust motes, and rusted machinery—creates a tactile, haunting atmosphere that mirrors Marina's emotional state. Sensory details (gunpowder, condensation on ink) seamlessly blend setting and inner conflict, elevating both mood and motif.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (amber, rifle) resonate emotionally, and the ending avoids sentimentality. However, some lines ("frozen heart") lean on abstraction rather than earned subtext. The theme of liberation through surrender is clear but could risk melodrama without the precise tactile language.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The narrative avoids overt clichés (ghosts as literal guides) by making the dead a chorus, not a plot device. However, phrases like "slow, painful thaw" verge on cliché, and the story occasionally over-explains Marina's epiphany rather than letting atmosphere imply it.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story transcends its elements by weaving them into a cohesive metaphor for mourning. The compact form occasionally strains the emotional arc, but the closing image—a warmed, thawing heart—leaves a potent, lingering contrast between stasis and renewal.</comment>
