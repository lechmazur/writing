<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Character is consistently indifferent, but lacks depth in motivation beyond archetypal "sacrifice for duty." No interiority to contextualize emotional numbness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically through ritualistic progression, but the abrupt ascension of rubble and open-ended resolution undermine closure within tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Evocative but unbalanced sensory details (cold, silence, crumbling stone) create immersive atmosphere; cathedral bells as time marker under-exploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Potent symbolism in objects-as-residue-of-life; emotional detachment sabotages catharsis. Ending lacks thematic payoff despite lyrical prose.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Original in premise but occasionally lapses into gothic clich√©s ("stone lungs," "terrible knowledge"). Some overwrought metaphors dilute authenticity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elements cohere but prioritize aesthetic cohesion over emotional urgency. Lingers thematically but lacks visceral impact.</comment>
