<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant trait (apathy) is consistent but underdeveloped in family members who feel symbolic rather than fully realized. Milo's motivation emerges subtly through actions but lacks emotional progression until the ending revelation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pacing struggles under tight word count - the climactic realization feels abrupt despite effective use of illumination as plot mechanism. The family tradition setup doesn't fully pay off through narrative progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushroom garden rendered with rich tactile details ("rough as tree bark") and auditory imagination ("laughter through silence"). The timeframe enhances atmosphere through the evening's deepening shadows.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphor of silent bells mirroring emotional suppression is powerful. The ending's thematic synthesis of apathy as protective armor achieves emotional resonance. Subtle showing through symbolic actions outweighs occasional exposition.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Some elegant natural imagery ("shadows dance like memories") but certain phrases ("barbed wire arms") verge on overdetermined symbolism. Tension between wonder and apathy avoids formulaic resolution.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Assigned elements cohere through Milo's perspective - the crumpled map evolves meaningfully, family tradition enables character examination, and mushroom setting becomes narrative engine. Resists overt moralizing.</comment>
