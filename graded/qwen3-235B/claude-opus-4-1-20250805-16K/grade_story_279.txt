<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Character's parched nature is underutilized beyond surface-level descriptions; motivation is clear but lacks psychological depth or emotional nuance, making Kira feel more like a concept than a fully realized individual. Her voice remains flat despite narration.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically through data collection leading to revelation, but the time-skip between days feels artificial. The arc is complete but lacks tension or stakes that would elevate it beyond a cerebral exercise within the constrained word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting of a library within a sentient book is evocatively realized, with sensory details (ink color shifts, paper canyons) deeply entwined with the climate theme. Atmosphere enhances both character and concept, though some elements risk overshadowing narrative substance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong metaphorical resonance (climate as living text) and lyrical prose elevate the story, though emotional impact is tempered by abstraction. The ending ties thematic threads neatly but leans heavily on poetic vagueness over visceral connection.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Original premise with fresh metaphors ("climate DNA") avoids tropes, but some overwritten passages (e.g., "electric peace") border on artificial grandeur. Nuanced character psychology and subtext are minimal, leaning on concept over human complexity.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elements integrate cohesively within the speculative framework, but the story leans too heavily on its own ingenuity. The brevity works, though certain choices (e.g., timeframe treatment) feel underexplored rather than intentional, diluting full thematic potential.</comment>
