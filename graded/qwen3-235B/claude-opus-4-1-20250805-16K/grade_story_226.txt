<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character motivations (collecting lullabies as emotional preservation) are clear and consistent, but deeper psychological complexity is undercut by excessive poetic abstraction that occasionally obscures human nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot structure demonstrates tight economy within constraints, but the transformation from orchardist to sound-keeper feels abbreviated despite effective symbolic progression.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Eerie, hyper-specific sensory details (hollow skull sockets, humming concrete, bone-conducted vibrations) create a cohesive, immersive world where technology and memory haunt each other.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical prose balances metaphor and subtext (songs as seeds, silence as cultivable), though some emotional beats rely on atmospheric suggestion over concrete character experience.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes through idiosyncratic combinations (electromagnetic lullabies, grafting rhythms as lost music) while maintaining precise, purposeful language without excess ornamentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Elements merge into thematically resonant whole; brief length emphasizes mythic quality rather than limitation, leaving haunting questions about memory's tangible and intangible forms.</comment>
