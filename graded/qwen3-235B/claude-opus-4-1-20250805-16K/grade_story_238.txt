<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character consistency maintained but emotional depth relies too heavily on poetic abstraction; motivations felt intuitive rather than earned through concrete decisions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fragmented structure works for atmospheric tension but sacrifices narrative cohesion; cyclical ending feels both poignant and structurally evasive.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dreamlike sensory details (cracked leather becoming stars) create visceral atmosphere, though some shifts between realities lack anchoring specifics.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (wallet as liminal vessel, light as life force) resonate, but emotional beats occasionally lean on poetic vagueness rather than earned specificity.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Worldbuilding shows ingenuity but occasionally slips into familiar Gothic tropes (abandoned carnival, haunted barkeep); language remains purposeful despite occasional ornamental phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong emotional hook and inventive use of form coexist with structural ambiguity; succeeds as a melancholic mood piece more than a fully realized narrative arc.</comment>
