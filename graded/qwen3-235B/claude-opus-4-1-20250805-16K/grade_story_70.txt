<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Character exhibits clear transformation through sensory reactions to objects, but motivations could feel more psychologically nuanced within tight word limit. The uptight nature shapes actions well, yet emotional shifts risk oversimplification.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a coherent arc from documentation pursuit to personal revelation, with Tesla’s bulb driving momentum. Pacing balances action and introspection effectively, though some beats (e.g., bulb’s activation) lack causal depth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Greenhouse-gravestone setting provides rich metaphors (life/death, decay/renewal) and atmospheric tension. Sensory details (bottled moonlight, breathing plants) immerse readers, though some elements (glowing bulbs defying physics) border on over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Story uses vivid, specific metaphors (empary as electricity) and subtextual themes masterfully. Writing shows emotional resonance through imagery (impossible colors, shifting shadows) rather than exposition. Ending feels earned and theme-centric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Avoids genre tropes by blending historical (Tesla) and mystical elements. Language remains purposeful with minimal excess, though microscopic letters strain plausibility. Emotional progression feels earned, avoiding AI-like formula through lyrical but grounded prose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elements cohere into a unified exploration of rigidity vs. transformation. Story’s brevity enhances its metaphorical potency, leaving lingering questions about knowledge vs. feeling. Style amplifies clarity rather than obscuring it.</comment>
