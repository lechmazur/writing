<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elara’s fidgetiness fuels her urgency but remains surface-level; her motivation—stated clearly—is consistent, but her emotional depth is underexplored beyond immediate stakes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot tightly structures around remaking the Ward, with cause-effect logic clear; pacing is tense yet cohesive, though resolution feels slightly abrupt within the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details (lavender, chalk notes) and setting contrasts decay with growth; tone blends hope/terror, though stellar timing and chaos creatures lack deeper mythos.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Harnesses metaphor (music vs. math) and earns emotional payoff through visual symbolism; theme of perseverance resonates but lacks subtext beyond immediate narrative.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh use of elemental keys and mechanical magic avoids genre tropes; avoids “telling” emotions, but some contrived transitions (e.g., chalkboard’s existence) flirt with formulaic setups.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements are purposeful and interwoven; the lavender field and keys particularly elevate setting and method, though the star-as-timer device feels less imaginative.</comment>
