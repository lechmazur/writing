<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Character is conceptually vivid but lacks emotional depth; motivations feel thematic rather than psychologically compelling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh metaphors (“frequency of yearning”) elevate the tale, but occasional ornate phrasing (e.g., “hauntingly cheerful”) risks self-indulgence.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements work synergistically; concise length feels intentional, though some conceptual weight (e.g., cosmic baseball) isn’t fully resolved.</comment>
