<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's brashness and connection to war medal are present but underdeveloped; motivations align with actions but lack psychological depth; the nautilus shell interaction hints at thematic purpose without full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plotted with clear arc despite brevity; the nautilus-shell method propels the action logically; detonation payoff feels purposeful yet slightly rushed; beginning/end connection strong via metallic legacy imagery.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Foggy fluorescent-lit discount store with dancing dust particles creates hauntingly mundane-surreal contrast; sensory fusion (humming technology, metallic filings' texture) builds cohesive atmosphere where ancient/modern collide.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Metaphors (dust as "electromagnetic poetry," nautilus as knowledge carrier) deepen subtext; ending achieves haunting tenderness; tension between preservation/destruction maintained; shows rather than states most themes.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Avoids most formulaic traps; speculative tech feels inventive rather than derivative; some phrases flirt with ornate abstraction but mostly serve story; emotional subtext (legacy as burden/gift) feels human rather than algorithmic.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cohesion achieved through metallic motifs; brevity amplifies mythic qualities; emotional payoff hinges on reader's acceptance of electromagnetic encoding premise; leaves lingering meditation on preservation.</comment>
