<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Symbolic abstraction prioritized over deep character psychology; her 'motivation' derives from setting rather than nuanced interiority, but the chosen traits are consistently embodied in actions and imagery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elegiac stasis substituted for traditional plot; coherence maintained through thematic echoes but lacks dramatic momentum or concrete cause-effect progression within the compressed scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Jarring tactile details (water-stained cardboard, metallic-feather microscars) create immersive post-apocalyptic texture; atmosphere permeates every sensory plane while serving character and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Metaphor density reaches visionary potency (acidity as both literal/figurative degradation, puzzle pieces as fractured history); ending transcends setup through thematic symmetry rather than narrative resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Avoids apocalypse clich√©s but occasionally lapses into ornate description ("prickly wonder"); emotional resonance emerges through subtext rather than direct expression, though some descriptors verge on overwritten.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Element interdependence is unusually tight despite brevity; each choice (melted crown, calloused hands) functions as thematic mechanism rather than arbitrary embellishment, sustaining conceptual rigor beneath poetic surface.</comment>
