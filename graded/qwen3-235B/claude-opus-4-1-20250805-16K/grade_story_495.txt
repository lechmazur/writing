<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clear motivation to reclaim lost joy aligns with Ezra's character arc, but his 'dangerously friendly' trait remains underexplored while backstory feels compressed rather than organic.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Arc is intact but compressed. Inciting incident and climax arrive efficiently yet feel rushed in a word-bound story that could better balance atmospheric pauses with narrative urgency.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sensory details (copper platforms, oil-rust mural) create immersive tension between mechanical sterility and human warmth; spacetime descriptions lack equivalent specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elicits emotional resonance through symbolic actions (bread paddle as torch, dismantled control panels). Metaphor-laden ending deepens themes but risks overwrought abstraction.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Originality shines in bread paddle symbolism and mechanical/organic contrasts, but spacetime postcards and impossible doors borrow heavily from speculative tropes without fresh context.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively despite word limits, though some assigned concepts feel curated rather than organic. The sanctuary's silence-to-laughter resonance lingers powerfully.</comment>
