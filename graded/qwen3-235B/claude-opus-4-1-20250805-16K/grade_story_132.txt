<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strength in Vespa's impulsiveness driving the climax, but underdeveloped nuance in connecting her "sly" traits to specific actions beyond the final subversion; motivations are clear but could use subtler psychological conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tight arc between discovery and rebellion, but pacing issues in condensing the prophecy's manufactured nature into a brief reveal; some rushed transitions between introspection and action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lush, cohesive worldbuilding with the fungal ecosystem; sensory details (bioluminescence, spore-fall) and setting-as-character elevate the stakes, though deeper integration with Vespa's agency could enhance it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphoric richness of the blank ticket and mycelial symbolism; the theme of resisting control through noncompliance resonates, though emotional depth could be more "felt" than intellectually conveyed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, specific details and inventive metaphors; some phrasing ("serene upheaval") teeters on abstraction, while the subversion of AI-like trope expectations is effective if not entirely fresh.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</question><comment>Strong cohesion across elements; the brevity supports a contained parable-like structure, though a more daring stylistic risk (e.g., nonlinear narrative) might have elevated it further.</comment>
