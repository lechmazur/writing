<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character's apathy and laziness are consistent but motivations lack emotional depth; her actions align with traits but voice doesn't fully embody first-person potential.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot has clear arc through coffee-driven summoning and reef emergence, but pacing feels slightly compressed for emotional weight; coherence maintained despite tight constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through sensory contrasts (bleached coral vs coffee aroma), though dream studio details occasionally feel underexplored to limit.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Masterful use of metaphor/symbolism (coffee as "earth-memory," frames recording "absence"); ending resonates thematically; subtle subtext about creation emerges powerfully.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original approach subverts "heroic action" tropes; avoids clich√© through poetic precision; no formulaic elements; emotional resonance is evoked through subtext, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements blend seamlessly to explore agency vs. passivity; brevity feels intentional; leaves lingering meditation on ecological and creative processes.</comment>
