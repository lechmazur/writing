<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marlowe’s varied freelance roles inform her cunning but lack deeper integration into her emotional core; Haversham’s desperation is clear but underexplored. Dialogue reveals motivation efficiently but could use more dimensionality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Concise yet cohesive three-act structure via wedding framing; cause/effect of consciousness transfer twist is logical but relies heavily on convenient expertise. Pacing balances momentum and introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Steam, brass, and muttering equations create immersive steampunk tension; the engine room’s mechanical breath harmonizes with themes of fragmented wholes. Atmosphere amplifies emotional stakes through sensory precision.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (scattered harmonies, emotional residue) deepen theme; ending’s "lingering thought" of wisdom as trust resonates. Subtext elevates surface plot. Dialogue sharp, sparse, purposeful.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Originality in subverting "consciousness theft" trope; nuance in Haversham’s vulnerability avoids total villainy. Avoids purple prose but occasional abstraction ("scattered harmonies") borders on overwrought.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>All elements interwoven without feeling forced; brevity serves narrative efficiency. Leaves thematic resonance about intergenerational trust, though emotional payoff hinges on slight setup.</comment>
