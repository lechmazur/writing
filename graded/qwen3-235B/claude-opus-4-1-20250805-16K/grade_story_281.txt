<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strength: Marcus's voice through structured verse reveals internal conflict. Weakness: Sudden transformation from thief to self-aware protagonist feels underdeveloped despite poetic epiphany.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strength: Dummy's challenge directly drives plot to thematic resolution. Weakness: Pacing accelerates abruptly from cryptic dialogue to transformation without sufficient emotional grounding.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strength: Rust-stained machinery and salt air create tactile decay. Weakness: Atmospheric elements like "corroded pipes" echo character state but could deepen through more sensory contrasts.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strength: Dummy as metaphor for entrapment and verse as exorcism create layered meaning. Weakness: Final line "Transform at last" risks heavy-handedness undercutting subtlety.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strength: Impromptu poetry as method avoids genre clich√©s. Weakness: "Confusing lucidity" through dummy's voice occasionally veers into abstract vagueness rather than earned revelation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strength: Compelling synthesis of existential themes within tight structure. Weakness: Poetic conceit occasionally overwhelms character logic, creating tension between form and authenticity.</comment>
