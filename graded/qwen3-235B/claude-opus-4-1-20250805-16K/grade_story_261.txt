<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Markov's near-immortality informs his perspective but lacks psychological depth; emotional stakes remain surface-level despite his historical connection to Dr. Chen. Motivation is clear but one-dimensionally loyal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear three-act arc within constraints, but restoration sequence feels rushed. Connection between ink patterns and system reboot lacks explained logic despite poetic resonance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vivid sci-fi imagery creates atmosphere, but underutilizes sensory details (e.g., texture of plastic, taste of ink). Tone contrasts effectively with setting, but consistency falters during restoration climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like "quantum fruit" and "rigidly flexible" offer strong thematic resonance. The ending delivers circularity but emotional impact remains muted by overly abstract character motivations.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Original premise with quantum orchard concept avoids genre tropes, but ink-based restoration veers toward contrived. Writing style balances poetic and precise, though some descriptions (e.g., "living light butterflies") border on aesthetic overload.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Successfully synthesizes assigned elements into thematically coherent narrative; the brief's constraints feel purposeful rather than restrictive. The cyclical nature of erasure/restoration suggests deeper philosophical inquiry.</comment>
