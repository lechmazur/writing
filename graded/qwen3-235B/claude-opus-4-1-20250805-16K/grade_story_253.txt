<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Polite bandit trait is distinct and shapes actions, but motivations could benefit from more personal stakes beyond broad betrayals. Monologuing to terminals feels contrived rather than organically revealing character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clear arc from intrusion to refusal exists, but compressed pacing and the harp's abstract connection to quantum time mechanics strain cause-effect logic. The tight word limit weakens the resolution's weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Evocative details like light-shivered code and fiber-optic harp strings create a haunting atmosphere. However, combining electronic wilderness with classroom silence creates tonal dissonance that clashes with the otherwise cohesive cyberpunk aesthetic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sophisticated metaphors ("stealing moments") and thematic exploration of time mastery as acceptance rather than control elevate the narrative. Some poetic flourishes risk overshadowing clarity, but the ending's philosophical weight resonates powerfully.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong individual imagery but uneven phrasing: "temporal mastery beckoned" feels clich√©d while "broken music creating windows into every when" shows invention. Emotional subtlety exists but occasionally yields to direct statements about humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</question><comment>Narrative cohesion holds despite complex elements. The harp's mystical-technological function strains plausibility, but the ending's thematic resonance and efficient worldbuilding within constraints demonstrate thoughtful execution that feels deliberate rather than constricted.</comment>
