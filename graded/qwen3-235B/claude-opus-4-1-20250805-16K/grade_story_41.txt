<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Character motivation is vivid but occasionally simplistic; cosmic inheritance drives Marcus's actions cohesively, but internal conflict feels streamlined rather than deeply textured.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from ritual preparations to transcendence, though the corridor's menace and abyssal visions could benefit from tighter cause-effect linkage within the constrained word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Industrial magic realism evoked through tactile contrasts (factory grease vs. cosmic dust) and unsettling architectural transitions creates a memorably uncanny atmosphere.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elements generally serve thematic unity, though the "ordered disarray" and "academically wild" details feel slightly performative rather than organically narrative-driven.</comment>
