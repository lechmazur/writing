<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation tied to personal loss and scientific ambition is clear, but the 'dutiful sentinel' aspect lacks depth. Actions center on revenge/proof rather than duty. Emotional stakes hinted at but underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot drives forward through hair clip's release, but lab-turned-wedding-venue's dual use feels strained. Cause-effect clear but rushed; wedding setup lacks full integration with the climax's stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lab wedding venue mashup creates compelling atmosphere. Sensory details about writhing plants/organic light immerse reader, but lab setting's scientific specifics don't fully inform emotional arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Evocative metaphors (darkness as presence, plants as tiny suns) create thematic resonance. Climactic transformation balances spectacle with emotional weight, though dialogue remains functional rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Subverts scientific tropes through bioluminescent plants' rebellion. Some phrasing leans toward poetic abstraction over clarity (e.g., "photosynthesis reverse"). Subtext about storytelling conventions is intriguing but underexplored.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Elements tightly integrated except shared table/restaurant detail. Science-wedding clash creates conceptual urgency, but emotional impact diluted by occasionally opaque syntax and uneven tonal shifts.</comment>
