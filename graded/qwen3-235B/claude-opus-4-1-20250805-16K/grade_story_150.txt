<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character's outlaw past and poet present merge compellingly but lack psychological depth; motivations around redemption remain inconsistently interrogated despite strong conceptual duality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Compact arc exists but pacing lurches between revelations; cause-effect between dice, text messages, and character decisions insufficiently earned within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steampunk aesthetics vividly rendered but inconsistently integrated; shifting wall text creates immersive unease but its thematic purpose remains underdeveloped despite atmospheric strengths.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors like 'poetry cracking minds like safes' resonate; ending achieves thematic elevation through implied paradigm shift, though emotional weight occasionally undercut by overly-expository text messages.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Original elements (bone dice, cosmic thread) juxtapose well but genre tropes (dying shaman, astronomer's daughter) feel contrived; shifts between ornate prose and abrupt declarative statements reveal structural fissures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>High-concept framework executed with technical proficiency but thematic coherence occasionally sacrificed to genre hybridization; ambitious idea outweighs execution's occasional formulaic tendencies.</comment>
