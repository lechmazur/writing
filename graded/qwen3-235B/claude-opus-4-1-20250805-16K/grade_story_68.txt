<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's moral imperative is clear but somewhat flat—his defiance lacks layered emotional contradictions that might humanize his certainty. Motivational clarity outweighs depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Precision-timed pacing drives plot effectively, though the sudden resolution via uploading feels narratively abrupt despite thematic justification. Strong throughline with minor structural hiccups.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Virtual Rome's sensory contrasts (data hums vs. garum smells) and Servilia's embedded history create a potent, immersive atmosphere that directly serves thematic stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</question><grade>Powerful exploration of resistance through digital archaeology; the final toast to Servilia delivers emotional resonance. Some tell-over-show in moralizing moments weakens impact.</grade>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Original approach avoids genre clichés in concept but occasionally slips into clinical prose ("quantum-encrypted data," "anonymously hands") that undercuts emotional texture.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements mesh tightly within the speculative framework—the bottle caps' paradoxical nature, Servilia's suppressed philosophy, and Marcus' deadline-bound hack form a cohesive, idea-driven narrative with lingering existential weight.</comment>
