<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prince's history as exile shapes actions, but his internal conflict feels underexplored despite resonant physical details; emotional beats are clear but thinly drawn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closed-room tension propels progression effectively, but the storm-as-device borders on contrivance; symbolic lock-turning provides satisfying structural bookending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sensory alchemy with dust motes, brass patina, and snow muffling create immersive decay that mirrors emotional states; setting breathelessly informs atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Metaphors (lock as emotional closure, mortar as sorrow-transformer) resonate thematically; ending eschews melodrama for quiet transcendence but lacks deeper subtextual layers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Occasional descriptive lushness (e.g., "melody remembered from childhood") skirts purple prose; characterization avoids tropes through understated gestures rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Constraint enhances focus on micro-cosmic emotional truth; all elements serve melancholy-into-connection arc without friction, though worldbuilding occasionally draws attention to itself.</comment>
