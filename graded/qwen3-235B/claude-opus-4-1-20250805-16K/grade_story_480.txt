<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Limited character depth beyond surface traits; motivation of "curiosity" drives plot but lacks layered psychology; "quietly loud" trait applies more to setting than internal conflict; voice inconsistently distinct despite philosophical dialogue.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot progresses logically with tight cause-effect, but climax feels abrupt; strong bookending with mess hall framing, yet transition to "analog resurrection" strains credulity within word constraints; pacing mostly controlled but lacks emotional payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Evocative sensory fragments (wet concrete, fading chords) create eerie atmosphere, but settings remain underdeveloped; tension between digital/physical realms hinted but could be more viscerally rendered; marginal connection between timeframe ("after final chord") and narrative momentum.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metaphors (receipts>profiles, "cemetery" internet) thought-provoking; ending's thematic payoff about analog anonymity resonates; show-don't-tell achieved unevenly - "raw edge" and "indifferent enthusiasm" feel occasionally stated rather than embodied; dialogue purposeful but stylized.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids AI clich√©s with unique premise and fresh metaphors; some phrases ("quietly loud") verge on contrived lyricism but mostly serve theme; emotional subtext emerges through actions rather than exposition; tone consistent despite conceptual density; minor purple prose in atmospheric descriptors.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elements cohere around anonymity themes but feel occasionally checklist-driven; brevity enhances mystery but sacrifices character nuance; subtext about digital erasure works best through concrete details; lingering questions outweigh lingering resonance; stylistic risks mostly succeed.</comment>
