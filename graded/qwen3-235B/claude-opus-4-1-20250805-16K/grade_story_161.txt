<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Character motivation is clear (avenging daughter) and aligns with his orchardist background/focus on patterns, but secondary characters remain flat. The "sardonic glee" feels performative rather than deeply integrated into Marcus's emotional complexity.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Plot has strong visual highs (UV plane reveal) and logical connective tissue (patterns → toxin dispersal), but the abrupt FBI resolution and WikiLeaks upload feel rushed within the constraints. The peacock-toxin linkage is clever but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting relies on conceptual novelty (paper airplane facility) without visceral sensory details—smells of pesticide, hum of machinery, or texture of UV powder missing. Atmosphere leans too heavily on reader acceptance of absurd premise.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Metaphors (origami Havens crumbling, dove symbolism) and thematic parallels between natural patterns and human-engineered destruction elevate impact. Over-explanation of plot mechanics occasionally undermines subtlety, but the final image of the dove plane lingers.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Relies on revenge thriller tropes (omniscient avenger exposing conspiracy) with uneven stylistic choices—the "badly folded origami" metaphor works, but phrases like "nature's perfect spiral geometry" veer toward florid. Emotional subtext (grief beneath vengeance) feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elements combine in surprising ways (paper planes as weapon dispersal tools), but the story relies too heavily on external plot devices (leaked passwords, pre-arranged FBI) rather than organic tension. The conceit remains conceptually strong despite execution flaws.</comment>
