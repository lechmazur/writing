<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marlow's defiance and trauma are visceral, her voice sharp and purposeful. Hayes serves as a weak contrast but lacks depth, reducing the confrontation's emotional weight.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong episodic structure within constraints, but pivotal moments between confrontation and escape/prophecy feel compressed. The cosmic echoes' function lacks explanation, undermining plot logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hyper-sensory mirror maze (phosphorescent rust, phantom music) merges physical and metaphysical. The orchard cat's temporal symbolism elevates the setting beyond tropes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Mirror multiplication as resistance metaphor, rope as ancestral chain-breaker, and echoes as collective memory create layered symbolism. The ending's mythic resonance transcends the immediate conflict.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Avoids predictability in cosmic echo transmission mechanics, but the orchard cat's symbolic weight feels externally imposed. Some over-reliance on "calculated wilderness" abstraction.</comment>
