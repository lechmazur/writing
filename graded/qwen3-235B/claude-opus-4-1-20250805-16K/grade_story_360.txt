<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mirin’s meekness as a necromancer is distinct but underexplored; her motivation (solving the riddle) is clear, yet her internal conflict lacks visceral nuance beyond intellectual longing. The broken pen and goblins’ advice partially reveal her voice, but her transformation feels abrupt without deeper emotional anchoring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot’s arc—struggle, epiphany, resolution—is precise within the word limit. The dewdrop’s revelation drives the action logically, with cause-effect coherence. Pacing balances reflection and progression, achieving a satisfying arc without feeling overstuffed or hollow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The phosphorescent moss, goblin city, and interplay of playground sounds create vivid sensory immersion. The setting’s bioluminescent atmosphere and the surface/underground contrast deepen the theme. Details feel purposefully tied to character and concept, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The dewdrop metaphor and “tangled tapestry” resonate with poetic economy. The ending’s thematic clarity—impermanence as beauty—evokes a reflective, almost Buddhist stillness. Show-don’t-tell is mastered, with the pen’s rebirth and inverted city image enriching the subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Avoids necromancy clichés by framing death as a dialogue, not domination. The goblins’ sincerity and the broken pen’s symbolism feel inventive, not formulaic. Prose balances precision with lyricism, avoiding purple prose while maintaining emotional gravity through imagery over explicit declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements harmonize into a cohesive whole: setting, character, and concept merge to explore life/death duality. The brief span feels deliberate, with each detail sharpening the theme. The ending lingers, inviting philosophical reflection, not mere narrative closure.</comment>
