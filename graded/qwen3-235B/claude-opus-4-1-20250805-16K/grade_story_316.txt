<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thalia's timidity informs her initial reluctance to lead but her devotion to Marcus's memory drives her arc. The transition from shadow-work to leadership feels narratively expedient; the character's "voice" remains too muted for full emotional resonance despite symbolic actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot moves from desolate ruin to revelation through well-structured clues, but the arcade-scoreboard cipher stretches credibility. The resolution ties back to the factory's end, though the hidden chamber's discovery feels too convenient for narrative logic despite thematic payoff.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post-industrial decay fused with repurposed antiquity creates haunting atmosphere. Strong sensory textures (temple's cold stone, fluoro ghosts) bolster mood, though the temple's specific transformation into a textile commune lacks socio-historical fleshing that could deepen immersion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Powerful symbolism—woven words as literal and metaphorical healing—elevates the narrative. Subtext about memory and reinvention resonates; emotional depth emerges through tactile imagery rather than exposition. The ending transcends sentimentality through concretely rendered collective action.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The arcade-scoreboard cipher strains believability, echoing formulaic mystery tropes. Some descriptors ("scattered harmony," "seraphic") lean ornate but serve thematic cohesion. The synthesis of temple, plague, and arcade feels ambitious but occasionally forced rather than organically integrated.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story's interwoven elements form a cohesive meditation on preservation. Each mandated detail contributes meaningfully, though the temple's historical transition and scoreboard's purpose require narrative heavy lifting. The economy of storytelling within constraints proves impressive despite minor contrivances.</comment>
