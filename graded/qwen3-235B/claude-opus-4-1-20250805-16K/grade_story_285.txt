<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation (restoring tradition) is clear, but internal conflict feels secondary to metaphysical elements. Awkwardness is stated more than demonstrated, and emotional reactions lack depth beyond surface-level descriptors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc between pursuit and revelation, but the rush to resolve through mystical summoning strains coherence. The concept-driven ending feels abrupt despite effective setup in earlier sections.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is atmospheric and sensorily immersive, blending tundra harshness with ghostly thermal vents to mirror character duality. Geothermal/tundra juxtaposition masterfully reinforces theme of conflicting worlds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (hermit crabs, steam, postcards) create layered subtext. Ending lacks emotional payoff through showing, relying instead on abstract victory. Writing style is polished but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over narrative intimacy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Combines genre elements (arctic fantasy, courtroom intrigue) with unique metaphors but occasionally veers into overwrought symbolism. Emotional beats verge on abstraction rather than earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>Demonstrates craftsmanship through strong atmosphere and concept, but deeper character engagement would elevate it from ambitious to masterful. Certain magical logic prioritizes metaphor over narrative causality.</grade>
