<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character is emotionally engaged but lacks depth in motivations beyond ancestral preservation; reactions are sincere but lack nuanced internal conflict.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from preparation to revelation, though some transitions (e.g., tractor journey) feel underdeveloped in tight word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Arctic setting and aurora create visceral contrast with historical oppression; sensory details (frozen tears, tremulous light) deepen atmosphere.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Metaphors (sound trapped in dough) are inventive; emotional resonance sometimes undercut by overuse of grandiose phrasing ("cosmic ballet").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unique concept elevated by restrained prose but undercut by occasional melodrama ("weight of history finally set free") and predictable emotional beats.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elements serve the story thematically, but some (tractor journey) feel tacked-on rather than organically integrated.</comment>
