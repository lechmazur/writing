<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Marlow's dual identity as assassin and repairman lacks visceral emotional integration; his "quiet flamboyance" manifests only superficially through pocket squares rather than deeper behavioral contrasts. Motivations remain tantalizingly opaque, sacrificing human nuance for stylized paradoxes.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The plot's cyclical structure between Marlow's past/present works, but domestic mysteries feel like disconnected curiosities rather than narrative engines. The eulogy scene's promise dissolves into static atmosphere instead of propelling resolution.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Oily clockwork, green-tinged light through moss, and ticking sounds immerse readers in Marlow's liminal space. The lantern's personification as a silent witness and the water clock's mechanical pathos create haunting sensory cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Poisoned husbands against lactose intolerance, hydraulic murder techniques, and timepieces as confessionals deliver philosophical heft through absurdist juxtaposition. The final metaphor—that mendable time masks irreparable human damage—is devastatingly precise.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stylistic richness occasionally verges on self-indulgence ("terrible beauty of truth") but mostly avoids hollow ornamentation. Emotional shading emerges through symbolic objects rather than affective states, though some phrases risk preciousness.</comment>
