<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Originality shines in blending anachronistic technology with ecological memory; only minor overuse of metaphor ("careful wildness") and slightly predictable character arcs prevent perfection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</question><comment>Story transcends its constraints through tightly interwoven elements that cumulatively create a haunting question about perception, though some thematic statements lean toward explicitness.</comment>
