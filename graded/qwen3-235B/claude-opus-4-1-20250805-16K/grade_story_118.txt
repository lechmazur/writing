<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dr. Vera’s hive-mind persona shows promise but lacks depth in showing how “uniformly peculiar” traits shape her actions. Morrison’s motivation (regret) is clear but underdeveloped; his reactions to the wax and dialogue with Vera lack nuanced emotional texture, relying on explicit emotional statements.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Plot progression is logical (regret → therapy → resolution), but the 500-word limit strains coherence. The wax method drives the action, yet the resolution feels abrupt. Cause-effect (regret to wisdom) is clear, but the story’s brevity flattens the arc, leaving key emotional beats underexplored.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret agent facility and “eve of discovery” frame the urgency but lack immersion. Sensory details (spark of charger, candle wax) are sparse and functional rather than atmospheric. The “merry bitterness” tone clashes inconsistently with the high-stakes setting, undercutting mood cohesion.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolism (wax shapes as regret) and the theme of regret-as-weapon resonate. The ending’s resolution (“teacher, not tormentor”) is satisfying but leans on exposition. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful; the writing avoids overt purple prose, though some metaphors (e.g., “bitter honey laugh”) feel overwrought.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mix of fresh (regret-as-physical-wax) and familiar (traumatized hero, therapist-as-savior) elements. The hive-mind and hindsight chimes avoid cliché but lack subversive depth. Emotional resonance is partially shown (wax dissolution) but often told (“secondhand sorrow”). Language remains mostly accessible, though the charger’s symbolism feels contrived.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elements are functional rather than symbiotic. The hive-mind and wax method add originality, but the story’s brevity prevents cohesive integration. The ending hints at thematic depth (regret → wisdom) but feels rushed. Raises questions about memory’s role in trauma, but lacks lingering impact.</comment>
