<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlena’s duality as a fraud with genuine visions shapes her actions effectively, but her abrupt transformation in the archive lacks emotional depth. Her voice is distinct but her internal logic occasionally feels underexplored.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot’s momentum from vision to discovery is compelling, but the tight word limit strains the cause-effect chain (e.g., curator’s leniency, swift identification of the flute). The ending’s circularity is strong despite pacing hiccups.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prague’s labyrinthine streets and the archive’s atmosphere immerse the reader. Sensory details (rain, dust, hum of the flute) ground the story’s mysticism. The setting as a character is exceptionally well-executed.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Linguistic evolution as sacred ritual is a fresh lens. The fusion of prophecy with language’s origins is thematic gold. Marlena’s final line (“fortune doesn’t always mean future”) crystallizes the story’s philosophical weight.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Few clichés; the “hidden archive” trope is elevated by the extinct language angle. Some phrases (e.g., “peaceful anger”) risk pretension but mostly succeed. Emotional nuance feels earned, not mechanical.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elements interlock tightly (visions → Prague → bone flute → lost languages), though “taken chances” feels secondary. The brief arcs (fraud to truth-seeker, fragment to revelation) are concise but precise. Leaves a lingering cerebral resonance.</comment>
