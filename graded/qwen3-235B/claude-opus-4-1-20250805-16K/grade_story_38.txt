<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character lacks depth; motivations shift suddenly without sufficient internal conflict exploration beyond surface-level metaphors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clear but compressed arc; some plot developments (botanist's journal revelation) feel rushed and undercontextualized within the word limit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Visually rich, immersive atmosphere; however, some sensory details (e.g., "whispers" metaphors) become repetitive rather than cumulative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong thematic execution (restraint vs. violence) undercut by occasional overtness in conveying ideas (direct statements about "empty abundance").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but includes familiar elements (haunted spaces, tortured artists) without sufficiently subverting expectations about redemption arcs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Competently structured with cohesive themes but uneven utilization of assigned elements disrupts potential for exceptional impact.</comment>
