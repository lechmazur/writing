<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but surface-level; emotional complexity lacks deeper, nuanced exploration of a thug's redemption through remorse. Dialogue hints at psychology but doesn't fully inhabit Marcus's internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear arc from burden to release exists, but pacing feels compressed; plot beats (police encounter, crate revelation) drive the story unevenly within tight constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Static electricity garden creates distinctive atmosphere through sensory details ("blue sparks," crackling coats), but fails to deepen thematic resonance about transformative resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbolic use of wooden slat and electric setting creates memorable imagery; dialogue-driven emotional revelations lack subtext; ending achieves thematic coherence with slight artificiality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Overall concept avoids major clich√©s, but contains occasional overly polished phrasing ("electric whispers," "hair stand on end"); some emotional states are explicitly stated rather than embedded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements combine cohesively but unevenly; static garden and crate slat stand out, while rationally subjective framing feels contrived; theme of transformation resonates but lacks lingering depth.</comment>
