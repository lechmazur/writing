<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character exhibits layered motives (nonviolence vs institutional corruption) with symbolic actions, but connection between being a birdwatcher and cosmic chaos feels underdeveloped. Nuanced emotional arc exists but could deepen through sensory embodiment.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cosmic blink constraint creates tension. Transformation of data into poetry resolves the conflict neatly, though the office's unraveling borders on abstract vagueness. Pacing balances introspective moments with decisive action.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dystopian bureaucratic atmosphere well-crafted through sterile imagery (fluorescent hums, marble mirrors), but the leaf classification premise lacks integration with ecological themes. Sensory details prioritize visual/symbolic over tactile specificity.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Striking metaphoric layering (nonviolence as "unraveling," migration songs vs algorithms) elevates the narrative. Ending achieves thematic resonance through poetic subversion. Some poetic abstractions risk vagueness but overall memorable.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Subverts expectations (revolution as creation, not destruction). Avoids clich√©d rebellion tropes. Some metaphors (bitterness into flight song) lean on familiar emotional trajectories, but the generational chaos concept feels fresh and human.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Story tightly integrates most elements but relies heavily on poetic abstraction to bind them. Leaves lingering conceptual questions about data-as-poetry's real-world impact, which could be intentional. Style occasionally obscures clarity but serves thematic ambition.</comment>
