<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character's dry tongue and struggle with voice loss drive her emotional arc, but interiority relies too heavily on abstract existential phrasing rather than specific humanizing details.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot follows a clear emotional progression from paralysis to revelation, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in its metaphysical implications about silence/sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vivid visual and sensory details (bioluminescent mushrooms, spore-dust) create atmosphere, but the surreal setting occasionally veers into decorative excess without narrative purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Exquisite imagery ("digital amber," "refracting sound") elevates the theme of memory-as-music, though some metaphors overreach (e.g., "gorgeously awkward silence").</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Originality shines in conceit (recording technology in fungal world), but some descriptions (phosphorescent gills, prison-of-self) border on poetic clich√© without deeper subversion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>All elements cohere conceptually, with precise emotional trajectory; brevity serves thematic focus but leaves some worldbuilding implications unexplored.</comment>
