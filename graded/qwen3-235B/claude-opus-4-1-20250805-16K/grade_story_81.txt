<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Character motivations are present but shallow; physicist's transformation from conqueror to guardian lacks emotional grounding, and the advisor is more mystical device than fully realized person.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Plot is concept-driven with minimal conflict or progression; time paradox exposition dominates over earned development, but maintains structural coherence within constraints.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid sensory details like "oxidation spreading like watercolor" and "driftwood from tomorrow's ocean" create a haunting atmosphere that flawlessly reinforces the theme of time's fragility.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rich metaphors ("museum of moments") and thematic depth about time's emotional resonance create lingering impact, though emotional payoff is diluted by exposition-heavy delivery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Avoids overt clich√©s but contains underdeveloped literary devices; the "coin shaped by temporal pressure" feels fresh, yet some phrases ("whispers of futures lived") risk poetic overkill without character grounding.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion exists but execution prioritizes ideas over narrative; the physicist's arc remains intellectual rather than visceral, though the central theme of time-as-empathy is thought-provoking.</comment>
