<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Wealth of atmospheric detail compensates for underdeveloped protagonist; "nondescript" choice limits emotional engagement despite cleverly tying to her role as observer. Motivations feel externally imposed rather than organically earned.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tight pacing through economical scene transitions balances slight predictability of "mysterious drive leads to revelation" structure; biological encryption mechanism strains credibility despite poetic logic. Resolution feels earned yet formulaic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Drought-breaking atmosphere masterfully mirrors thematic concerns; specific olfactory details (petrichor, champagne) create immersive specificity. Control tower's decay lacks direct narrative consequence despite strong visual imprint.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphor of truth as rainwater eroding secrets demonstrates elegant subtext; the "justice arriving" refrain avoids cliché through concrete imagery. Ending's thematic resonance outweighs minimal character interiority.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Unique climate-dependent encryption mechanism avoids cliché, though seer's detached omniscience owes more to genre conventions than psychological realism. Prose walks tightrope between lyrical precision and schematic theme-presentation.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Degree of difficulty in juggling 10 required elements is admirably masked through thematic cohesion; atmospheric components dominate over character work, creating slight tonal imbalance in ambitious framework.</comment>
