<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Character motivations are clear but underexplored; her status as a "irate" smuggler informs actions but lacks psychological complexity. The chopstick as a memory trigger is effective, but internal conflict remains surface-level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Plot progression through tea-leaf patterns is inventive but under-explained, slightly undermining the mystery's resolution. Pacing is taut yet cohesive despite word constraints; the cyclical structure (morning jog to discovery) satisfies within limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere excels through tactile details (weight of chopstick, tea's stain on console) and the juxtaposition of dereliction with data waterfalls. The setting's isolation amplifies the emotional desolation, though the "flight deck" feels underutilized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Elegantly weaves metaphor ("waterfalls' as data, 'heart's revolt' as rebellion against closure) with visceral storytelling. The ending's emotional duality—betrayal transmuted into earned understanding—cements thematic depth about grief as a transformative process.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through unconventional symbol (tea leaves as data maps) but occasionally strains credibility (biometric hangar doors in a corpse-like station). Language remains precise but occasionally veers into stylized brevity at the expense of organic nuance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elements are interwoven with purpose: the chopstick's symbolism, the waterfalls as both plot and thematic device, the jogging routine as a manifestation of unresolved grief. Only the tea-leaf cipher feels marginally contrived.</comment>
