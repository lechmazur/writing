<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Conceptual persona dominates over psychological depth; motivations are asserted more than dramatized through action; characterâ€™s voice lacks organic idiosyncrasies despite flamboyant monologues</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Fragmented chronology and abstract stakes dilute narrative momentum; repairs-as-plot lacks concrete tension despite poetic flourishes; beginning/end symmetry is conceptually circular but emotionally hollow</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere relies too heavily on negation ("swallowed sound/light/warranty") rather than immersive sensory paradoxes; void's potential for synesthetic horror remains underexploited</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids most AI tropes through specific artifacts (satellite love letters, prophetic water), though "deafening harmony" metaphor borders on pretentious elegance; tone balances precision and weirdness without collapse</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Glossy surrealism cannot fully compensate for emotional distance; conceptual unity compromised by competing threads (salesman persona vs. cosmic repair vs. existential monologues); feels like condensed novella concept</comment>
