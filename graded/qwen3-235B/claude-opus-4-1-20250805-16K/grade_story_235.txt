<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Characters exist as archetypes rather than rounded figures, but their motivations and method (silent communication via object repositioning) are clear. The emotionally restrained dynamic creates intrigue, though their deeper psychology remains underexplored in the limited space.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Plot structure is conceptually tight but feels compressed—arc exists between first mention of meteor shower patterns and final celestial observation, but key emotional transitions require more breathing room. Pacing falters when explaining technical details over showing emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is evocatively rendered through precise visual details (telescope, fading book spine) and the juxtaposition of samurai history with watercolor classes. Setting elements like the castle's transformation lack deeper integration to heighten thematic tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Packs profound emotional weight into poetic metaphor—flowers as language, distance as love. Literary devices are exquisitely layered, with subtext in composition choices. Ending lacks punch but the central idea lingers, elevated by show-don't-tell restraint.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Avoids clichés with the celestial decoding premise and visual communication system. Some lyrical phrasing edges toward ornamentation rather than illumination. Emotional nuance feels organically human despite the story's conceptual rigor, with minimal formulaic elements.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>All elements cohere into a unified thematic whole, though the castle and timeframe feel more functional than essential. Achieves a balance between literary ambition and narrative clarity within its constraints. Leaves the reader with haunting metaphors about connection.</comment>
