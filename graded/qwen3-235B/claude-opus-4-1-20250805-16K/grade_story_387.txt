<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's motivation to preserve history through music is evident, but lacks depth in inner conflicts or nuanced personality beyond archetypal "selfless musician." Dialogue is purposeful but sparse, limiting voice distinction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear three-act structure within word limit, but pacing feels rushed in resolution. The raider's abrupt shift to cooperation lacks sufficient causal buildup, weakening cause-effect logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong sensory details in wind chimes and ship descriptions create atmosphere, but inconsistent integration of recycled spaceship elements (e.g., playground/shopping mall debris) dilutes thematic cohesion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Metaphors tie music to memory effectively, but emotional resonance falls flat due to over-reliance on abstract terms like "savage grace" instead of concrete, character-driven subtext.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Avoids genre clich√©s through unique musical concepts, but occasionally falters with phrases like "centuries of longing" which feel generically poetic rather than sharply original.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elements are cohesively utilized but lack transformative innovation. The central metaphor works, yet the story's ambition exceeds its ability to fully integrate all assigned components into a unified whole.</comment>
