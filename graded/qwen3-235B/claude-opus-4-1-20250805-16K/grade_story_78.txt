<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Character development is present but occasionally undercut by expository dialogue. Vera's transition from librarian to reluctant leader is implied through action, but her intellectual obsession with cosmic balance feels more fully realized than her softer interpersonal dynamics with Marcus. The "softly militant" trait surfaces only in exposition rather than behavior.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pacing is expertly managed within constraints, balancing cosmic revelation with human-scale interaction. The discovery-through-spyglass structure creates clean narrative propulsion. However, the ending's thematic resolution feels slightly premature, sacrificing deeper exploration of Marcus's transformation for lyrical abstraction.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Post-apocalyptic setting is rendered through precisely observed details—the rooftop farm's "stubborn green shoots," disintegrating city painted in "amber." However, the rooftop setting could have employed more tactile textures (e.g., feel of soil, sound of wind through broken structures) to fully immerse.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Metaphors achieve sublimity (universe as composting system) while maintaining narrative urgency. Vera's recognition that "heroes are cultivated" resonates as earned theme rather than imposed message. Final line loses slight impact through grammatical parallelism with opening.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Avoids genre clichés through cosmic evolution rather than mere destruction tropes. Sensory details remain specific ("weathered hands," "disappearing stars"), but the phrase "first tear/final sigh" framework edges toward poetic abstraction at the expense of visceral emotional engagement. Subtext about information ethics is handled through earned revelation, not didacticism.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Despite compressed form, story achieves cohesion through recurring image patterns (decay/rebirth, vision/tools). Some elements (softly militant leadership) feel slightly underserved, but the integration of cosmic-scale mystery with rooftop intimacy demonstrates sophisticated narrative engineering for a short piece.</comment>
