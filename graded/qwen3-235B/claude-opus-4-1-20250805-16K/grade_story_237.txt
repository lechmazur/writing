<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina's psychic gift as a genealogist is central yet underdeveloped; her motivation is clear but her internal logic remains opaque. The captain’s grief-driven quest is compelling, though his minimal exposition weakens emotional stakes despite the pivotal revelation. Dialogue conveys "grave playfulness" effectively.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plot hinges on Marina’s psychic readings of objects and journals, executed with tight cause-and-effect. The arc from captivity to liberation is cohesive, though the transition from brig to mission occurs abruptly without resolving Marina’s own stakes or how she was captured.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Galactic imagery (morning light on cosmos, Ganymede) and sensory details (chipped die’s warmth) create atmospheric depth. The space pirate brig feels generic—missed opportunities to integrate setting with Marina’s abilities (e.g., prison’s psychometric residues).</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Metaphors like "DNA strands" and "alarm bells of heartbreak" elevate the prose. The ending resonates thematically, though emotional beats occasionally lean on dialogue rather than subtext (e.g., explicit mention of "grave playfulness").</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The psychic genealogist concept is inventive but risks pseudo-scientific jargon. The diaries-on-trains method feels contrived; reliance on exposition-heavy "decades of collection" stretches credibility. Dialogue avoids cliché but some lines border on overly poetic ("space folded like origami").</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Packs emotional and thematic depth into constraints, though questions linger (e.g., Marina’s backstory). The ending implies cyclical legacies of loss and hope, but tighter integration of the pirate setting with Marina’s role would enhance cohesion.</comment>
