<question>1</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Purely symbolic; Marlene's "awkwardness" never translates into concrete behaviors or decisions. Her motivation is stated but feels abstract rather than dramatized through actions.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Non-linear time structure works conceptually, but relies heavily on unexplained mechanics. Progression hinges on surreal revelations rather than cause-effect logic.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Visceral sensory language (crackling electricity, scent of dough) creates immersive atmosphere. The setting's temporal paradoxes enhance the baking process but remain under-explored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lyrical prose, striking metaphors ("loneliness feels crowded"), and philosophical subtext elevate the narrative. The ending achieves thematic resonance through symbolic imagery.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original ideas shine through (time-dilated baking as epiphany), but some phrases ("haunting delight") lean into nebulous abstraction. Avoids formulaic plotting but occasionally veers toward poetic vagueness.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elements function cohesively to serve the philosophy theme, with economy of structure belying its depth. The story transcends its length through layered symbolism.</comment>
