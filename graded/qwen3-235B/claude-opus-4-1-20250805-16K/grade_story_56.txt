<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character development is uneven; while Marcus's duality as a swindler burdened by truth is compelling, his motivations shift abruptly from personal gain to confession without sufficient grounding. His "energetic lethargy" influences his rhythm but isn't deeply tied to his emotional arc. The dialogue reveals some nuance, but his tremble and confession lack organic progression, veering from guarded to vulnerable without layered context.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured within the constraints, with the swindle-to-confession pivot effectively driven by the ghosts' intervention. The dropped book and price tag serve as logical, connected turning points. However, the abrupt revelation of the Algorithm’s origin feels compressed; the connection between Chen’s frozen computer and her transformation from mark to ally could be more gradual without sacrificing word count.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The post-collapse orchard within a skyscraper is vividly realized, blending decay and renewal. Sensory details—shattered windows nurturing trees, shimmering air—enhance the eerie, hopeful tone. The ghosts’ interaction with electronics and objects like the book grounds the supernatural in tangible atmosphere. The setting isn’t just backdrop but a metaphor for nature’s resilience against corporate greed, making it integral to the story’s emotional and thematic resonance.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story excels in imagery (e.g., "braille written in falling leaves") and symbolism (blank price tag as futility), with an ironic subtext about value in a ruined world. The ending delivers catharsis, though the shift to confession risks melodrama. Emotional depth is shown through gestures—trembling, lingering touches—rather than exposition. The conflict (secrecy vs. truth) is clear, but themes could be more subtly woven into Marcus’s earlier interactions.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Originality shines in reimagining skyscrapers as ecosystems and ghosts as intangible truth-bearers. The prose avoids clichés, favoring precise metaphors over ornamentation. Some phrases ("invisible allies swirled around them") lean on familiar ghostly imagery, but the ghosts’ unique mechanical influence (affecting electronics) subverts expectations. Emotional beats are shown through physical cues (trembling, paused gestures), avoiding overt tells, though Chen’s quick turn from client to confidant borders on predictable redemption tropes.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The story coalesces around a fresh, timely theme (consequences of unchecked tech), using its elements cohesively. The brevity feels intentional, leveraging the tight word count for emotional punch. However, the narrative leans heavily on the ghosts’ abrupt intervention, which, while clever, stretches plausibility within the world. It inspires reflection on collective guilt but could deepen its critique of capitalism for lasting impact.</comment>
