<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Promises depth through Marcus' motivation to defy perfection, but backstory remains underdeveloped. His "frenetic" energy drives action but lacks psychological nuance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Power outage creates organic tension. Radiant shifts escalate logically despite brevity—tight cause/effect with satisfying resolution that ties memory to modern connection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tree ring setting creates haunting timelessness through sensory details like prismatic light fractals and whispers of ancient wood, though urban elements feel slightly underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Masterful use of paradoxical imagery (imperfect illusions conveying truth) and fractal metaphors that mirror narrative structure. Emotional resonance emerges through tactile light fragments carried away.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Avoids clichés through concrete verbs ("fractals dissolve") rather than abstract "magic." Occasional heavy thematic repetition about time, but overall voice remains distinctive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elements function as both literal objects and thematic throughlines—each prismatic fragment reveals deeper human truth. Ending lingers with existential tension between imperfection and transcendence.</comment>
