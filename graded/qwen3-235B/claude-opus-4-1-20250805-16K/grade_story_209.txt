<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character is minimally explored despite the premise; motivation is clear but reactions lack depth; the woodsman's skills feel underutilized in reconciling his technical expertise with his role; the hairbrush ties to emotion but fails to fully anchor his internal transformation.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot progression is conceptually cohesive but rushes the emotional arc; the short-circuit and water tower method drive key revelations, but the transition from despair to cheer feels abrupt; the story achieves a truncated arc but strains against word constraints in balancing action and introspection.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vividly rendered with tactile and visual details (electromagnetic tendrils, corroded ladder harmonics) that ground the speculative elements; the radio wave garden’s eerie tonality complements the theme of hidden histories, though the setting’s deeper implications are underexplored.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Echoes of generational betrayal and the tension between truth and identity emerge strongly; the metaphor of maps as lies resonates thematically; the ending’s bittersweet resolve and luminous imagery linger, though some emotional beats (e.g., "despairing cheer") are told more than shown.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality is strong in merging folkloric "ghost railways" with electromagnetic mysticism, but phrases like "metal prayers" verge on pretentiousness; emotional nuance feels slightly algorithmic (e.g., the abrupt shift to "strange cheer"), though the radio wave conceit and heirloom tech avoid genre clichés.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story’s density of elements risks overwhelm, but the radio wave garden’s mystery and the hairbrush’s symbolism create cohesion; the brevity sharpens the revelation’s impact, though secondary threads (e.g., Marcus’s life’s work) are underexplored; the central twist lingers as a provocative redefinition of legacy.</comment>
