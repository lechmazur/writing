<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Character's skepticism and motivation are clear, but emotional complexity and development beyond initial traits are underdeveloped. Subtleties of her personal revelation about her mother's voice lack depth.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plot has a clear arc from discovery to epiphany, but logical gaps (thimble-to-constellation connection) and rushed star charts' reaction weaken cohesion. Pacing is efficient but occasionally strained.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Eerie, original atmosphere with rich sensory details (e.g., "loud silence") but suffers from underdeveloped temporal context and inconsistent integration of stellar setting with narrative stakes.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking metaphor use and theme of emotion-as-weather are well-executed. The ending delivers emotional resonance, though some abstract concepts lack narrative grounding.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Originality in storm-echoes concept shines, but relies on overfamiliar tropes (digitization erasing humanity) and occasionally dips into poetic vagueness over specific emotional nuance.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Story succeeds in thematic cohesion but struggles with integration of rideshare drivers and stellar setting. Brief length is both a constraint and a strength in focus on key emotional beats.</comment>
