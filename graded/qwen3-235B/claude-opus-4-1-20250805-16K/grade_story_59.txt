<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character's motivation to confront past through silence is consistent; actions (e.g., using collar's recording) reveal depth. 'Voice' in describing sound's absence shows nuance but lacks emotional grounding in lived struggles.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plot flows logically from quest to revelation. Star trails and silence mechanics drive momentum. Resolution feels slightly rushed, but circular structure ties beginning/end effectively within tight word limits.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Echo chamber's description (absorptive walls, alive void) creates haunting atmosphere. Sensory deprivation enhances mood; setting is a character itself, reinforcing theme of sound's metamorphosis.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Paradoxical feedback loop of absence and "anti-music" showcase originality. Metaphors (silence's heartbeat) are vivid; ending resonates thematically. Subtext of art's evolution transcends surface plot.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Few overwritten phrases ("almost alive again in their silence"), but inventiveness in redefining silence as art avoids formulaic beats. Emotional nuance shown through symbolic actions, not exposition.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</question><grade>All elements feel indispensable to theme; brevity enhances poetic focus. Leverages limitations to emphasize existential questions, leaving lingering metaphysical resonance.</grade>
