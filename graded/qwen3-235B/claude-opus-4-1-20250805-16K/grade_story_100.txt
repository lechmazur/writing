<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character consistency and motivation are strong, but internal conflict lacks depth. Dialogue reveals key traits but feels slightly underexplored for full emotional resonance.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plot structure follows a tight arc but relies on implied backstory rather than fully integrated narrative progression. The moon path climax feels abrupt yet conceptually cohesive.</comment>
