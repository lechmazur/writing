<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Character's brazenness lacks consistent manifestation in actions; motivations for redemption feel plausible but underexplored. The impulsively thoughtful trait surfaces effectively in charcoal decision but isn't woven into core personality.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tight three-act structure within constraints; charcoal warning resolves narrative tension through character-specific knowledge. Some rushed exposition about revolution's influence on Torven's theft.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Underwater lab's physical decay works, but revolution's social upheaval feels like backdrop. Sensory details (algae, hissing rebreather) ground reader but insufficient atmospheric differentiation between drowned lab and surface conflict.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Potent metaphors (crumbling charcoal = fading certainties) elevate theme. Ending achieves emotional resonance through subtext, though exposition about "sheltering the flame" risks overstatement.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Originality in blending maritime ritual with science, but revolution motif feels algorithmically chosen rather than organically integrated. Emotional arc avoids clich√© but relies on some tell-don't-show phrasing.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Story succeeds through thematic cohesion despite uneven element execution. Lingering questions about science-mysticism duality and redemption's possibility emerge naturally from integration of core concepts.</comment>
