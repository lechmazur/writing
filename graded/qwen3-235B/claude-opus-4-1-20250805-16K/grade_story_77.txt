<question>1</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Character traits like introversion and empathy are mentioned but don't substantially inform decisions or interactions. Motivations feel stated more than demonstrated through concrete actions or emotional layers.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plot has a clear central action (reassembling marionette) but the introduction of the asteroid's consciousness feels abrupt. Pacing is uneven—some moments linger while others race past crucial exposition.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere has poetic details (bioluminescent stars, eroded consciousness) but fails to ground the pirate hideout's cultural logic. The setting's potential as a spacefaring location feels underexploited.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Striking imagery (mountain wisdom, starfish as cosmic antenna) elevates the prose, but emotional engagement suffers from detached narration. Subtext about communication across scales is intriguing but underdeveloped.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Blends sci-fi and mythic elements inventively—astronomical danger thresholds, fossils as psychic conduits. Some poetic abstraction risks losing emotional stakes, but conceptually imaginative.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</question><grade>Elements create a thematically cohesive mosaic rather than a tightly wound mechanism. The brevity works for poetic brevity but shortchanges character growth and worldbuilding texture.</grade>
