<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character's nostalgic, menacing traits influence actions but lack emotional depth; motivations around ascending feel inconsistently developed across the ensemble-as-individual framework.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Storm-driven climax coherent but compressed; cause/effect between broken code and multiversal stitching remains abstract despite tight word count.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Uncommon metaphorical fusion of tailoring and metaphysics counteracts tropes; stumbles with overreliance on "storm as revelation" convention.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Conceptual cohesion achieved through metaphorical thread motif; element integration uneven but overall momentum holds despite ambitious scope.</comment>
